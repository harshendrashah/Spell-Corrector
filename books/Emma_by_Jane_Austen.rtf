VOLUME I\
\
\
\
CHAPTER I\
\
\
Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home\
and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of\
existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very\
little to distress or vex her.\
\
She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,\
indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister\'92s marriage, been\
mistress of his house from a very early period. Her mother had died\
too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of\
her caresses; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as\
governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.\
\
Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse\'92s family, less as a\
governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly\
of Emma. Between _them_ it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before\
Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the\
mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint;\
and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been\
living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma\
doing just what she liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor\'92s judgment, but\
directed chiefly by her own.\
\
The real evils, indeed, of Emma\'92s situation were the power of having\
rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too\
well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to\
her many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived,\
that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her.\
\
Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any\
disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor\'92s\
loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this\
beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any\
continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her father and\
herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer\
a long evening. Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as\
usual, and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost.\
\
The event had every promise of happiness for her friend. Mr. Weston\
was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\
pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering\
with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\
promoted the match; but it was a black morning\'92s work for her. The want\
of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\
past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she had\
taught and how she had played with her from five years old--how she had\
devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health--and how\
nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\
gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven\
years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\
Isabella\'92s marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\
dearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\
as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\
all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\
peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\
hers--one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\
such an affection for her as could never find fault.\
\
How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was going\
only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\
difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss\
Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and domestic,\
she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She\
dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her. He could not\
meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\
\
The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\
not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\
for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of\
mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\
everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\
temper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\
\
Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\
settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\
reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\
through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\
Isabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\
and give her pleasant society again.\
\
Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\
to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\
name, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses\
were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\
acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\
not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even\
half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over\
it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it\
necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous\
man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and\
hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the\
origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet\
reconciled to his own daughter\'92s marrying, nor could ever speak of her\
but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,\
when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his\
habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that\
other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much\
disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for\
them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the\
rest of her life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully\
as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was\
impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,\
\
\'93Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\
Mr. Weston ever thought of her!\'94\
\
\'93I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such\
a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves\
a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\
ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\
own?\'94\
\
\'93A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\
This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours, my\
dear.\'94\
\
\'93How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We\
shall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\
visit very soon.\'94\
\
\'93My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\
not walk half so far.\'94\
\
\'93No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\
to be sure.\'94\
\
\'93The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\
little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\
visit?\'94\
\
\'93They are to be put into Mr. Weston\'92s stable, papa. You know we have\
settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\
night. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\
to Randalls, because of his daughter\'92s being housemaid there. I only\
doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\
papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\
mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!\'94\
\
\'93I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\
have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\
sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\
girl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\
curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\
have had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\
of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\
excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\
to have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\
over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\
be able to tell her how we all are.\'94\
\
Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\
hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably\
through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own. The\
backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked\
in and made it unnecessary.\
\
Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\
only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\
connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella\'92s husband. He lived\
about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\
and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\
mutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\
some days\'92 absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\
well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated\
Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\
always did him good; and his many inquiries after \'93poor Isabella\'94 and\
her children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\
Woodhouse gratefully observed, \'93It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\
to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have\
had a shocking walk.\'94\
\
\'93Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\
must draw back from your great fire.\'94\
\
\'93But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\
catch cold.\'94\
\
\'93Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.\'94\
\
\'93Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\
here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\
breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.\'94\
\
\'93By the bye--I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\
sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\
congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\
all behave? Who cried most?\'94\
\
\'93Ah! poor Miss Taylor! \'91Tis a sad business.\'94\
\
\'93Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\
\'91poor Miss Taylor.\'92 I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\
comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it\
must be better to have only one to please than two.\'94\
\
\'93Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\
creature!\'94 said Emma playfully. \'93That is what you have in your head, I\
know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\'94\
\
\'93I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\'94 said Mr. Woodhouse, with a\
sigh. \'93I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\'94\
\
\'93My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\
Knightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\
myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--in a\
joke--it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\
in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\
though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew\
it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\
really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\
every body.\
\
\'93Emma knows I never flatter her,\'94 said Mr. Knightley, \'93but I meant no\
reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\
to please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be a\
gainer.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Emma, willing to let it pass--\'93you want to hear about\
the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\
charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not\
a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we\
were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every\
day.\'94\
\
\'93Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\'94 said her father. \'93But, Mr.\
Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\
sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\'94\
\
Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. \'93It\
is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\'94 said Mr.\
Knightley. \'93We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\
suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor\'92s\
advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor\'92s\
time of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\
her to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\
herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\
must be glad to have her so happily married.\'94\
\
\'93And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\'94 said Emma, \'93and a very\
considerable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you\
know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the\
right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may\
comfort me for any thing.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, \'93Ah!\
my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\
whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\
matches.\'94\
\
\'93I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for\
other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such\
success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\
again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\
seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\
either in his business in town or among his friends here, always\
acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--Mr. Weston need not spend\
a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\
Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\
promise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\
uncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\
subject, but I believed none of it.\
\
\'93Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I met\
with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\
away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\
Farmer Mitchell\'92s, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match\
from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance,\
dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.\'94\
\
\'93I do not understand what you mean by \'91success,\'92\'94 said Mr. Knightley.\
\'93Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\
spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\
about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady\'92s mind! But\
if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means\
only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, \'91I think it\
would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry\
her,\'92 and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why\
do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You\
made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be said.\'94\
\
\'93And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--I\
pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\
never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my\
poor word \'91success,\'92 which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\
entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\
but I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing and\
the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston\'92s visits here, and given\
many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\
not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\
enough to comprehend that.\'94\
\
\'93A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\
unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\
own concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\
good to them, by interference.\'94\
\
\'93Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\'94 rejoined\
Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. \'93But, my dear, pray do not\
make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one\'92s family\
circle grievously.\'94\
\
\'93Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\
Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\
Highbury who deserves him--and he has been here a whole year, and has\
fitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him\
single any longer--and I thought when he was joining their hands to-day,\
he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office\
done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I\
have of doing him a service.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young\
man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew him any\
attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. That will\
be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to\
meet him.\'94\
\
\'93With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\'94 said Mr. Knightley,\
laughing, \'93and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\
thing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\
and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\
man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER II\
\
\
Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,\
which for the last two or three generations had been rising into\
gentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on\
succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\
for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\
and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering\
into the militia of his county, then embodied.\
\
Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\
military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire\
family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized,\
except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were\
full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.\
\
Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\
fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was\
not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\
infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with\
due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much\
happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a\
husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due\
to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\
but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\
resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother,\
but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother\'92s\
unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\
They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\
of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\
once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\
\
Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\
as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\
the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years\'92 marriage, he\
was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.\
From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy\
had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\
mother\'92s, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\
Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature\
of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the\
little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some reluctance\
the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were\
overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and\
the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek,\
and his own situation to improve as he could.\
\
A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\
engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\
London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\
brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\
where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation\
and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his\
life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy\
competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining\
Highbury, which he had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as\
portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of\
his own friendly and social disposition.\
\
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\
schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth,\
it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\
purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\
but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\
accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\
his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\
probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\
never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\
even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\
a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\
pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\
chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\
\
He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\
for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\
uncle\'92s heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\
the name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore,\
that he should ever want his father\'92s assistance. His father had no\
apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her\
husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston\'92s nature to imagine that\
any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he\
believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, and\
was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man\
had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked on as\
sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a\
kind of common concern.\
\
Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively\
curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little\
returned that he had never been there in his life. His coming to visit\
his father had been often talked of but never achieved.\
\
Now, upon his father\'92s marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a\
most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a\
dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with\
Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now\
was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope\
strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new\
mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury\
included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.\
\'93I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill\
has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter,\
indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and\
he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.\'94\
\
It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course,\
formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing\
attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most\
welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation\
which her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most\
fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate\
she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial\
separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and\
who could ill bear to part with her.\
\
She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think, without\
pain, of Emma\'92s losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour\'92s ennui,\
from the want of her companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble\
character; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would\
have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped\
would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and\
privations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of\
Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking,\
and in Mr. Weston\'92s disposition and circumstances, which would make the\
approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in\
the week together.\
\
Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\
Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more\
than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\
that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\
at his being still able to pity \'91poor Miss Taylor,\'92 when they left her\
at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\
in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\
own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse\'92s giving a gentle sigh,\
and saying, \'93Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.\'94\
\
There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to\
pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\
The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\
being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\
had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach\
could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\
different from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit\
for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them\
from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\
earnestly tried to prevent any body\'92s eating it. He had been at the\
pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry\
was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one\
of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse\'92s life; and upon being applied to, he\
could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\
of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\
many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\
opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\
every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\
and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\
\
There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\
seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston\'92s wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.\
Woodhouse would never believe it.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER III\
\
\
Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\
have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\
his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\
his house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his\
own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\
intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\
hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance but\
such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him, Highbury,\
including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish\
adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not\
unfrequently, through Emma\'92s persuasion, he had some of the chosen and\
the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he preferred;\
and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there\
was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a\
card-table for him.\
\
Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by\
Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\
of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the\
elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse\'92s drawing-room, and the smiles\
of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\
\
After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\
Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\
the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\
carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\
either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\
would have been a grievance.\
\
Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\
lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\
single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\
regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\
circumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\
of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\
Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\
much of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\
make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\
outward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\
youth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted\
to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small\
income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and a woman\
whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal good-will\
and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved every body,\
was interested in every body\'92s happiness, quicksighted to every body\'92s\
merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with\
blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours\
and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and\
cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful spirit, were a\
recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She was\
a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse,\
full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\
\
Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an\
establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of\
refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,\
upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous\
pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real,\
honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of\
accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might\
be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little\
education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard\'92s\
school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was\
reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden,\
gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great\
deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own\
hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked\
after her to church. She was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who\
had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the\
occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr.\
Woodhouse\'92s kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat\
parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose\
a few sixpences by his fireside.\
\
These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to\
collect; and happy was she, for her father\'92s sake, in the power; though,\
as far as she was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of\
Mrs. Weston. She was delighted to see her father look comfortable, and\
very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the\
quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so\
spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.\
\
As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the\
present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most\
respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her; a most\
welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew\
very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of\
her beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no\
longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.\
\
Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed\
her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard\'92s school, and somebody\
had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of\
parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her history.\
She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and\
was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young\
ladies who had been at school there with her.\
\
She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort\
which Emma particularly admired. She was short, plump, and fair, with a\
fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great\
sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased\
with her manners as her person, and quite determined to continue the\
acquaintance.\
\
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith\'92s\
conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not\
inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,\
shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly\
grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed\
by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had\
been used to, that she must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.\
Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those\
natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury\
and its connexions. The acquaintance she had already formed were\
unworthy of her. The friends from whom she had just parted, though very\
good sort of people, must be doing her harm. They were a family of the\
name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large\
farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very\
creditably, she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of\
them--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the\
intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance\
to be quite perfect. _She_ would notice her; she would improve her; she\
would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her into good\
society; she would form her opinions and her manners. It would be an\
interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her\
own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.\
\
She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and\
listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the\
evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which\
always closed such parties, and for which she had been used to sit and\
watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the\
fire, before she was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse\
of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every\
thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted\
with its own ideas, did she then do all the honours of the meal, and\
help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an\
urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil\
scruples of their guests.\
\
Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse\'92s feelings were in sad warfare.\
He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his\
youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him\
rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would\
have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health\
made him grieve that they would eat.\
\
Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could,\
with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain\
himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to\
say:\
\
\'93Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg\
boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg\
better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body\
else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see--one of\
our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a\
_little_ bit of tart--a _very_ little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You\
need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the\
custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to _half_ a glass of wine? A\
_small_ half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could\
disagree with you.\'94\
\
Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a much\
more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular\
pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was\
quite equal to her intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage\
in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much\
panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with\
highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss\
Woodhouse had treated her all the evening, and actually shaken hands\
with her at last!\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IV\
\
\
Harriet Smith\'92s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick\
and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and\
telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so\
did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had\
very early foreseen how useful she might find her. In that respect\
Mrs. Weston\'92s loss had been important. Her father never went beyond the\
shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long\
walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston\'92s marriage\
her exercise had been too much confined. She had ventured once alone to\
Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore,\
one whom she could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable\
addition to her privileges. But in every respect, as she saw more of\
her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her kind designs.\
\
Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\
disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\
guided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself\
was very amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\
appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no\
want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\
Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith\'92s being exactly the\
young friend she wanted--exactly the something which her home required.\
Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\
never be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\
sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the\
object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet\
would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there\
was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.\
\
Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who\
were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She was ready to tell\
every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma\
was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never believe that in\
the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth. Harriet\
had no penetration. She had been satisfied to hear and believe just what\
Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her; and looked no farther.\
\
Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of\
the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the\
conversation--and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of\
Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied\
her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,\
and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe\
the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her\
talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings,\
and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much\
exultation of Mrs. Martin\'92s having \'93_two_ parlours, two very good\
parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard\'92s\
drawing-room; and of her having an upper maid who had lived\
five-and-twenty years with her; and of their having eight cows, two of\
them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch\
cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin\'92s saying as she was so fond of it,\
it should be called _her_ cow; and of their having a very handsome\
summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to\
drink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen\
people.\'94\
\
For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate\
cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings\
arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and\
daughter, a son and son\'92s wife, who all lived together; but when it\
appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was\
always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing\
something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs.\
Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little\
friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not\
taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.\
\
With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number and\
meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,\
and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to\
speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening\
games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured and\
obliging. He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her\
some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them, and in\
every thing else he was so very obliging. He had his shepherd\'92s son into\
the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her. She was very fond\
of singing. He could sing a little himself. She believed he was very\
clever, and understood every thing. He had a very fine flock, and, while\
she was with them, he had been bid more for his wool than any body in\
the country. She believed every body spoke well of him. His mother and\
sisters were very fond of him. Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and\
there was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body\
to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married, he\
would make a good husband. Not that she _wanted_ him to marry. She was\
in no hurry at all.\
\
\'93Well done, Mrs. Martin!\'94 thought Emma. \'93You know what you are about.\'94\
\
\'93And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send\
Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever\
seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\
teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\
her.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\
his own business? He does not read?\'94\
\
\'93Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read a\
good deal--but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\
Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window\
seats--but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an evening,\
before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of the\
Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the Vicar of\
Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of\
the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but\
he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can.\'94\
\
The next question was--\
\
\'93What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\
first, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\
after a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now and\
then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston.\
He has passed you very often.\'94\
\
\'93That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\
any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\
is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\
precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do.\
A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me;\
I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other. But\
a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as\
much above my notice as in every other he is below it.\'94\
\
\'93To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him;\
but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.\'94\
\
\'93I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\
indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\
his age to be?\'94\
\
\'93He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\
23rd just a fortnight and a day\'92s difference--which is very odd.\'94\
\
\'93Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\
perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they\
are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably\
repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young\
woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very\
desirable.\'94\
\
\'93Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\'94\
\
\'93Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not\
born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely\
to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he\
might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family\
property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and\
so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in\
time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing\
yet.\'94\
\
\'93To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\
indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\
of taking a boy another year.\'94\
\
\'93I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\
marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his\
sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\
to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\
to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\
careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a\
gentleman\'92s daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by\
every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who\
would take pleasure in degrading you.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield,\
and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any\
body can do.\'94\
\
\'93You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would\
have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent\
even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently\
well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd\
acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still\
be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn\
in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife,\
who will probably be some mere farmer\'92s daughter, without education.\'94\
\
\'93To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\
but what had had some education--and been very well brought up. However,\
I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours--and I am sure I shall\
not wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\
regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\
sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\
if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not\
visit her, if I can help it.\'94\
\
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\
alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but\
she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious\
difficulty, on Harriet\'92s side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her\
own.\
\
They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\
Donwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\
her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\
not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\
yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\
sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\
neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\
other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen,\
she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet\'92s\
inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\
noticed her father\'92s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\
Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\
\
They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\
kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\
and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\
compose.\
\
\'93Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was quite\
a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\
think we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\
most days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\
He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it,\
but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well,\
Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think of him?\
Do you think him so very plain?\'94\
\
\'93He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothing\
compared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\
much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\
very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\
degree or two nearer gentility.\'94\
\
\'93To be sure,\'94 said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \'93he is not so genteel\
as real gentlemen.\'94\
\
\'93I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\
repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\
must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield,\
you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I\
should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company\
with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior\
creature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him\
at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not\
you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and\
abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly\
unmodulated as I stood here.\'94\
\
\'93Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air and\
way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But\
Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Knightley\'92s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\
compare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\
_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\
only gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\
and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\
manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent.\
You must see the difference.\'94\
\
\'93Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old\
man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\'94\
\
\'93Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\
grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\
be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\
awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\
age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\
Weston\'92s time of life?\'94\
\
\'93There is no saying, indeed,\'94 replied Harriet rather solemnly.\
\
\'93But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\
vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\
nothing but profit and loss.\'94\
\
\'93Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.\'94\
\
\'93How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\
circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\
He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\
else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\
do with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\
rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\
_us_.\'94\
\
\'93I wonder he did not remember the book\'94--was all Harriet\'92s answer, and\
spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\
safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\
next beginning was,\
\
\'93In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton\'92s manners are superior to Mr.\
Knightley\'92s or Mr. Weston\'92s. They have more gentleness. They might be\
more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\
almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\
because there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do to\
be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley\'92s downright, decided, commanding\
sort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\
and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set\
about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think\
a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a\
model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.\
He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\
whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\
Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\
softer than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to please\
you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?\'94\
\
She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr.\
Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and\
said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\
\
Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\
farmer out of Harriet\'92s head. She thought it would be an excellent\
match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\
to have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\
else must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\
body should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\
entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet\'92s coming to\
Hartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense\
of its expediency. Mr. Elton\'92s situation was most suitable, quite the\
gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\
any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\
He had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\
income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\
to have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\
as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\
deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\
\
She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\
girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\
foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet\'92s there could be little\
doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\
weight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\
young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned very\
handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\
there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense\
with:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin\'92s riding\
about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by\
Mr. Elton\'92s admiration.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER V\
\
\
\'93I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,\'94 said Mr.\
Knightley, \'93of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I\
think it a bad thing.\'94\
\
\'93A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?\'94\
\
\'93I think they will neither of them do the other any good.\'94\
\
\'93You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her with a\
new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been\
seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently\
we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good! This will\
certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr.\
Knightley.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing\
Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks\
exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday,\
and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a\
girl in Highbury for her to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not\
allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live\
alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no\
man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of\
one of her own sex, after being used to it all her life. I can imagine\
your objection to Harriet Smith. She is not the superior young woman\
which Emma\'92s friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants\
to see her better informed, it will be an inducement to her to read more\
herself. They will read together. She means it, I know.\'94\
\
\'93Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old.\
I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times of\
books that she meant to read regularly through--and very good lists\
they were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes\
alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew\
up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\
credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\
out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\
steady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing\
requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\
understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\
affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her\
to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.\'94\
\
\'93I dare say,\'94 replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \'93that I thought so\
_then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma\'92s omitting\
to do any thing I wished.\'94\
\
\'93There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,\'94--said\
Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. \'93But I,\'94\
 he soon added, \'93who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\
still see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\
of her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able to\
answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was always\
quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she\
was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her\
mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits her\
mother\'92s talents, and must have been under subjection to her.\'94\
\
\'93I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\
recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse\'92s family and wanted another\
situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\
any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said he, smiling. \'93You are better placed _here_; very fit for a\
wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to\
be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\
not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\
promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on the\
very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing\
as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I\
should certainly have named Miss Taylor.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\
such a man as Mr. Weston.\'94\
\
\'93Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that\
with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We\
will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of\
comfort, or his son may plague him.\'94\
\
\'93I hope not _that_.--It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not\
foretell vexation from that quarter.\'94\
\
\'93Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma\'92s\
genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the\
young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But\
Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\
very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\
nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\
flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\
Her ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\
thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\
inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_ cannot\
gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of conceit\
with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just refined\
enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances\
have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma\'92s doctrines give any\
strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally\
to the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little\
polish.\'94\
\
\'93I either depend more upon Emma\'92s good sense than you do, or am more\
anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\
How well she looked last night!\'94\
\
\'93Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very\
well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma\'92s being pretty.\'94\
\
\'93Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\
beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?\'94\
\
\'93I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\
seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial\
old friend.\'94\
\
\'93Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,\
open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\
and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\
There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\
glance. One hears sometimes of a child being \'91the picture of health;\'92\
now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\
grown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\'94\
\
\'93I have not a fault to find with her person,\'94 he replied. \'93I think her\
all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\
that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\
she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\
another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\
Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.\'94\
\
\'93And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\
doing them any harm. With all dear Emma\'92s little faults, she is an\
excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\
sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\
trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\
lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\
times.\'94\
\
\'93Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and\
I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella.\
John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection,\
and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not quite\
frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions\
with me.\'94\
\
\'93I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\
but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\
you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma\'92s\
mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\
possible good can arise from Harriet Smith\'92s intimacy being made a\
matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any\
little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be\
expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly\
approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a\
source of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to\
give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little\
remains of office.\'94\
\
\'93Not at all,\'94 cried he; \'93I am much obliged to you for it. It is very\
good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often\
found; for it shall be attended to.\'94\
\
\'93Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about\
her sister.\'94\
\
\'93Be satisfied,\'94 said he, \'93I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my\
ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella\
does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest;\
perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one\
feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her!\'94\
\
\'93So do I,\'94 said Mrs. Weston gently, \'93very much.\'94\
\
\'93She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just\
nothing at all. But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she\
cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love\
with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some\
doubt of a return; it would do her good. But there is nobody hereabouts\
to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home.\'94\
\
\'93There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution\
at present,\'94 said Mrs. Weston, \'93as can well be; and while she is so\
happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which\
would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse\'92s account. I\
do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight\
to the state, I assure you.\'94\
\
Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own\
and Mr. Weston\'92s on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes\
at Randalls respecting Emma\'92s destiny, but it was not desirable to\
have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon\
afterwards made to \'93What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have\
rain?\'94 convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about\
Hartfield.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VI\
\
\
Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet\'92s fancy a proper\
direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good\
purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr.\
Elton\'92s being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners;\
and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his\
admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating\
as much liking on Harriet\'92s side, as there could be any occasion for.\
She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton\'92s being in the fairest way of\
falling in love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regard\
to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could\
not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His\
perception of the striking improvement of Harriet\'92s manner, since her\
introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of\
his growing attachment.\
\
\'93You have given Miss Smith all that she required,\'94 said he; \'93you have\
made her graceful and easy. She was a beautiful creature when she\
came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are\
infinitely superior to what she received from nature.\'94\
\
\'93I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted\
drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She had all the\
natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have\
done very little.\'94\
\
\'93If it were admissible to contradict a lady,\'94 said the gallant Mr.\
Elton--\
\
\'93I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have\
taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded\
decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!\'94\
\
\'93Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition\
more truly amiable.\'94\
\
\'93I have no doubt of it.\'94 And it was spoken with a sort of sighing\
animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She was not less pleased\
another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers,\
to have Harriet\'92s picture.\
\
\'93Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?\'94 said she: \'93did you\
ever sit for your picture?\'94\
\
Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,\
with a very interesting naivete,\
\
\'93Oh! dear, no, never.\'94\
\
No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,\
\
\'93What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would\
give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.\
You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great\
passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and\
was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or\
another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture,\
if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her\
picture!\'94\
\
\'93Let me entreat you,\'94 cried Mr. Elton; \'93it would indeed be a delight!\
Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent\
in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could\
you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your\
landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable\
figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?\'94\
\
Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking\
likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don\'92t pretend to be in raptures\
about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet\'92s face. \'93Well, if you give me\
such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do.\
Harriet\'92s features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult;\
and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines\
about the mouth which one ought to catch.\'94\
\
\'93Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have\
not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,\
it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.\'94\
\
\'93But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks\
so little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of answering\
me? How completely it meant, \'91why should my picture be drawn?\'92\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still\
I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\'94\
\
Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\
and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\
earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly,\
and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at\
portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might\
decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many beginnings were\
displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and\
water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to do\
every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than\
many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to.\
She played and sang;--and drew in almost every style; but steadiness\
had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of\
excellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to\
have failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either\
as an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others\
deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often\
higher than it deserved.\
\
There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the\
most; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there\
been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions\
would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness\
pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse\'92s performances must be capital.\
\
\'93No great variety of faces for you,\'94 said Emma. \'93I had only my own\
family to study from. There is my father--another of my father--but the\
idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\
take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\
again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\
kindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\
There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!--and\
the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\
would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw\
her four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\
attempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry and\
John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\
them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\
drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\
or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\
any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\
coarser featured than any of mama\'92s children ever were. Here is my\
sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\
the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\
wish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That\'92s very\
like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very\
good. Then here is my last,\'94--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman\
in small size, whole-length--\'93my last and my best--my brother, Mr. John\
Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away\
in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not\
help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made\
a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in\
thinking it _very_ like)--only too handsome--too flattering--but\
that was a fault on the right side\'94--after all this, came poor dear\
Isabella\'92s cold approbation of--\'93Yes, it was a little like--but to be\
sure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble\
in persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\
altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\
it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\
morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then\
forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet\'92s sake, or rather\
for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\
_present_, I will break my resolution now.\'94\
\
Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was\
repeating, \'93No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\
you observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,\'94 with so interesting a\
consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\
leave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\
declaration must wait a little longer.\
\
She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be\
a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley\'92s, and was\
destined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable station\
over the mantelpiece.\
\
The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\
keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\
youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\
doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\
touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\
and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\
it, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\
to employ him in reading.\
\
\'93If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\
indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen the\
irksomeness of Miss Smith\'92s.\'94\
\
Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\
She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less\
would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready at the\
smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress,\
and be charmed.--There was no being displeased with such an encourager,\
for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it\
was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and his\
complaisance were unexceptionable.\
\
The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\
pleased with the first day\'92s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\
of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\
to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\
height, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of\
its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling\
its destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the\
beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both;\
with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton\'92s very promising\
attachment was likely to add.\
\
Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,\
entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.\
\
\'93By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the\
party.\'94\
\
The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,\
took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the\
picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased,\
but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every\
criticism.\
\
\'93Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she\
wanted,\'94--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting that\
she was addressing a lover.--\'93The expression of the eye is most correct,\
but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of\
her face that she has them not.\'94\
\
\'93Do you think so?\'94 replied he. \'93I cannot agree with you. It appears\
to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\
likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.\'94\
\
\'93You have made her too tall, Emma,\'94 said Mr. Knightley.\
\
Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly\
added,\
\
\'93Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she\
is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which in short\
gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\
Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\
such a height as Miss Smith\'92s. Exactly so indeed!\'94\
\
\'93It is very pretty,\'94 said Mr. Woodhouse. \'93So prettily done! Just as your\
drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well\
as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems\
to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\
shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold.\'94\
\
\'93But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\
Look at the tree.\'94\
\
\'93But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\'94\
\
\'93You, sir, may say any thing,\'94 cried Mr. Elton, \'93but I must confess that\
I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of\
doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other\
situation would have been much less in character. The naivete of Miss\
Smith\'92s manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep\
my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.\'94\
\
The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few\
difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the\
order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste\
could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,\
must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse\
could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of\
December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it\
was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert. \'93Might he be trusted\
with the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing\
it! he could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how\
much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.\'94\
\
\'93He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!--she would not give\
him such a troublesome office for the world,\'94--brought on the desired\
repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled\
the business.\
\
Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\
the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\
safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of\
not being incommoded enough.\
\
\'93What a precious deposit!\'94 said he with a tender sigh, as he received\
it.\
\
\'93This man is almost too gallant to be in love,\'94 thought Emma. \'93I should\
say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\
being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\
exactly; it will be an \'91Exactly so,\'92 as he says himself; but he does\
sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\
endure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\
But it is his gratitude on Harriet\'92s account.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VII\
\
\
The very day of Mr. Elton\'92s going to London produced a fresh occasion\
for Emma\'92s services towards her friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,\
as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to\
return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been\
talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something\
extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell. Half a\
minute brought it all out. She had heard, as soon as she got back to\
Mrs. Goddard\'92s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and\
finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a\
little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away; and on\
opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two songs which\
she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was\
from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.\
\'93Who could have thought it? She was so surprized she did not know what\
to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter,\
at least she thought so. And he wrote as if he really loved her very\
much--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast as she could to\
ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--\'94 Emma was half-ashamed of her\
friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.\
\
\'93Upon my word,\'94 she cried, \'93the young man is determined not to lose any\
thing for want of asking. He will connect himself well if he can.\'94\
\
\'93Will you read the letter?\'94 cried Harriet. \'93Pray do. I\'92d rather you\
would.\'94\
\
Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She read, and was surprized. The style\
of the letter was much above her expectation. There were not merely no\
grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a\
gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and\
the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer. It was\
short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety,\
even delicacy of feeling. She paused over it, while Harriet stood\
anxiously watching for her opinion, with a \'93Well, well,\'94 and was at last\
forced to add, \'93Is it a good letter? or is it too short?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, indeed, a very good letter,\'94 replied Emma rather slowly--\'93so\
good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his\
sisters must have helped him. I can hardly imagine the young man whom\
I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if\
left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;\
no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a\
woman. No doubt he is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural\
talent for--thinks strongly and clearly--and when he takes a pen in\
hand, his thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men.\
Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments\
to a certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet\
(returning it,) than I had expected.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said the still waiting Harriet;--\'93well--and--and what shall I\
do?\'94\
\
\'93What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this\
letter?\'94\
\
\'93Yes.\'94\
\
\'93But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and\
speedily.\'94\
\
\'93Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.\'94\
\
\'93Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express\
yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your not\
being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be\
unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude\
and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will\
present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind, I am persuaded. You need\
not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his\
disappointment.\'94\
\
\'93You think I ought to refuse him then,\'94 said Harriet, looking down.\
\
\'93Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any\
doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been\
under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel\
in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer. I had imagined you were\
consulting me only as to the wording of it.\'94\
\
Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:\
\
\'93You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.\'94\
\
\'93No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would you\
advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do.\'94\
\
\'93I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do\
with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.\'94\
\
\'93I had no notion that he liked me so very much,\'94 said Harriet,\
contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her\
silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that\
letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,\
\
\'93I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman _doubts_ as\
to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse\
him. If she can hesitate as to \'91Yes,\'92 she ought to say \'91No\'92 directly.\
It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with\
half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself,\
to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influence\
you.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would\
just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As\
you say, one\'92s mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be\
hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say \'91No,\'92\
perhaps.--Do you think I had better say \'91No?\'92\'94\
\
\'93Not for the world,\'94 said Emma, smiling graciously, \'93would I advise you\
either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you\
prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him the most\
agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you\
hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at\
this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive\
yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this\
moment whom are you thinking of?\'94\
\
The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned away\
confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was\
still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.\
Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes. At\
last, with some hesitation, Harriet said--\
\
\'93Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well\
as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost\
made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?\'94\
\
\'93Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just\
what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to\
myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation\
in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would\
have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the\
consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest\
degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence;\
but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could not have\
visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you\
for ever.\'94\
\
Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her\
forcibly.\
\
\'93You could not have visited me!\'94 she cried, looking aghast. \'93No, to be\
sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have\
been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not\
give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing\
in the world.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it\
must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.\
I must have given you up.\'94\
\
\'93Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me\
never to come to Hartfield any more!\'94\
\
\'93Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_\
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I\
wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He must\
have a pretty good opinion of himself.\'94\
\
\'93I do not think he is conceited either, in general,\'94 said Harriet, her\
conscience opposing such censure; \'93at least, he is very good natured,\
and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard\
for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, though\
he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly I must\
confess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comes\
to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,\
_one_ is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.\
Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and\
his being so much attached to me--and his writing such a letter--but as\
to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be\
parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\
because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\'94\
\
\'93Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.\'94\
\
Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a \'93very\
true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\
manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\
her husband could write a good letter.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\
happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him. But\
how shall I do? What shall I say?\'94\
\
Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised\
its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her\
assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance\
being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.\
The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had such a\
softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her up\
with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much concerned at\
the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of what his mother\
and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not\
fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come in\
her way at that moment, he would have been accepted after all.\
\
This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\
was finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\
Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by\
speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of\
Mr. Elton.\
\
\'93I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\'94 was said in rather a\
sorrowful tone.\
\
\'93Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\
are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.\'94\
\
\'93And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but\
at Hartfield.\'94\
\
Some time afterwards it was, \'93I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\
surprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would--for\
Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\
linen-draper.\'94\
\
\'93One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher\
of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\
opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\
valuable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\
is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\
among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I\
are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\
themselves.\'94\
\
Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\
people should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\
cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\
the rejected Mr. Martin.\
\
\'93Now he has got my letter,\'94 said she softly. \'93I wonder what they are all\
doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy, they will be unhappy\
too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.\'94\
\
\'93Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\
employed,\'94 cried Emma. \'93At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\
your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\
is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\
allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\'94\
\
\'93My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\'94\
\
\'93Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\
Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\
just before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\
evening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\
it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\
pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\
prepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\
their imaginations all are!\'94\
\
Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VIII\
\
\
Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she had been\
spending more than half her time there, and gradually getting to have\
a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every\
respect, safest and kindest, to keep her with them as much as possible\
just at present. She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or\
two to Mrs. Goddard\'92s, but it was then to be settled that she should\
return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.\
\
While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr.\
Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his\
mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it, and was\
induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his\
own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley,\
who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering by his short,\
decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and\
civil hesitations of the other.\
\
\'93Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not\
consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma\'92s advice and\
go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had\
better take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony,\
Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people.\'94\
\
\'93My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me.\'94\
\
\'93I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to\
entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my\
three turns--my winter walk.\'94\
\
\'93You cannot do better, sir.\'94\
\
\'93I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a\
very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you\
have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think\
the sooner _you_ go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the\
garden door for you.\'94\
\
Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being\
immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more\
chat. He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her with more\
voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.\
\
\'93I cannot rate her beauty as you do,\'94 said he; \'93but she is a\
pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her\
disposition. Her character depends upon those she is with; but in good\
hands she will turn out a valuable woman.\'94\
\
\'93I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be\
wanting.\'94\
\
\'93Come,\'94 said he, \'93you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you\
that you have improved her. You have cured her of her school-girl\'92s\
giggle; she really does you credit.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been\
of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they\
may. _You_ do not often overpower me with it.\'94\
\
\'93You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?\'94\
\
\'93Almost every moment. She has been gone longer already than she\
intended.\'94\
\
\'93Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps.\'94\
\
\'93Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!\'94\
\
\'93Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would.\'94\
\
Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said\
nothing. He presently added, with a smile,\
\
\'93I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that\
I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of\
something to her advantage.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed! how so? of what sort?\'94\
\
\'93A very serious sort, I assure you;\'94 still smiling.\
\
\'93Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love with her?\
Who makes you their confidant?\'94\
\
Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton\'92s having dropt a hint.\
Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew Mr.\
Elton looked up to him.\
\
\'93I have reason to think,\'94 he replied, \'93that Harriet Smith will soon have\
an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert\
Martin is the man. Her visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have\
done his business. He is desperately in love and means to marry her.\'94\
\
\'93He is very obliging,\'94 said Emma; \'93but is he sure that Harriet means to\
marry him?\'94\
\
\'93Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\
the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows\
I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\
considers me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether\
I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether\
I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\
altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\
(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\
above him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\
better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\
purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\
thing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\
the event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son and\
brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to me\
that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\
could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\
him away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\
would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\
thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\
the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow\
much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not appear\
to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs.\
Goddard\'92s to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without thinking\
him at all a tiresome wretch.\'94\
\
\'93Pray, Mr. Knightley,\'94 said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\
through a great part of this speech, \'93how do you know that Mr. Martin\
did not speak yesterday?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly,\'94 replied he, surprized, \'93I do not absolutely know it; but it\
may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?\'94\
\
\'93Come,\'94 said she, \'93I will tell you something, in return for what\
you have told me. He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was\
refused.\'94\
\
This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\
Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he stood\
up, in tall indignation, and said,\
\
\'93Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\
foolish girl about?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! to be sure,\'94 cried Emma, \'93it is always incomprehensible to a man\
that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\
imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\'94\
\
\'93Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\
meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\
so; but I hope you are mistaken.\'94\
\
\'93I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer.\'94\
\
\'93You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\
doing. You persuaded her to refuse him.\'94\
\
\'93And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\
feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\
but I cannot admit him to be Harriet\'92s equal; and am rather surprized\
indeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\
does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\
got over.\'94\
\
\'93Not Harriet\'92s equal!\'94 exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\
with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \'93No, he is\
not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\
situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\
Harriet Smith\'92s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\
connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\
nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\
certainly no respectable relations. She is known only as parlour-boarder\
at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any\
information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and\
too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she can have\
no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have\
any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and\
that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his account,\
as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him. I felt that,\
as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that as\
to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse. But I\
could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there\
being no harm in her, to her having that sort of disposition, which, in\
good hands, like his, might be easily led aright and turn out very well.\
The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side; and had not the\
smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out\
upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of.\
It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend\'92s\
leaving Highbury, for the sake of her being settled so well. I remember\
saying to myself, \'91Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will\
think this a good match.\'92\'94\
\
\'93I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any\
such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all his\
merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend!\
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom\
I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should\
think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are\
very different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are\
not just to Harriet\'92s claims. They would be estimated very differently\
by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two,\
but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in\
which she moves is much above his.--It would be a degradation.\'94\
\
\'93A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\
respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\'94\
\
\'93As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\
be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\
for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\
whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\
is a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her allowance is\
very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\
comfort.--That she is a gentleman\'92s daughter, is indubitable to me; that\
she associates with gentlemen\'92s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\
deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\'94\
\
\'93Whoever might be her parents,\'94 said Mr. Knightley, \'93whoever may have\
had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\
their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. After\
receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs. Goddard\'92s\
hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard\'92s line,\
to have Mrs. Goddard\'92s acquaintance. Her friends evidently thought\
this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough. She desired nothing\
better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a friend, her mind had\
no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She was as\
happy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She had no sense of\
superiority then. If she has it now, you have given it. You have been no\
friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded\
so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to\
him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling to address any\
woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he is\
the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he had\
encouragement.\'94\
\
It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\
assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\
again.\
\
\'93You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,\
are unjust to Harriet. Harriet\'92s claims to marry well are not so\
contemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\
has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her\
understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and\
supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and good-natured,\
let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them, they are not\
trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a\
beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an\
hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the\
subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall\
in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with\
such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought\
after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a\
claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim,\
comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and\
manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to\
be pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in\
general would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims\
a woman could possess.\'94\
\
\'93Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\
enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply\
it as you do.\'94\
\
\'93To be sure!\'94 cried she playfully. \'93I know _that_ is the feeling of\
you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every\
man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\
judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to\
marry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just\
entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\
because she does not accept the first offer she receives? No--pray let\
her have time to look about her.\'94\
\
\'93I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\'94 said Mr. Knightley\
presently, \'93though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive\
that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her up\
with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a claim to, that,\
in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good enough for her.\
Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing\
so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. Miss\
Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though\
she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to\
say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of\
connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent\
men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be\
involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. Let\
her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for\
ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her\
to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large\
fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard\'92s all the rest\
of her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry\
somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the\
old writing-master\'92s son.\'94\
\
\'93We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there\
can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more\
angry. But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin, it is impossible;\
she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any\
second application. She must abide by the evil of having refused him,\
whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to\
say that I might not influence her a little; but I assure you there\
was very little for me or for any body to do. His appearance is so much\
against him, and his manner so bad, that if she ever were disposed to\
favour him, she is not now. I can imagine, that before she had seen\
any body superior, she might tolerate him. He was the brother of her\
friends, and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen\
nobody better (that must have been his great assistant) she might not,\
while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable. But the case\
is altered now. She knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a\
gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet.\'94\
\
\'93Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!\'94 cried Mr.\
Knightley.--\'93Robert Martin\'92s manners have sense, sincerity, and\
good-humour to recommend them; and his mind has more true gentility than\
Harriet Smith could understand.\'94\
\
Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was\
really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone. She\
did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\
judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\
but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\
which made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\
sitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\
Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\
on Emma\'92s side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\
thinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\
\
\'93Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I hope it\
will not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\
to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it\
is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;--and as\
a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\
will be all labour in vain.\'94\
\
Emma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\
\
\'93Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\
and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\
an imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\
body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\
as well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet\'92s.\
He knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\
wherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\
moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\
not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\
animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\
intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.\'94\
\
\'93I am very much obliged to you,\'94 said Emma, laughing again. \'93If I had\
set my heart on Mr. Elton\'92s marrying Harriet, it would have been very\
kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\
myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\
equal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.\'94\
\
\'93Good morning to you,\'94--said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\
very much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\
mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he had\
given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair,\
was provoking him exceedingly.\
\
Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\
indistinctness in the causes of her\'92s, than in his. She did not always\
feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\
her opinions were right and her adversary\'92s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He\
walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\
was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\
the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet\'92s staying\
away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility of the\
young man\'92s coming to Mrs. Goddard\'92s that morning, and meeting with\
Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\
of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\
Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any\
such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\
settled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\
Knightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which woman\'92s\
friendship and woman\'92s feelings would not justify.\
\
He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\
that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\
with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of\
Mr. Knightley\'92s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such\
a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger, she\
was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished resentfully\
to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly might have\
heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done, and\
Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to\
money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise\
to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the\
influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr.\
Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its\
effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming\
any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and\
more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very sure\
did not belong to Mr. Elton.\
\
Harriet\'92s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\
to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\
telling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\
delight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard\'92s to attend a sick child,\
and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\
coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\
found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road\
to London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\
whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\
Perry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\
was in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to\
persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\
do; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\
_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\
not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a\
very enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\
precious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very sure\
there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton\
only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.\
Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more about\
Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her, \'93that she did\
not pretend to understand what his business might be, but she only\
knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should think the\
luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his\
equal for beauty or agreeableness.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IX\
\
\
Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel with\
herself. He was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before\
he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave looks\
shewed that she was not forgiven. She was sorry, but could not repent.\
On the contrary, her plans and proceedings were more and more justified\
and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days.\
\
The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr.\
Elton\'92s return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common\
sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences\
of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet\'92s feelings, they were\
visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as\
her youth and sort of mind admitted. Emma was soon perfectly satisfied\
of Mr. Martin\'92s being no otherwise remembered, than as he furnished a\
contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.\
\
Her views of improving her little friend\'92s mind, by a great deal of\
useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few\
first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow. It was much\
easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her imagination\
range and work at Harriet\'92s fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge\
her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary\
pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she\
was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing\
all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with, into a thin\
quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her friend, and ornamented with\
ciphers and trophies.\
\
In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are\
not uncommon. Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard\'92s, had written out\
at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it\
from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse\'92s help, to get a great many more.\
Emma assisted with her invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote\
a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first\
order, in form as well as quantity.\
\
Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the\
girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting\
in. \'93So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young--he\
wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time.\'94\
 And it always ended in \'93Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\'94\
\
His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,\
did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he\
had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much,\
something, he thought, might come from that quarter.\
\
It was by no means his daughter\'92s wish that the intellects of Highbury\
in general should be put under requisition. Mr. Elton was the only one\
whose assistance she asked. He was invited to contribute any really good\
enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he might recollect; and she had\
the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections;\
and at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that\
nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the\
sex should pass his lips. They owed to him their two or three politest\
puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled, and\
rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,\
\
    My first doth affliction denote,\
      Which my second is destin\'92d to feel\
    And my whole is the best antidote\
      That affliction to soften and heal.--\
\
made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some\
pages ago already.\
\
\'93Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?\'94 said she; \'93that\
is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to\
you.\'94\
\
\'93Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind in his\
life. The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse\'94--he\
stopt a moment--\'93or Miss Smith could inspire him.\'94\
\
The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. He\
called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table\
containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had addressed\
to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his\
manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.\
\
\'93I do not offer it for Miss Smith\'92s collection,\'94 said he. \'93Being my\
friend\'92s, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye,\
but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.\'94\
\
The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could\
understand. There was deep consciousness about him, and he found\
it easier to meet her eye than her friend\'92s. He was gone the next\
moment:--after another moment\'92s pause,\
\
\'93Take it,\'94 said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards\
Harriet--\'93it is for you. Take your own.\'94\
\
But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never\
loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.\
\
        To Miss--\
\
          CHARADE.\
\
    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\
      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\
    Another view of man, my second brings,\
      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\
\
    But ah! united, what reverse we have!\
      Man\'92s boasted power and freedom, all are flown;\
    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\
      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\
\
      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,\
      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\
\
She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through\
again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then\
passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while\
Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and\
dulness, \'93Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed. I have read worse\
charades. _Courtship_--a very good hint. I give you credit for it. This\
is feeling your way. This is saying very plainly--\'91Pray, Miss Smith,\
give me leave to pay my addresses to you. Approve my charade and my\
intentions in the same glance.\'92\
\
      May its approval beam in that soft eye!\
\
Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets, the\
justest that could be given.\
\
      Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.\
\
Humph--Harriet\'92s ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in\
love, indeed, to describe her so. Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the\
benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life\
you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken. An excellent charade\
indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon\
now.\'94\
\
She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,\
which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the\
eagerness of Harriet\'92s wondering questions.\
\
\'93What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I\
cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find\
it out, Miss Woodhouse. Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it\
kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young lady.\
Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?\
\
      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\
\
Can it be Neptune?\
\
      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\
\
Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one\
syllable. It must be very clever, or he would not have brought it. Oh!\
Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?\'94\
\
\'93Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking\
of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made by a friend\
upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.\
\
For Miss ------, read Miss Smith.\
\
    My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,\
      Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.\
\
That is _court_.\
\
    Another view of man, my second brings;\
      Behold him there, the monarch of the seas!\
\
That is _ship_;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.\
\
    But ah! united, (_courtship_, you know,) what reverse we have!\
      Man\'92s boasted power and freedom, all are flown.\
    Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,\
      And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.\
\
A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application, which\
I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty in\
comprehending. Read it in comfort to yourself. There can be no doubt of\
its being written for you and to you.\'94\
\
Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion. She read\
the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness. She could not\
speak. But she was not wanted to speak. It was enough for her to feel.\
Emma spoke for her.\
\
\'93There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,\'94\
 said she, \'93that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton\'92s intentions. You\
are his object--and you will soon receive the completest proof of it. I\
thought it must be so. I thought I could not be so deceived; but now, it\
is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided, as my wishes on\
the subject have been ever since I knew you. Yes, Harriet, just so long\
have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened.\
I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were\
most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have\
really so equalled each other! I am very happy. I congratulate you, my\
dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may\
well feel pride in creating. This is a connexion which offers nothing\
but good. It will give you every thing that you want--consideration,\
independence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your\
real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy\
for ever. This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in\
either of us.\'94\
\
\'93Dear Miss Woodhouse!\'94--and \'93Dear Miss Woodhouse,\'94 was all that Harriet,\
with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they did\
arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently clear to\
her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered just as she\
ought. Mr. Elton\'92s superiority had very ample acknowledgment.\
\
\'93Whatever you say is always right,\'94 cried Harriet, \'93and therefore I\
suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could not\
have imagined it. It is so much beyond any thing I deserve. Mr. Elton,\
who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions about _him_. He\
is so very superior. Only think of those sweet verses--\'91To Miss ------.\'92\
Dear me, how clever!--Could it really be meant for me?\'94\
\
\'93I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that. It is a\
certainty. Receive it on my judgment. It is a sort of prologue to\
the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon followed by\
matter-of-fact prose.\'94\
\
\'93It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected. I am sure,\
a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do take\
place!\'94\
\
\'93When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and\
really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is so\
evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement of\
other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper form.\
You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong to one\
another by every circumstance of your respective homes. Your marrying\
will be equal to the match at Randalls. There does seem to be a\
something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right\
direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.\
\
      The course of true love never did run smooth--\
\
A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that\
passage.\'94\
\
\'93That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,\
who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he, the very\
handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body looks up to,\
quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after, that every body\
says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it;\
that he has more invitations than there are days in the week. And so\
excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has\
ever preached from since he came to Highbury. Dear me! When I look back\
to the first time I saw him! How little did I think!--The two Abbots and\
I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\
was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\
through herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me\
look too, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\
looked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\'94\
\
\'93This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be, must\
be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\
are not to be addressing our conduct to fools. If they are anxious to\
see you _happily_ married, here is a man whose amiable character gives\
every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same\
country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will\
be accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the\
common phrase, be _well_ married, here is the comfortable fortune, the\
respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy\
them.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You understand\
every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the other. This\
charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have made any\
thing like it.\'94\
\
\'93I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\
yesterday.\'94\
\
\'93I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\'94\
\
\'93I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\'94\
\
\'93It is as long again as almost all we have had before.\'94\
\
\'93I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such things\
in general cannot be too short.\'94\
\
Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\
comparisons were rising in her mind.\
\
\'93It is one thing,\'94 said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--\'93to have\
very good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\
any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\
must, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\
this.\'94\
\
Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin\'92s\
prose.\
\
\'93Such sweet lines!\'94 continued Harriet--\'93these two last!--But how shall I\
ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?--Oh! Miss\
Woodhouse, what can we do about that?\'94\
\
\'93Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\
say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\
pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your soft eyes shall\
chuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\
charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.\'94\
\
\'93Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should not\
write it into your book.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! but those two lines are\'94--\
\
--\'93The best of all. Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private\
enjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\
because you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\
meaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\
very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend upon\
it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better than his\
passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or\
neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be\
no possible reflection on you.\'94\
\
Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,\
so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\
declaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\
of publicity.\
\
\'93I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\'94 said she.\
\
\'93Very well,\'94 replied Emma; \'93a most natural feeling; and the longer it\
lasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\
will not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\
so much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\
thing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\
gallantry towards us all!--You must let me read it to him.\'94\
\
Harriet looked grave.\
\
\'93My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You\
will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\
quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\
which may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\
tribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\
have left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\
than towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\
encouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\
this charade.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.\'94\
\
Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\
recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \'93Well, my dears, how does\
your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\
piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt, we suppose,\
by a fairy)--containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\
it in.\'94\
\
She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\
distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\
part as she proceeded--and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\
foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\
\
\'93Aye, that\'92s very just, indeed, that\'92s very properly said. Very true.\
\'91Woman, lovely woman.\'92 It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I\
can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so\
prettily, but you, Emma.\'94\
\
Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very\
tender sigh, he added,\
\
\'93Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\
was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\
remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have\
heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\
several.\
\
    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,\
      Kindled a flame I yet deplore,\
    The hood-wink\'92d boy I called to aid,\
    Though of his near approach afraid,\
      So fatal to my suit before.\
\
And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever all\
the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\
Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick\'92s, you know.\'94\
\
\'93Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.\
\
    Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.\
\
The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\
christened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\
next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her--and what\
room there will be for the children?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\
has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, you\
know. Why should there be any change?\'94\
\
\'93I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not\
since last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley\'92s\
being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly taken\
away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see\
Miss Taylor here!\'94\
\
\'93She will not be surprized, papa, at least.\'94\
\
\'93I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\
first heard she was going to be married.\'94\
\
\'93We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\
here.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she\
is coming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.\'94\
\
\'93It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case of\
necessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\
ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\
they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken\
out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim this\
Christmas--though you know it is longer since they were with him, than\
with us.\'94\
\
\'93It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\
anywhere but at Hartfield.\'94\
\
Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley\'92s claims on his\
brother, or any body\'92s claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat musing\
a little while, and then said,\
\
\'93But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\
soon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\
stay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I\
do not think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\
husband.\'94\
\
This was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\
could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\
by the idea of his daughter\'92s attachment to her husband, she immediately\
led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\
\
\'93Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother\
and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the children.\
We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder which she\
will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\'94\
\
\'93Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\
to come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\'94\
\
\'93I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.\'94\
\
\'93Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\
eldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\
is named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\
the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\
thought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\
are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\
come and stand by my chair, and say, \'91Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\
of string?\'92 and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\
were only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\
them very often.\'94\
\
\'93He appears rough to you,\'94 said Emma, \'93because you are so very gentle\
yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\
think him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if\
they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\
affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\
father. The children are all fond of him.\'94\
\
\'93And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\
very frightful way!\'94\
\
\'93But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\
enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\
their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I cannot understand it.\'94\
\
\'93That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\
understand the pleasures of the other.\'94\
\
Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate\
in preparation for the regular four o\'92clock dinner, the hero of this\
inimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\
receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\
his the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die;\
and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\
reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse\'92s party could be made\
up in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\
degree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give\
way; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\
dining with him--had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\
conditionally to come.\
\
Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\
on their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged--she\
re-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\
paper from the table, she returned it--\
\
\'93Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank\
you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have ventured\
to write it into Miss Smith\'92s collection. Your friend will not take it\
amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight\
lines.\'94\
\
Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked rather\
doubtingly--rather confused; said something about \'93honour,\'94--glanced at\
Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took\
it up, and examined it very attentively. With the view of passing off an\
awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\
\
\'93You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade\
must not be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman\'92s\
approbation while he writes with such gallantry.\'94\
\
\'93I have no hesitation in saying,\'94 replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\
a good deal while he spoke; \'93I have no hesitation in saying--at least\
if my friend feels at all as _I_ do--I have not the smallest doubt that,\
could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at the\
book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as the\
proudest moment of his life.\'94\
\
After this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\
it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was\
a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\
laugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and\
the sublime of pleasure to Harriet\'92s share.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER X\
\
\
Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\
prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\
morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\
lived a little way out of Highbury.\
\
Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\
leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of\
the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr.\
Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about\
a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not\
very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\
no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\
present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\
of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\
eyes.--Emma\'92s remark was--\
\
\'93There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\
days.\'94--Harriet\'92s was--\
\
\'93Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow\
curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\'94\
\
\'93I do not often walk this way _now_,\'94 said Emma, as they proceeded, \'93but\
_then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately\
acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part\
of Highbury.\'94\
\
Harriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage,\
and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors\
and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with\
Mr. Elton\'92s seeing ready wit in her.\
\
\'93I wish we could contrive it,\'94 said she; \'93but I cannot think of any\
tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire\
about of his housekeeper--no message from my father.\'94\
\
She pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some\
minutes, Harriet thus began again--\
\
\'93I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\
going to be married! so charming as you are!\'94--\
\
Emma laughed, and replied,\
\
\'93My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\
I must find other people charming--one other person at least. And I\
am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\
intention of ever marrying at all.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.\'94\
\
\'93I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\
tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\
question: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather not\
be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I\
must expect to repent it.\'94\
\
\'93Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\'94--\
\
\'93I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\
in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been in\
love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.\
And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\
situation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\
consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\
mistress of their husband\'92s house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never\
could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and\
always right in any man\'92s eyes as I am in my father\'92s.\'94\
\
\'93But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\'94\
\
\'93That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if\
I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--so\
smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--and so apt\
to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\
to-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\
likeness, except in being unmarried.\'94\
\
\'93But still, you will be an old maid! and that\'92s so dreadful!\'94\
\
\'93Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\
only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\
woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old\
maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good\
fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant\
as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much against the\
candour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very\
narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.\
Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and\
generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross. This\
does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good natured and\
too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very much to the taste\
of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty certainly has not\
contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had only a shilling in the\
world, she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody\
is afraid of her: that is a great charm.\'94\
\
\'93Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\
grow old?\'94\
\
\'93If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\
many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\
in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman\'92s\
usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\
are now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\
more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\
objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\
great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\
to be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\
children of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be enough\
of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that\
declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and every\
fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it\
suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder. My\
nephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.\'94\
\
\'93Do you know Miss Bates\'92s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\
a hundred times--but are you acquainted?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\
Highbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\
with a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\
half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\
Fairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter from\
her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go round\
and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a\
stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears of\
nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires\
me to death.\'94\
\
They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\
superseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\
were as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\
counsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\
could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\
expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\
done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\
always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\
the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\
came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\
comfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\
the scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\
\
\'93These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\
every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\
these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\
soon it may all vanish from my mind?\'94\
\
\'93Very true,\'94 said Harriet. \'93Poor creatures! one can think of nothing\
else.\'94\
\
\'93And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\'94 said\
Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\
the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\
into the lane again. \'93I do not think it will,\'94 stopping to look once\
more at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\
greater within.\
\
\'93Oh! dear, no,\'94 said her companion.\
\
They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\
passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\
time only to say farther,\
\
\'93Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\
thoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion\
has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that\
is truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can\
for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.\'94\
\
Harriet could just answer, \'93Oh! dear, yes,\'94 before the gentleman joined\
them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the\
first subject on meeting. He had been going to call on them. His visit\
he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about\
what could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\
accompany them.\
\
\'93To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\'94 thought Emma;\
\'93to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase\
of love on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\
declaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.\'94\
\
Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\
afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\
side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\
not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet\'92s habits of\
dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\
they would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\
stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\
of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\
footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\
follow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\
she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the comfort\
of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from the\
cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to fetch\
broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk to\
and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would have\
been the most natural, had she been acting just then without design;\
and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without\
any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\
involuntarily: the child\'92s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow;\
and she was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in\
a conversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\
animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\
having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back\
a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join\
them.\
\
Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\
and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only\
giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday\'92s party at his\
friend Cole\'92s, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese,\
the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the\
dessert.\
\
\'93This would soon have led to something better, of course,\'94 was her\
consoling reflection; \'93any thing interests between those who love; and\
any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\
could but have kept longer away!\'94\
\
They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\
pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\
house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, and\
fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off short,\
and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to\
entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to\
rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\
\
\'93Part of my lace is gone,\'94 said she, \'93and I do not know how I am to\
contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\
hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop\
at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string,\
or any thing just to keep my boot on.\'94\
\
Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\
exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and\
endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they were\
taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind\
it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between\
them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive\
her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged to leave\
the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton\
should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but\
by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make\
it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining\
room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It could be\
protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and make her\
appearance.\
\
The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\
favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having\
schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to the point.\
He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that\
he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little\
gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.\
\
\'93Cautious, very cautious,\'94 thought Emma; \'93he advances inch by inch, and\
will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\'94\
\
Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\
ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\
the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them\
forward to the great event.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XI\
\
\
Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma\'92s power\
to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures. The coming of her\
sister\'92s family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation,\
and then in reality, it became henceforth her prime object of interest;\
and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be\
expected--she did not herself expect--that any thing beyond occasional,\
fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers. They might\
advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or\
other whether they would or no. She hardly wished to have more leisure\
for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they\
will do for themselves.\
\
Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent\
from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.\
Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been\
divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of\
this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was\
therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their\
Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be\
induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella\'92s sake; and\
who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in\
forestalling this too short visit.\
\
He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a little\
of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some\
of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms were needless;\
the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John\
Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids,\
all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival,\
the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed\
and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could\
not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even\
for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father\
were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal\
solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones, and for their\
having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and\
drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for,\
without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long\
a disturbance to him, either in themselves or in any restless attendance\
on them.\
\
Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet\
manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt\
up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly\
attached to her father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a\
warmer love might have seemed impossible. She could never see a fault\
in any of them. She was not a woman of strong understanding or any\
quickness; and with this resemblance of her father, she inherited also\
much of his constitution; was delicate in her own health, over-careful\
of that of her children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond\
of her own Mr. Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.\
They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong\
habit of regard for every old acquaintance.\
\
Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;\
rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his private\
character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally\
pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He was not an\
ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a\
reproach; but his temper was not his great perfection; and, indeed, with\
such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects\
in it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her temper\
must hurt his. He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she\
wanted, and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.\
\
He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong\
in him escaped her. She was quick in feeling the little injuries to\
Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she might have\
passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella\'92s sister,\
but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without\
praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal\
compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of\
all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into, the want of respectful\
forbearance towards her father. There he had not always the patience\
that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse\'92s peculiarities and\
fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or\
sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John\
Knightley had really a great regard for his father-in-law, and generally\
a strong sense of what was due to him; but it was too often for Emma\'92s\
charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently\
to be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of\
every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of\
necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.\
They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a\
melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter\'92s attention\
to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.\
\
\'93Ah, my dear,\'94 said he, \'93poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business.\'94\
\
\'93Oh yes, sir,\'94 cried she with ready sympathy, \'93how you must miss her!\
And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so\
grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without\
her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she is pretty well, sir.\'94\
\
\'93Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the\
place agrees with her tolerably.\'94\
\
Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts\
of the air of Randalls.\
\
\'93Oh! no--none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my\
life--never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his own regret.\'94\
\
\'93Very much to the honour of both,\'94 was the handsome reply.\
\
\'93And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?\'94 asked Isabella in the\
plaintive tone which just suited her father.\
\
Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--\'93Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they\
married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one,\
have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both,\
either at Randalls or here--and as you may suppose, Isabella, most\
frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston\
is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way,\
you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be\
aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be\
assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by\
any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact\
truth.\'94\
\
\'93Just as it should be,\'94 said Mr. John Knightley, \'93and just as I hoped\
it was from your letters. Her wish of shewing you attention could not be\
doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I\
have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change\
being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have\
Emma\'92s account, I hope you will be satisfied.\'94\
\
\'93Why, to be sure,\'94 said Mr. Woodhouse--\'93yes, certainly--I cannot\
deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\
often--but then--she is always obliged to go away again.\'94\
\
\'93It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--You quite\
forget poor Mr. Weston.\'94\
\
\'93I think, indeed,\'94 said John Knightley pleasantly, \'93that Mr. Weston has\
some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the\
poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims\
of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella,\
she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all\
the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\'94\
\
\'93Me, my love,\'94 cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--\
\'93Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\
greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\
the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss\
Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting\
Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does\
not deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever\
existed. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal\
for temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry\'92s kite for him that\
very windy day last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last\
September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o\'92clock at night,\
on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I\
have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better\
man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.\'94\
\
\'93Where is the young man?\'94 said John Knightley. \'93Has he been here on this\
occasion--or has he not?\'94\
\
\'93He has not been here yet,\'94 replied Emma. \'93There was a strong\
expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\
nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\'94\
\
\'93But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\'94 said her father.\
\'93He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\
proper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\
well done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\
cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--\'94\
\
\'93My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\'94\
\
\'93Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought\
it--and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well,\
time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was an\
exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal\
of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\
28th--and began, \'91My dear Madam,\'92 but I forget how it went on; and it\
was signed \'91F. C. Weston Churchill.\'92--I remember that perfectly.\'94\
\
\'93How very pleasing and proper of him!\'94 cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\
Knightley. \'93I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\
how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\
something so shocking in a child\'92s being taken away from his parents and\
natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with\
him. To give up one\'92s child! I really never could think well of any body\
who proposed such a thing to any body else.\'94\
\
\'93Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\'94 observed Mr.\
John Knightley coolly. \'93But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt\
what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather\
an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he takes\
things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other,\
depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his\
comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing\
whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection,\
or any thing that home affords.\'94\
\
Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had\
half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She\
would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and\
valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to\
himself, whence resulted her brother\'92s disposition to look down on\
the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was\
important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XII\
\
\
Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination of\
Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\
Isabella\'92s first day. Emma\'92s sense of right however had decided it;\
and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\
particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement\
between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\
invitation.\
\
She hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time\
to make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been\
in the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be\
out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had\
ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of\
friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the children\
with her--the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who\
was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced\
about in her aunt\'92s arms. It did assist; for though he began with grave\
looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in\
the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all the\
unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again;\
and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then\
a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the\
baby,\
\
\'93What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.\
As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with\
regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\'94\
\
\'93If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women,\
and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with\
them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always\
think alike.\'94\
\
\'93To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the\
wrong.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said he, smiling--\'93and reason good. I was sixteen years old when\
you were born.\'94\
\
\'93A material difference then,\'94 she replied--\'93and no doubt you were much\
my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the\
lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\
nearer?\'94\
\
\'93Yes--a good deal _nearer_.\'94\
\
\'93But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\
think differently.\'94\
\
\'93I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years\'92 experience, and by\
not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\
let us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little\
Emma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old\
grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.\'94\
\
\'93That\'92s true,\'94 she cried--\'93very true. Little Emma, grow up a better\
woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\
Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\
intentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects on\
my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know that\
Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.\'94\
\
\'93A man cannot be more so,\'94 was his short, full answer.\
\
\'93Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.\'94\
\
This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley\
made his appearance, and \'93How d\'92ye do, George?\'94 and \'93John, how are\
you?\'94 succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that\
seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led\
either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the\
other.\
\
The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards\
entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and\
the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\
daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\
distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining in\
one or the other.\
\
The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally\
of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\
and who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had generally\
some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious\
anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at\
Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to\
give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting\
to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his\
life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a drain, the change\
of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for\
wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality\
of interest by John, as his cooler manners rendered possible; and if his\
willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries\
even approached a tone of eagerness.\
\
While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\
full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\
\
\'93My poor dear Isabella,\'94 said he, fondly taking her hand, and\
interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\
five children--\'93How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\
And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\
my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You and\
I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all\
have a little gruel.\'94\
\
Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both the\
Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and\
two basins only were ordered. After a little more discourse in praise of\
gruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every\
body, he proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection,\
\
\'93It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\
End instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we should not\
have gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for\
the weakness in little Bella\'92s throat,--both sea air and bathing.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\
good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\
perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\
to any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.\'94\
\
\'93Come, come,\'94 cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, \'93I must\
beg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;--I\
who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear\
Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and\
he never forgets you.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?\'94\
\
\'93Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he has\
not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has not time to take\
care of himself--which is very sad--but he is always wanted all round\
the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere. But\
then there is not so clever a man any where.\'94\
\
\'93And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?\
I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He\
will be so pleased to see my little ones.\'94\
\
\'93I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\
him about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,\
you had better let him look at little Bella\'92s throat.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\
uneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\
her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\
Wingfield\'92s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.\'94\
\
\'93It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\
to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\
spoken to--\
\
\'93You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\'94 said Emma, \'93I\
have not heard one inquiry after them.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you mention\
them in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\
Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.--They\
are always so pleased to see my children.--And that excellent Miss\
Bates!--such thorough worthy people!--How are they, sir?\'94\
\
\'93Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a\
bad cold about a month ago.\'94\
\
\'93How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\
this autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\
general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.\'94\
\
\'93That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\
mention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\
as he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\
altogether a sickly season.\'94\
\
\'93No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\
except--\
\
\'93Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always\
a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\
dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--and the\
air so bad!\'94\
\
\'93No, indeed--_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\
very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London\
in general, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\
different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\
unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there is\
hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in:\
but _we_ are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of\
Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it--but\
after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\
creatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I think\
you are any of you looking well at present.\'94\
\
\'93I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\
little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\
free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\
rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\
little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\
coming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\
assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\
sent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that\
you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\'94 turning her eyes with\
affectionate anxiety towards her husband.\
\
\'93Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\
very far from looking well.\'94\
\
\'93What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?\'94 cried Mr. John\
Knightley, hearing his own name.\
\
\'93I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\
well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\
wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you\
left home.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Isabella,\'94--exclaimed he hastily--\'93pray do not concern yourself\
about my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\
the children, and let me look as I chuse.\'94\
\
\'93I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\'94\
 cried Emma, \'93about your friend Mr. Graham\'92s intending to have a bailiff\
from Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\
not the old prejudice be too strong?\'94\
\
And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced to\
give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\
worse to hear than Isabella\'92s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\
Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\
moment very happy to assist in praising.\
\
\'93That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\'94 said Mrs. John Knightley.--\'93It\
is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\
accidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\
grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\
regret excessively on dear Emma\'92s account that she cannot be more at\
Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\
Campbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\
delightful companion for Emma.\'94\
\
Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\
\
\'93Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\
kind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\
better companion than Harriet.\'94\
\
\'93I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\
very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma\'92s age.\'94\
\
This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\
moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\
close without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\
a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--undoubting\
decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty\
severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\
tolerably;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\
had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\
her own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\
had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\
gruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\
it, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\
dangerous opening.\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\
with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma\'92s ear expressed, \'93Ah!\
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\
does not bear talking of.\'94 And for a little while she hoped he would not\
talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to\
the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some minutes,\
however, he began with,\
\
\'93I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\
instead of coming here.\'94\
\
\'93But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children a\
great deal of good.\'94\
\
\'93And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\
to South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\
hear you had fixed upon South End.\'94\
\
\'93I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\
a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there, never\
found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\
entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\
be depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and\
his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.\'94\
\
\'93You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--Perry\
was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\
sea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And, by\
what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\
the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable. You should have\
consulted Perry.\'94\
\
\'93But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how\
great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\
should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\
chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,\
better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into\
a worse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\
ill-judged measure.\'94\
\
Emma\'92s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he\
had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\
brother-in-law\'92s breaking out.\
\
\'93Mr. Perry,\'94 said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, \'93would do\
as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\
any business of his, to wonder at what I do?--at my taking my family to\
one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\
my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--I want his directions no more than\
his drugs.\'94 He paused--and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\
sarcastic dryness, \'93If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\
five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\
expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\
willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.\'94\
\
\'93True, true,\'94 cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--\'93very\
true. That\'92s a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what I was telling\
you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\
right that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\
any difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\
inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\
the present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\
will be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\
morning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me\
your opinion.\'94\
\
Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\
friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\
attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--but the soothing\
attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and\
the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the\
other, prevented any renewal of it.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIII\
\
\
There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John\
Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning\
among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking over what\
she had done every evening with her father and sister. She had nothing\
to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a\
delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.\
\
In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their\
mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too,\
there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no\
denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was\
persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of\
the party.\
\
How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty if he\
could, but as his son and daughter\'92s carriage and horses were actually\
at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than a simple question on\
that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long\
to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for\
Harriet also.\
\
Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the\
only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, as\
well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse\'92s habits and inclination being\
consulted in every thing.\
\
The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that\
Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent\
by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with\
a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs.\
Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma called\
on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to\
Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard\
was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet\
herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her\
from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss\
without many tears.\
\
Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard\'92s\
unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr.\
Elton\'92s would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last\
tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most\
comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had not\
advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard\'92s door, when she was met by Mr.\
Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly\
together in conversation about the invalid--of whom he, on the rumour\
of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might\
carry some report of her to Hartfield--they were overtaken by Mr. John\
Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest\
boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country\
run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice\
pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and\
proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend\'92s\
complaint;--\'93a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\
about her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\
Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\
alarmed her with them.\'94 Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\
he exclaimed,\
\
\'93A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid\
infectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\
yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\
Why does not Perry see her?\'94\
\
Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\
excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard\'92s experience and\
care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\
could not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\
than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject,\
\
\'93It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much like\
snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\
should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father from\
venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel the\
cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great\
a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton,\
in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me a\
little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\
what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\
common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.\'94\
\
Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\
which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\
care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her\'92s,\
he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma,\
too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him\
impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied with\
his muttering acknowledgment of its being \'93very cold, certainly very\
cold,\'94 and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls,\
and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour\
of the evening.\
\
\'93You do quite right,\'94 said she;--\'93we will make your apologies to Mr. and\
Mrs. Weston.\'94\
\
But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly\
offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton\'92s only\
objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt\
satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had\
his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment;\
never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes more exulting than when\
he next looked at her.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said she to herself, \'93this is most strange!--After I had got\
him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill\
behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe, in many men,\
especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining\
out--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures,\
their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any\
thing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most\
valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love\
with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine\
out wherever he is asked. What a strange thing love is! he can see ready\
wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her.\'94\
\
Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him\
the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his\
manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his voice while\
assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard\'92s for news of her fair\
friend, the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting\
her again, when he hoped to be able to give a better report; and\
he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of\
approbation much in his favour.\
\
After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began\
with--\
\
\'93I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr.\
Elton. It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\
men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to please,\
every feature works.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Elton\'92s manners are not perfect,\'94 replied Emma; \'93but where there is\
a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great\
deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he will\
have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect\
good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, \'93he seems\
to have a great deal of good-will towards you.\'94\
\
\'93Me!\'94 she replied with a smile of astonishment, \'93are you imagining me to\
be Mr. Elton\'92s object?\'94\
\
\'93Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\
occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!\'94\
\
\'93I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it\
is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\
manners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\
look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.\'94\
\
\'93I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and\
I are very good friends, and nothing more;\'94 and she walked on, amusing\
herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\
partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high\
pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well\
pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and in\
want of counsel. He said no more.\
\
Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\
spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking\
from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest\
daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the\
weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own\
going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was\
cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe;\
and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow\
were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so\
overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world\
in a very short time.\
\
Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\
preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\
his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\
which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\
nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\
whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\
discontent.\
\
\'93A man,\'94 said he, \'93must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks\
people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\
this, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\
agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\
absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--The folly of not allowing\
people to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people\'92s not staying\
comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such\
an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\
should deem it;--and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\
than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\
the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\
or his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\
that he can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\
another man\'92s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\
and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\
Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses and\
four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\
creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\
at home.\'94\
\
Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no\
doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the \'93Very true,\
my love,\'94 which must have been usually administered by his travelling\
companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making\
any answer at all. She could not be complying, she dreaded being\
quarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\
talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\
her lips.\
\
They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton,\
spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with\
pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and\
cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed, that she\
began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from\
what had reached her. She had sent while dressing, and the answer had\
been, \'93Much the same--not better.\'94\
\
\'93_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard\'92s,\'94 said she presently, \'93was not so\
pleasant as I had hoped--\'91Not better\'92 was _my_ answer.\'94\
\
His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\
sentiment as he answered.\
\
\'93Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that\
when I called at Mrs. Goddard\'92s door, which I did the very last thing\
before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\
by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned--I\
had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I\
knew had been given her in the morning.\'94\
\
Emma smiled and answered--\'93My visit was of use to the nervous part of\
her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;\
it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\
probably heard.\'94\
\
\'93Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--\'94\
\
\'93He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\
morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\
impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!\'94\
\
\'93Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment.\'94\
\
This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\
estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\
when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\
and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\
\
\'93What an excellent device,\'94 said he, \'93the use of a sheepskin for\
carriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold\
with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\
rendered a gentleman\'92s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\
and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\
unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\
cold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha!\
snows a little I see.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said John Knightley, \'93and I think we shall have a good deal of\
it.\'94\
\
\'93Christmas weather,\'94 observed Mr. Elton. \'93Quite seasonable; and\
extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\
yesterday, and prevent this day\'92s party, which it might very possibly\
have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\
much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\
the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites\
their friends about them, and people think little of even the worst\
weather. I was snowed up at a friend\'92s house once for a week. Nothing\
could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away\
till that very day se\'92nnight.\'94\
\
Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\
said only, coolly,\
\
\'93I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\'94\
\
At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much\
astonished now at Mr. Elton\'92s spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed\
quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.\
\
\'93We are sure of excellent fires,\'94 continued he, \'93and every thing in the\
greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--Mrs. Weston\
indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so\
hospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but where\
small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.\
Mr. Weston\'92s dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably;\
and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by\
two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with\
a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,\
though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of\
London, may not quite enter into our feelings.\'94\
\
\'93I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine with\
any body.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had\
been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will\
be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great\
enjoyment.\'94\
\
\'93My first enjoyment,\'94 replied John Knightley, as they passed through the\
sweep-gate, \'93will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIV\
\
\
Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they\
walked into Mrs. Weston\'92s drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose his\
joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his ill-humour. Mr.\
Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the\
place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as\
happy as she was. To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons.\
Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the\
world to whom she spoke with such unreserve, as to his wife; not any\
one, to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and\
understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the\
little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father\
and herself. She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston\
had not a lively concern; and half an hour\'92s uninterrupted communication\
of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life\
depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.\
\
This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day\'92s visit might not\
afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the\
very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice was grateful\
to Emma, and she determined to think as little as possible of Mr.\
Elton\'92s oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that\
was enjoyable to the utmost.\
\
The misfortune of Harriet\'92s cold had been pretty well gone through\
before her arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough\
to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own and\
Isabella\'92s coming, and of Emma\'92s being to follow, and had indeed just\
got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his\
daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost\
wholly engrossed by her attentions to him, was able to turn away and\
welcome her dear Emma.\
\
Emma\'92s project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather sorry\
to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was close to her.\
The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards\
Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat at her elbow, but\
was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice, and\
solicitously addressing her upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting\
him, his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal\
suggestion of \'93Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be\
possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from\
Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!\'94--Yet he would be so anxious\
for her being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her father,\
and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her\
drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly\
like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her to preserve her\
good manners. For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet\'92s,\
in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively\
civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on\
amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton\'92s\
nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to. She heard enough\
to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; she\
heard the words \'93my son,\'94 and \'93Frank,\'94 and \'93my son,\'94 repeated several\
times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected\
that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could\
quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving\
question from her would have been awkward.\
\
Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma\'92s resolution of never\
marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr.\
Frank Churchill, which always interested her. She had frequently\
thought--especially since his father\'92s marriage with Miss Taylor--that\
if she _were_ to marry, he was the very person to suit her in age,\
character and condition. He seemed by this connexion between the\
families, quite to belong to her. She could not but suppose it to be\
a match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs.\
Weston did think of it, she was very strongly persuaded; and though\
not meaning to be induced by him, or by any body else, to give up a\
situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could\
change it for, she had a great curiosity to see him, a decided intention\
of finding him pleasant, of being liked by him to a certain degree, and\
a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends\'92\
imaginations.\
\
With such sensations, Mr. Elton\'92s civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;\
but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very\
cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly\
pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the\
substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--for\
when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,\
at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares of\
hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to\
her,\
\
\'93We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see\
two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son--and\
then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me\
telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank.\
I had a letter from him this morning, and he will be with us within a\
fortnight.\'94\
\
Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to\
his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party\
quite complete.\
\
\'93He has been wanting to come to us,\'94 continued Mr. Weston, \'93ever since\
September: every letter has been full of it; but he cannot command his\
own time. He has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between\
ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.\
But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in\
January.\'94\
\
\'93What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so\
anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost as happy as\
yourself.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another put-off.\
She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do: but she does not\
know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is--(but this is\
quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other\
room. There are secrets in all families, you know)--The case is, that a\
party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and\
that Frank\'92s coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not\
put off, he cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family\
that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular\
dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in\
two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.\
I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing\
Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself:\
but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table)\
has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at\
Hartfield, that she cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been\
long in the practice of doing.\'94\
\
\'93I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,\'94 replied\
Emma; \'93but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he\
will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.\'94\
\
\'93Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at\
the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow myself\
to speak ill of her, on Frank\'92s account; for I do believe her to be very\
fond of him. I used to think she was not capable of being fond of\
any body, except herself: but she has always been kind to him (in her\
way--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing\
to be as she likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him,\
that he should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say\
it to any body else, she has no more heart than a stone to people in\
general; and the devil of a temper.\'94\
\
Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,\
very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--yet\
observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--\
Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very glad to be\
secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked\
of: \'93for I cannot depend upon his coming. I cannot be so sanguine as\
Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\
Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?\'94\
\
\'93Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\
Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.\'94\
\
\'93My Emma!\'94 replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \'93what is the certainty\
of caprice?\'94 Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\
before--\'93You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\
so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\
thinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt\'92s spirits and pleasure; in\
short, upon her temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on\
the truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\
woman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\'94 replied Isabella:\
\'93and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest\
compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must\
be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but\
it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she never had any\
children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!\'94\
\
Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have\
heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\
which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\
would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills\
from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\
imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\
present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\
followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after\
dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\
conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\
whom he was always comfortable.\
\
While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\
saying,\
\
\'93And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\
certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\
whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\'94\
\
\'93Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\
if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\
some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\
any reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on\
the Churchills\'92 to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They\
are jealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\
dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.\'94\
\
\'93He ought to come,\'94 said Emma. \'93If he could stay only a couple of days,\
he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man\'92s not having\
it in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall into\
bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she wants\
to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_\'91s being under such\
restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if he\
likes it.\'94\
\
\'93One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\
one decides upon what he can do,\'94 replied Mrs. Weston. \'93One ought to\
use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\
individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\
not be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and every\
thing gives way to her.\'94\
\
\'93But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite. Now,\
according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that\
while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she\
owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_,\
she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she owes\
nothing at all.\'94\
\
\'93My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\
a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\
I have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\
may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\
be.\'94\
\
Emma listened, and then coolly said, \'93I shall not be satisfied, unless\
he comes.\'94\
\
\'93He may have a great deal of influence on some points,\'94 continued Mrs.\
Weston, \'93and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\
beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of\
his coming away from them to visit us.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XV\
\
\
Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his\
tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three\
companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness of\
the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty and\
convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last\
the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in very\
good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emma\
were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and, with\
scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\
\
Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by\
the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\
improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\
making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\
friendly smiles.\
\
He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--her fair,\
lovely, amiable friend. \'93Did she know?--had she heard any thing about\
her, since their being at Randalls?--he felt much anxiety--he must\
confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.\'94\
 And in this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\
attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror\
of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\
\
But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he\
were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than on\
Harriet\'92s--more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\
that there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\
earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\
again, for the present--to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\
into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\
though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\
proper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\
about her. She was vexed. It did appear--there was no concealing\
it--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\
Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\
and she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs. Weston\
to implore her assistance, \'93Would not she give him her support?--would\
not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go\
to Mrs. Goddard\'92s till it were certain that Miss Smith\'92s disorder had\
no infection? He could not be satisfied without a promise--would not she\
give him her influence in procuring it?\'94\
\
\'93So scrupulous for others,\'94 he continued, \'93and yet so careless for\
herself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\
yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\
throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. Have not I\
some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.\'94\
\
Emma saw Mrs. Weston\'92s surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\
address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of\
first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked and\
offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.\
She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she thought\
must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a\
seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\
\
She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\
another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\
from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\
of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing\
fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\
Woodhouse:\
\
\'93This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,\
sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\
through a storm of snow.\'94\
\
Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\
had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\
and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston\
and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\
son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\
\
\'93I admired your resolution very much, sir,\'94 said he, \'93in venturing out\
in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.\
Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and\
I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two\'92s snow can\
hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is\
blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other\
at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight.\'94\
\
Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\
had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest\
it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\
hurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\
to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid they\
would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable, that\
he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\
good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\
calling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\
every body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\
consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\
\
\'93What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?\'94 was Mr.\
Woodhouse\'92s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some\
time. To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\
representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\
their having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\
\
His eldest daughter\'92s alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\
blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\
in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\
adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager\
to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls,\
while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible\
accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\
\
\'93You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\'94 said she; \'93I dare\
say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we\
do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all\
afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes,\
you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that\
gives me cold.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed!\'94 replied he. \'93Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\
extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\
does give you cold. Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home,\
I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.\'94\
\
Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\
Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\
not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\
and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\
left the room immediately after his brother\'92s first report of the snow,\
came back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to examine,\
and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their\
getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence. He\
had gone beyond the sweep--some way along the Highbury road--the snow\
was nowhere above half an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to\
whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the\
clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon\
over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there\
being nothing to apprehend.\
\
To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\
scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father\'92s account, who\
was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\
constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\
appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\
Randalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning\
home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay; and\
while the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley\
and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus--\
\
\'93Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?\'94\
\
\'93I am ready, if the others are.\'94\
\
\'93Shall I ring the bell?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, do.\'94\
\
And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more,\
and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own\
house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and\
happiness when this visit of hardship were over.\
\
The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such\
occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley and Mr.\
Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal\
of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the\
discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for. \'93He was\
afraid they should have a very bad drive. He was afraid poor Isabella\
would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.\
He did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together\
as they could;\'94 and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very\
slow and wait for the other carriage.\
\
Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\
did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\
so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\
carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\
and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive. It would not have been\
the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\
previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\
him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\
one. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\
been drinking too much of Mr. Weston\'92s good wine, and felt sure that he\
would want to be talking nonsense.\
\
To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\
immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\
the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had they\
passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she found her\
subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded, and Mr. Elton\
actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the precious\
opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known,\
hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him; but\
flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\
unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\
very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\
really was so. Without scruple--without apology--without much apparent\
diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\
_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\
it all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\
restrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\
be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\
the passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\
playful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\
replied,\
\
\'93I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\
yourself--you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall\
be happy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\'94\
\
\'93Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly\
mean!\'94--And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such\
boastful pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with\
quickness,\
\
\'93Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\
for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\
either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\
to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\'94\
\
But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\
all to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\
having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\
slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--but\
acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he\
resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\
favourable answer.\
\
As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\
inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\
replied,\
\
\'93It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\
too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\
express. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\
month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily\
habit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is an\
unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!\
Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object\
of such professions.\'94\
\
\'93Good Heaven!\'94 cried Mr. Elton, \'93what can be the meaning of this?--Miss\
Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\
existence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\
cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she\
has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\
sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse!\
who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\
honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\
you. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\
else. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\
been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You\
cannot really, seriously, doubt it. No!--(in an accent meant to be\
insinuating)--I am sure you have seen and understood me.\'94\
\
It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--which\
of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\
overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\
being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton\'92s sanguine state of mind, he\
tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed--\
\
\'93Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\
silence. It confesses that you have long understood me.\'94\
\
\'93No, sir,\'94 cried Emma, \'93it confesses no such thing. So far from having\
long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\
to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\
should have been giving way to any feelings--Nothing could be farther\
from my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--your pursuit of\
her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\
very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not\
your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged\
ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have\
never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you\
have never thought seriously of her?\'94\
\
\'93Never, madam,\'94 cried he, affronted in his turn: \'93never, I assure you.\
_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort of\
girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish\
her extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\
to--Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\
quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\
alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--No, madam, my\
visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I\
received--\'94\
\
\'93Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely\
mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\
friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\
acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\
ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\
have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\
probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\
are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\
trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.\'94\
\
He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\
supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\
deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\
for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\
there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\
awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\
little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\
turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,\
all at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\
syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\
night. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\
indescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to Hartfield.\
\
There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father, who\
had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage\
Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--and in\
strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed as\
if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr.\
John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all kindness and\
attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her\
father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin of\
gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the\
day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party,\
except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation; and\
it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the\
usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVI\
\
\
The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\
and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow\
of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every\
thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst\
of all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\
other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and\
she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in\
error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\
effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\
\
\'93If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have\
borne any thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me--but poor\
Harriet!\'94\
\
How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never\
thought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well as\
she could; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\
supposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\
have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\
misled.\
\
The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--and the\
charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they had\
seemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its \'93ready\
wit\'94--but then the \'93soft eyes\'94--in fact it suited neither; it was\
a jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\
thick-headed nonsense?\
\
Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\
herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\
error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\
that he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\
gentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\
till this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\
any thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet\'92s friend.\
\
To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\
subject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\
that those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\
had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given,\
the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\
indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\
character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It\
was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\
respects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\
proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\
concerned about the feelings of others.\
\
Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton\'92s wanting to pay his\
addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\
proposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\
and was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\
arrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was\
perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be\
cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language or\
manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could\
hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less\
allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him. He\
only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\
of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\
easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\
else with twenty, or with ten.\
\
But--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\
of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\
him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!--look down\
upon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\
him, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\
presumption in addressing her!--It was most provoking.\
\
Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\
inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\
such equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\
in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must\
know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\
Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that the\
Eltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\
inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\
to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\
other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\
Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had\
long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which\
Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as he\
could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him\
to notice but his situation and his civility.--But he had fancied her\
in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\
after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\
and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop\
and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\
obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\
motive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\
delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\
If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\
wonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\
hers.\
\
The first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\
wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\
was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what\
ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\
concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\
\
\'93Here have I,\'94 said she, \'93actually talked poor Harriet into being very\
much attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\
me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\
not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\
used to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not\
to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\
of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\
chance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\
opportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\
attempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\
I have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel this\
disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body\
else who would be at all desirable for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I\
could not endure William Coxe--a pert young lawyer.\'94\
\
She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more\
serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be,\
and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and\
all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of\
future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the\
acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding\
eclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some\
time longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the\
conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully.\
\
To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma\'92s, though under temporary\
gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of\
spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy,\
and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough\
to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of\
softened pain and brighter hope.\
\
Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone\
to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her, and to\
depend on getting tolerably out of it.\
\
It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in\
love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to\
disappoint him--that Harriet\'92s nature should not be of that superior\
sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--and that there\
could be no necessity for any body\'92s knowing what had passed except the\
three principals, and especially for her father\'92s being given a moment\'92s\
uneasiness about it.\
\
These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow\
on the ground did her further service, for any thing was welcome that\
might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.\
\
The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day, she\
could not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\
daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\
or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\
with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\
thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\
morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\
freeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No intercourse\
with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday any\
more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton\'92s\
absenting himself.\
\
It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though\
she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society\
or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with\
his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to\
hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from\
them,--\
\
\'93Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\'94\
\
These days of confinement would have been, but for her private\
perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\
her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to\
his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\
ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during the\
rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and obliging,\
and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of\
cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such\
an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as\
made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVII\
\
\
Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The\
weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr.\
Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter to stay\
behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole party\
set off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor\
Isabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with those she doated\
on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently\
busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.\
\
The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr.\
Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with\
Mr. Elton\'92s best compliments, \'93that he was proposing to leave Highbury\
the following morning in his way to Bath; where, in compliance with\
the pressing entreaties of some friends, he had engaged to spend a few\
weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he was under, from\
various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal\
leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he should ever\
retain a grateful sense--and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be\
happy to attend to them.\'94\
\
Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton\'92s absence just at this\
time was the very thing to be desired. She admired him for contriving\
it, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it\
was announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than\
in a civility to her father, from which she was so pointedly excluded.\
She had not even a share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not\
mentioned;--and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an\
ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments, as\
she thought, at first, could not escape her father\'92s suspicion.\
\
It did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so\
sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to\
the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language. It was a\
very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought\
and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse\
talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away\
with all her usual promptitude.\
\
She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She had reason\
to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was desirable that\
she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of\
her other complaint before the gentleman\'92s return. She went to Mrs.\
Goddard\'92s accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary\
penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--She had to destroy\
all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding--to appear in\
the ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge herself\
grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her ideas on one subject, all\
her observations, all her convictions, all her prophecies for the last\
six weeks.\
\
The confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight of\
Harriet\'92s tears made her think that she should never be in charity with\
herself again.\
\
Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--and in every\
thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion\
of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to\
her friend.\
\
Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;\
and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on\
Harriet\'92s side, not her own. Harriet did not consider herself as having\
any thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton\
would have been too great a distinction.--She never could have deserved\
him--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would\
have thought it possible.\
\
Her tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless, that\
no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma\'92s eyes--and\
she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\
understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was the\
superior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would be more for\
her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could\
do.\
\
It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and\
ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of\
being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of\
her life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father\'92s claims, was\
to promote Harriet\'92s comfort, and endeavour to prove her own affection\
in some better method than by match-making. She got her to Hartfield,\
and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and\
amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her\
thoughts.\
\
Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and\
she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in\
general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton\
in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet\'92s age,\
and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be\
made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton\'92s return, as\
to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,\
without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.\
\
Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence\
of any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,\
prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet\
it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive against an\
inclination of that sort _unrequited_, that she could not comprehend its\
continuing very long in equal force.\
\
If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident and\
indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do, she could not\
imagine Harriet\'92s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the\
recollection of him.\
\
Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for\
each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of\
effecting any material change of society. They must encounter each\
other, and make the best of it.\
\
Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs.\
Goddard\'92s; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great\
girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could\
have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or\
repellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be\
found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she saw her in the way of\
cure, there could be no true peace for herself.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVIII\
\
\
Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs.\
Weston\'92s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For\
the present, he could not be spared, to his \'93very great mortification\
and regret; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to\
Randalls at no distant period.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, in\
fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the young man\
had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever\
expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by\
any proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure,\
and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and\
sorry; but then he began to perceive that Frank\'92s coming two or three\
months later would be a much better plan; better time of year;\
better weather; and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay\
considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner.\
\
These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of\
a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of\
excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband was\
to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.\
\
Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr.\
Frank Churchill\'92s not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls.\
The acquaintance at present had no charm for her. She wanted, rather, to\
be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she\
should appear, in general, like her usual self, she took care to express\
as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr.\
and Mrs. Weston\'92s disappointment, as might naturally belong to their\
friendship.\
\
She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite\
as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather\
more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then\
proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\
such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\
looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\
sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\
Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\
with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\
taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\
use of Mrs. Weston\'92s arguments against herself.\
\
\'93The Churchills are very likely in fault,\'94 said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\
\'93but I dare say he might come if he would.\'94\
\
\'93I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come; but\
his uncle and aunt will not spare him.\'94\
\
\'93I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\
point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.\'94\
\
\'93How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose\
him such an unnatural creature?\'94\
\
\'93I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that\
he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little\
for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have\
always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than\
one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud,\
luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If\
Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have contrived it\
between September and January. A man at his age--what is he?--three or\
four-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as much as that.\
It is impossible.\'94\
\
\'93That\'92s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\
own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\
difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\
to manage.\'94\
\
\'93It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\
should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\
money--he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\
much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in\
the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or other. A\
little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can leave the\
Churchills.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sometimes he can.\'94\
\
\'93And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\
there is any temptation of pleasure.\'94\
\
\'93It is very unfair to judge of any body\'92s conduct, without an intimate\
knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\
of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\
family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\
Churchill\'92s temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\
can do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at\
others.\'94\
\
\'93There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\
that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\
resolution. It is Frank Churchill\'92s duty to pay this attention to his\
father. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\
wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\
once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--\'91Every sacrifice of\
mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience;\
but I must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by\
my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion.\
I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.\'92--If he would say so to her\
at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\
opposition made to his going.\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Emma, laughing; \'93but perhaps there might be some made to his\
coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\
use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\
have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to\
your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\
the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\
him!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\
loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable?\'94\
\
\'93Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He\
would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made, of course,\
as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--would do him more\
good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people he\
depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do.\
Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that they could\
trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father, would do\
rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as well as all the\
world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his father; and\
while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not\
thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims. Respect for\
right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort of\
manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would\
bend to his.\'94\
\
\'93I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\
where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have\
a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great\
ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be\
transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill\'92s situation,\
you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for\
him; and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have\
a word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early\
obedience and long observance to break through. To him who has, it might\
not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set\
all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as\
strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so\
equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it.\'94\
\
\'93Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\
exertion, it could not be an equal conviction.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\
understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\
opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\
life.\'94\
\
\'93Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\
occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\
will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\
following his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\
the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\
ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\
their authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\
side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\
would have been no difficulty now.\'94\
\
\'93We shall never agree about him,\'94 cried Emma; \'93but that is nothing\
extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\
I feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\
though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\
complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man\'92s\
perfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\
advantages, it will secure him many others.\'94\
\
\'93Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and\
of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\
expert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\
flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\
himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\
preserving peace at home and preventing his father\'92s having any right to\
complain. His letters disgust me.\'94\
\
\'93Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.\'94\
\
\'93I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy\
a woman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother\'92s\
place, but without a mother\'92s affection to blind her. It is on her\
account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\
feel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\
would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether\
he did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\
considerations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\
herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French,\
not in English. He may be very \'91amiable,\'92 have very good manners, and be\
very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings\
of other people: nothing really amiable about him.\'94\
\
\'93You seem determined to think ill of him.\'94\
\
\'93Me!--not at all,\'94 replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \'93I do not\
want to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits\
as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely personal;\
that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible manners.\'94\
\
\'93Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\
at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\
agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\
bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\
coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\
parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--one object of\
curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\
of nobody else.\'94\
\
\'93You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\
conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\
chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\'94\
\
\'93My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\
every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\
agreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\
and so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects\
which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as\
propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is my\
idea of him.\'94\
\
\'93And mine,\'94 said Mr. Knightley warmly, \'93is, that if he turn out any\
thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\
at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--the\
practised politician, who is to read every body\'92s character, and make\
every body\'92s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\
be dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\
fools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could not\
endure such a puppy when it came to the point.\'94\
\
\'93I will say no more about him,\'94 cried Emma, \'93you turn every thing to\
evil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\
chance of agreeing till he is really here.\'94\
\
\'93Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.\'94\
\
\'93But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love for\
Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.\'94\
\
\'93He is a person I never think of from one month\'92s end to another,\'94 said\
Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately\
talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be\
angry.\
\
To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be of a\
different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of\
mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him; for with all the\
high opinion of himself, which she had often laid to his charge, she had\
never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit\
of another.\

VOLUME II\
\
\
\
CHAPTER I\
\
\
Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma\'92s\
opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could\
not think that Harriet\'92s solace or her own sins required more; and\
she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they\
returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded,\
and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and\
receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--\'93Mr. Elton is so good\
to the poor!\'94 she found something else must be done.\
\
They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.\
She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was\
always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates\
loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few\
who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in\
that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of\
their scanty comforts.\
\
She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,\
as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion\
of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--and\
all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and\
third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore\
she seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden resolution of not\
passing their door without going in--observing, as she proposed it to\
Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite\
safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.\
\
The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied\
the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,\
which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even\
gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was\
seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to\
Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready\
to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit,\
solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse\'92s\
health, cheerful communications about her mother\'92s, and sweet-cake from\
the beaufet--\'93Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called in for ten\
minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and _she_ had\
taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much;\
and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them\
the favour to eat a piece too.\'94\
\
The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.\
There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton\
since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the\
letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much\
he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went,\
and how full the Master of the Ceremonies\'92 ball had been; and she went\
through it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation\
that could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet\'92s\
being obliged to say a word.\
\
This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant,\
having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by\
any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses\
and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not been\
prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually\
hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to\
the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.\
\
\'93Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--Mrs. Cole\
was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--Mrs. Cole was so\
kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as\
she came in, she began inquiring after her, Jane is so very great a\
favourite there. Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to\
shew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much\
as any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying,\
\'91I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her\
time for writing;\'92 and when I immediately said, \'91But indeed we have, we\
had a letter this very morning,\'92 I do not know that I ever saw any body\
more surprized. \'91Have you, upon your honour?\'92 said she; \'91well, that is\
quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she says.\'92\'94\
\
Emma\'92s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--\
\
\'93Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I\
hope she is well?\'94\
\
\'93Thank you. You are so kind!\'94 replied the happily deceived aunt, while\
eagerly hunting for the letter.--\'93Oh! here it is. I was sure it could\
not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being\
aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately\
that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs.\
Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for\
it is such a pleasure to her--a letter from Jane--that she can never\
hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is,\
only just under my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear\
what she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to\
Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you\
see--hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses\
half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She often\
says, when the letter is first opened, \'91Well, Hetty, now I think\
you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work\'92--don\'92t you,\
ma\'92am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out\
herself, if she had nobody to do it for her--every word of it--I am sure\
she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed,\
though my mother\'92s eyes are not so good as they were, she can see\
amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such\
a blessing! My mother\'92s are really very good indeed. Jane often says,\
when she is here, \'91I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong\
eyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I\
only wish my eyes may last me as well.\'92\'94\
\
All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;\
and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss\
Fairfax\'92s handwriting.\
\
\'93You are extremely kind,\'94 replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; \'93you who\
are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure there is\
nobody\'92s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse\'92s.\
My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf you know. Ma\'92am,\'94\
 addressing her, \'93do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say\
about Jane\'92s handwriting?\'94\
\
And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated\
twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She was\
pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very\
rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax\'92s letter, and had almost\
resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss\
Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.\
\
\'93My mother\'92s deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all. By\
only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,\
she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very\
remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.\
Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all\
deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my\
mother\'92s time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, since\
she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as\
I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her\
now.\'94\
\
\'93Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?\'94\
\
\'93Oh yes; next week.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so\
surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she\
will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they can be to see\
her. Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which, because Colonel\
Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So very\
good of them to send her the whole way! But they always do, you know. Oh\
yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she writes about. That is\
the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the\
common course, we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or\
Wednesday.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my\
hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.\'94\
\
\'93So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been\
for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My\
mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months with us at\
least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the\
pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are\
going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come\
over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till the\
summer, but she is so impatient to see them again--for till she married,\
last October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must\
make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,\
but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter\
to her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but\
we shall see presently in Jane\'92s letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon\'92s name as\
well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would\
give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country\
seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great\
deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--I do not know that she ever\
heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know,\
that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his\
addresses--and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them--for\
Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter\'92s\
not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all\
blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss\
Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word\
that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had\
taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane\
was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things.\'94\
\
At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma\'92s\
brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the\
not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther\
discovery,\
\
\'93You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to\
come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship\
between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be\
excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\'94\
\
\'93Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been\
rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a\
distance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thing was\
to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want\
her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.\
Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing\
than their _joint_ invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;\
Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is\
a most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at\
Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the\
sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have\
been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he\
had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--\
(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we had the\
history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!\'94\
\
\'93But, in spite of all her friends\'92 urgency, and her own wish of seeing\
Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?\'94\
\
\'93Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel\
and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should\
recommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native\
air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.\'94\
\
\'93I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.\
Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has\
no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be\
compared with Miss Fairfax.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.\
There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely\
plain--but extremely elegant and amiable.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, that of course.\'94\
\
\'93Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November,\
(as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long\
time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentioned\
it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so\
considerate!--But however, she is so far from well, that her kind\
friends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air\
that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four\
months at Highbury will entirely cure her--and it is certainly a great\
deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is\
unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do.\'94\
\
\'93It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.\'94\
\
\'93And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells\
leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you will\
find from Jane\'92s letter. So sudden!--You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,\
what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of\
her illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and\
looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to\
me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane\'92s letters through\
to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for\
fear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me\
to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;\
but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I\
burst out, quite frightened, with \'91Bless me! poor Jane is ill!\'92--which\
my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed\
at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had\
fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does\
not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my\
guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The\
expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so\
fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for\
attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and\
family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I\
have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to\
her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better\
than I can tell it for her.\'94\
\
\'93I am afraid we must be running away,\'94 said Emma, glancing at Harriet,\
and beginning to rise--\'93My father will be expecting us. I had no\
intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,\
when I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not\
pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so\
pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good\
morning.\'94\
\
And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained\
the street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on her\
against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of\
Jane Fairfax\'92s letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER II\
\
\
Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates\'92s youngest\
daughter.\
\
The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the ----regiment of infantry,\
and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope\
and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy\
remembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking under\
consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.\
\
By birth she belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on\
losing her mother, she became the property, the charge, the consolation,\
the foundling of her grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every\
probability of her being permanently fixed there; of her being taught\
only what very limited means could command, and growing up with no\
advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what\
nature had given her in a pleasing person, good understanding, and\
warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.\
\
But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change\
to her destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded\
Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and\
farther, had been indebted to him for such attentions, during a severe\
camp-fever, as he believed had saved his life. These were claims which\
he did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the\
death of poor Fairfax, before his own return to England put any thing in\
his power. When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice\
of her. He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about\
Jane\'92s age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and\
growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old, his\
daughter\'92s great fondness for her, and his own wish of being a real\
friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking\
the whole charge of her education. It was accepted; and from that period\
Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell\'92s family, and had lived with them\
entirely, only visiting her grandmother from time to time.\
\
The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others; the\
very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making\
independence impossible. To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel\
Campbell\'92s power; for though his income, by pay and appointments, was\
handsome, his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter\'92s;\
but, by giving her an education, he hoped to be supplying the means of\
respectable subsistence hereafter.\
\
Such was Jane Fairfax\'92s history. She had fallen into good hands, known\
nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent\
education. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people,\
her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline\
and culture; and Colonel Campbell\'92s residence being in London, every\
lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of\
first-rate masters. Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy\
of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was,\
as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,\
fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she was too\
much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote,\
and the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It was\
easy to decide that she was still too young; and Jane remained with\
them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of\
an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with\
only the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her own\
good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over.\
\
The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss\
Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from\
the circumstance of Jane\'92s decided superiority both in beauty and\
acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen\
by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the\
parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till the\
marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often\
defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is\
moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of\
Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were\
acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had\
yet her bread to earn.\
\
This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be\
yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path\
of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had\
fixed on for beginning. She had long resolved that one-and-twenty\
should be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she had\
resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from\
all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace\
and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.\
\
The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such\
a resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no\
exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for\
their own comfort they would have retained her wholly; but this would\
be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they\
began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the\
temptation of any delay, and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments\
of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however,\
affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying\
on the wretched moment. She had never been quite well since the time of\
their daughter\'92s marriage; and till she should have completely recovered\
her usual strength, they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so\
far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits,\
seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something\
more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with\
tolerable comfort.\
\
With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account to her\
aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths\
not told. It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to\
Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect liberty with\
those kind relations to whom she was so very dear: and the Campbells,\
whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or\
treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they\
depended more on a few months spent in her native air, for the recovery\
of her health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she was to\
come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which\
had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for the\
present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two\
years\'92 absence.\
\
Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like\
through three long months!--to be always doing more than she wished,\
and less than she ought! Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a\
difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her it was\
because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman, which she\
wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly\
refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which\
her conscience could not quite acquit her. But \'93she could never get\
acquainted with her: she did not know how it was, but there was such\
coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she pleased or\
not--and then, her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made\
such a fuss with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that\
they were to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every\
body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.\'94 These were her\
reasons--she had no better.\
\
It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified\
by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any\
considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her; and\
now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years\'92\
interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance and\
manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating. Jane\
Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had herself the\
highest value for elegance. Her height was pretty, just such as almost\
every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her\
figure particularly graceful; her size a most becoming medium, between\
fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point\
out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and\
then, her face--her features--there was more beauty in them altogether\
than she had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing\
beauty. Her eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had\
never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to\
cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really\
needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was\
the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour, by all her\
principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind,\
she saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction,\
and merit.\
\
In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with\
twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering\
justice, and was determining that she would dislike her no longer. When\
she took in her history, indeed, her situation, as well as her beauty;\
when she considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she was\
going to sink from, how she was going to live, it seemed impossible\
to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every\
well-known particular entitling her to interest, were added the highly\
probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had\
so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more\
pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.\
Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr. Dixon\'92s\
actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous which her imagination\
had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single,\
successless love on her side alone. She might have been unconsciously\
sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his conversation with her\
friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be\
denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself\
effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of\
laborious duty.\
\
Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,\
as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury\
afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence; nobody that she\
could wish to scheme about for her.\
\
These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had committed\
herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax,\
or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than\
saying to Mr. Knightley, \'93She certainly is handsome; she is better than\
handsome!\'94 Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother\
and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.\
Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more\
tiresome, because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration\
of her powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how\
little bread and butter she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice\
of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new\
workbags for her mother and herself; and Jane\'92s offences rose again.\
They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise\
which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an\
air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very\
superior performance. She was, besides, which was the worst of all, so\
cold, so cautious! There was no getting at her real opinion. Wrapt up in\
a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined to hazard nothing. She was\
disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.\
\
If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more reserved on\
the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She seemed bent\
on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon\'92s character, or her own value\
for his company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all\
general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.\
It did her no service however. Her caution was thrown away. Emma saw\
its artifice, and returned to her first surmises. There probably _was_\
something more to conceal than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps,\
had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only\
to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.\
\
The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She and Mr. Frank Churchill\
had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a\
little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma\
procure as to what he truly was. \'93Was he handsome?\'94--\'93She believed\
he was reckoned a very fine young man.\'94 \'93Was he agreeable?\'94--\'93He was\
generally thought so.\'94 \'93Did he appear a sensible young man; a young\
man of information?\'94--\'93At a watering-place, or in a common London\
acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were\
all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than\
they had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She believed every body found his\
manners pleasing.\'94 Emma could not forgive her.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER III\
\
\
Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment\
were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had\
seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was\
expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with\
Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might\
have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough\
to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her unjust to\
Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.\
\
\'93A very pleasant evening,\'94 he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been\
talked into what was necessary, told that he understood, and the papers\
swept away;--\'93particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some\
very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting\
at one\'92s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women;\
sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss\
Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing\
undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument\
at her grandmother\'92s, it must have been a real indulgence.\'94\
\
\'93I am happy you approved,\'94 said Emma, smiling; \'93but I hope I am not\
often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.\'94\
\
\'93No, my dear,\'94 said her father instantly; \'93_that_ I am sure you are not.\
There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing,\
you are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had been handed\
round once, I think it would have been enough.\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; \'93you are not often\
deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I\
think you understand me, therefore.\'94\
\
An arch look expressed--\'93I understand you well enough;\'94 but she said\
only, \'93Miss Fairfax is reserved.\'94\
\
\'93I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome all\
that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its\
foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured.\'94\
\
\'93You think her diffident. I do not see it.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Emma,\'94 said he, moving from his chair into one close by her,\
\'93you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant\
evening.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and\
amused to think how little information I obtained.\'94\
\
\'93I am disappointed,\'94 was his only answer.\
\
\'93I hope every body had a pleasant evening,\'94 said Mr. Woodhouse, in his\
quiet way. \'93I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I\
moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.\
Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she always is, though\
she speaks rather too quick. However, she is very agreeable, and Mrs.\
Bates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane\
Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a\
very well-behaved young lady indeed. She must have found the evening\
agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma.\'94\
\
\'93True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax.\'94\
\
Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the\
present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--\
\
\'93She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one\'92s eyes from.\
I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to\
express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose\
thoughts were on the Bates\'92s, said--\
\
\'93It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a\
great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one can\
venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--Now we\
have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg;\
it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like any other\
pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure\
of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without\
the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast\
pork--I think we had better send the leg--do not you think so, my dear?\'94\
\
\'93My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it.\
There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and\
the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.\'94\
\
\'93That\'92s right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but\
that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it\
is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle\
boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a\
little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.\'94\
\
\'93Emma,\'94 said Mr. Knightley presently, \'93I have a piece of news for you.\
You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will\
interest you.\'94\
\
\'93News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?--why do you smile\
so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?\'94\
\
He had time only to say,\
\
\'93No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,\'94 when the door was\
thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full\
of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest.\
Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another\
syllable of communication could rest with him.\
\
\'93Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse--I\
come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You\
are too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be\
married.\'94\
\
Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so\
completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a\
little blush, at the sound.\
\
\'93There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,\'94 said Mr.\
Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what\
had passed between them.\
\
\'93But where could _you_ hear it?\'94 cried Miss Bates. \'93Where could you\
possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I\
received Mrs. Cole\'92s note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at least\
ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out--I\
was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane was\
standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--for my mother was so\
afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would\
go down and see, and Jane said, \'91Shall I go down instead? for I think\
you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.\'92--\'91Oh!\
my dear,\'92 said I--well, and just then came the note. A Miss\
Hawkins--that\'92s all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley,\
how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told\
Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins--\'94\
\
\'93I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He had just\
read Elton\'92s letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.\'94\
\
\'93Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more\
generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My\
mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a thousand\
thanks, and says you really quite oppress her.\'94\
\
\'93We consider our Hartfield pork,\'94 replied Mr. Woodhouse--\'93indeed it\
certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannot\
have a greater pleasure than--\'94\
\
\'93Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good\
to us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth\
themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.\
We may well say that \'91our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.\'92 Well, Mr.\
Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--\'94\
\
\'93It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.\'94--\
Here was a sly glance at Emma. \'93He had been so fortunate as to--I forget\
the precise words--one has no business to remember them. The information\
was, as you state, that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. By\
his style, I should imagine it just settled.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Elton going to be married!\'94 said Emma, as soon as she could speak.\
\'93He will have every body\'92s wishes for his happiness.\'94\
\
\'93He is very young to settle,\'94 was Mr. Woodhouse\'92s observation. \'93He had\
better not be in a hurry. He seemed to me very well off as he was. We\
were always glad to see him at Hartfield.\'94\
\
\'93A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!\'94 said Miss Bates, joyfully;\
\'93my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot bear to have the poor old\
Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you have\
never seen Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see\
him.\'94\
\
Jane\'92s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to\
occupy her.\
\
\'93No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,\'94 she replied, starting on this appeal;\
\'93is he--is he a tall man?\'94\
\
\'93Who shall answer that question?\'94 cried Emma. \'93My father would say\
\'91yes,\'92 Mr. Knightley \'91no;\'92 and Miss Bates and I that he is just the\
happy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax,\
you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in\
Highbury, both in person and mind.\'94\
\
\'93Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will. He is the very best young\
man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he\
was precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins,--I dare say, an\
excellent young woman. His extreme attention to my mother--wanting\
her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better, for my\
mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she does not\
hear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He\
fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--but she says it did\
him no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel.\
And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him. It\
is such a happiness when good people get together--and they always do.\
Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles,\
such very good people; and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a\
happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,\'94 turning\
to Mr. Woodhouse, \'93I think there are few places with such society as\
Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear\
sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is\
pork--a roast loin of pork--\'94\
\
\'93As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted\
with her,\'94 said Emma, \'93nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that it\
cannot be a very long acquaintance. He has been gone only four weeks.\'94\
\
Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,\
Emma said,\
\
\'93You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take an interest\
in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late\
on these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss\
Campbell\'92s account--we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr.\
Elton and Miss Hawkins.\'94\
\
\'93When I have seen Mr. Elton,\'94 replied Jane, \'93I dare say I shall be\
interested--but I believe it requires _that_ with me. And as it is some\
months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn\
off.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,\'94\
 said Miss Bates, \'93four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had\
always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that\
I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said, \'91No, Mr.\
Elton is a most worthy young man--but\'92--In short, I do not think I am\
particularly quick at those sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it.\
What is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if\
Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so\
good-humouredly. She knows I would not offend for the world. How does\
Miss Smith do? She seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs.\
John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do you\
know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in\
person--tall, and with that sort of look--and not very talkative.\'94\
\
\'93Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all.\'94\
\
\'93Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.\
One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is\
not, strictly speaking, handsome?\'94\
\
\'93Handsome! Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain. I told you he was\
plain.\'94\
\
\'93My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,\
and that you yourself--\'94\
\
\'93Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard,\
I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the\
general opinion, when I called him plain.\'94\
\
\'93Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does\
not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my\
dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most\
agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole\'92s;\
but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home\
directly--I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the\
better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not\
attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares for\
any thing but _boiled_ pork: when we dress the leg it will be another\
thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming\
too. Well, that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be\
so kind as to give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good\
morning to you.\'94\
\
Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him while\
he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and to\
marry strangers too--and the other half she could give to her own view\
of the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece\
of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she\
was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope\
was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from hearing\
it abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she was likely\
to call. If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its\
beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would\
be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard\'92s, and that the intelligence would\
undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.\
\
The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,\
when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which\
hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the \'93Oh! Miss\
Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!\'94 which instantly burst forth,\
had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow was\
given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in\
listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to\
tell. \'93She had set out from Mrs. Goddard\'92s half an hour ago--she had\
been afraid it would rain--she had been afraid it would pour down\
every moment--but she thought she might get to Hartfield first--she\
had hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the\
house where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she\
would just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem\
to stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,\
and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as\
she could, and took shelter at Ford\'92s.\'94--Ford\'92s was the principal\
woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher\'92s shop united; the shop\
first in size and fashion in the place.--\'93And so, there she had\
set, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes,\
perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--to be sure it was\
so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford\'92s--who should come in, but\
Elizabeth Martin and her brother!--Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I\
thought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting\
near the door--Elizabeth saw me directly; but he did not; he was busy\
with the umbrella. I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly,\
and took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the\
shop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!\
I am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away\
you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the\
world but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last, I fancy, he\
looked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her buyings, they\
began whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and\
I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do\
you think he was, Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came\
quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,\
if I would. She did not do any of it in the same way that she used; I\
could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to _try_ to be very\
friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no\
more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she said she\
was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss\
Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to\
hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting\
away--and then--only think!--I found he was coming up towards me\
too--slowly you know, and as if he did not quite know what to do; and\
so he came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling\
dreadfully, you know, one can\'92t tell how; and then I took courage, and\
said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got\
three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say, if I was\
going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole\'92s\
stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh!\
dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was\
very much obliged to him: you know I could not do less; and then he went\
back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--I believe I did--but\
I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\
I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know,\
there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and\
so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and\
make me comfortable again.\'94\
\
Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in\
her power. She was obliged to stop and think. She was not thoroughly\
comfortable herself. The young man\'92s conduct, and his sister\'92s, seemed\
the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them. As Harriet\
described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection\
and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she had believed them to be\
well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make\
in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Of\
course, he must be sorry to lose her--they must be all sorry. Ambition,\
as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all have hoped\
to rise by Harriet\'92s acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of\
Harriet\'92s description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--what\
signified her praise?\
\
She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering\
all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt\
on,\
\
\'93It might be distressing, for the moment,\'94 said she; \'93but you seem to\
have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never,\
as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about\
it.\'94\
\
Harriet said, \'93very true,\'94 and she \'93would not think about it;\'94 but still\
she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at\
last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry\
on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution;\
hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only\
amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of\
Mr. Elton\'92s importance with her!\
\
Mr. Elton\'92s rights, however, gradually revived. Though she did not feel\
the first intelligence as she might have done the day before, or an hour\
before, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation\
was over, she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity,\
wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins,\
which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in\
her fancy.\
\
Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It\
had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any\
influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get\
at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted either the\
courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her refusal of the\
brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard\'92s; and a twelvemonth\
might pass without their being thrown together again, with any\
necessity, or even any power of speech.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IV\
\
\
Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting\
situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of\
being kindly spoken of.\
\
A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins\'92s name was first mentioned in\
Highbury, before she was, by some means or other, discovered to have\
every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly\
accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived\
to triumph in his happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her merits,\
there was very little more for him to do, than to tell her Christian\
name, and say whose music she principally played.\
\
Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He had gone away rejected and\
mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what\
appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing the right\
lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He\
had gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged to another--and\
to another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such\
circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He came back gay\
and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse,\
and defying Miss Smith.\
\
The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of\
perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,\
of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some\
dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he had not\
thrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts;\
and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--the first hour of\
introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice;\
the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress\
of the affair was so glorious--the steps so quick, from the accidental\
rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green\'92s, and the party at Mrs.\
Brown\'92s--smiles and blushes rising in importance--with consciousness and\
agitation richly scattered--the lady had been so easily impressed--so\
sweetly disposed--had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase,\
been so very ready to have him, that vanity and prudence were equally\
contented.\
\
He had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection, and\
was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself and\
his own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be laughed\
at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young\
ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he would have been more\
cautiously gallant.\
\
The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to\
please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and\
when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which\
a certain glance of Mrs. Cole\'92s did not seem to contradict, that when he\
next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.\
\
During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just enough\
to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her the impression\
of his not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now\
spread over his air. She was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder\
that she had ever thought him pleasing at all; and his sight was so\
inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that,\
except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable\
humiliation to her own mind, she would have been thankful to be assured\
of never seeing him again. She wished him very well; but he gave\
her pain, and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most\
satisfaction.\
\
The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must\
certainly be lessened by his marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be\
prevented--many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A _Mrs._ _Elton_ would\
be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink\
without remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility\
again.\
\
Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She was good enough\
for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--handsome\
enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet\'92s side. As to connexion,\
there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his own vaunted\
claims and disdain of Harriet, he had done nothing. On that article,\
truth seemed attainable. _What_ she was, must be uncertain; but _who_\
she was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not\
appear that she was at all Harriet\'92s superior. She brought no name, no\
blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters\
of a Bristol--merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole\
of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it\
was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very\
moderate also. Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath;\
but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the\
father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--in the law\
line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him, than\
that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter had lived. Emma\
guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise.\
And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder\
sister, who was _very_ _well_ _married_, to a gentleman in a _great_\
_way_, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the\
history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.\
\
Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all! She had\
talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out\
of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet\'92s\
mind was not to be talked away. He might be superseded by another; he\
certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin\
would have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure\
her. Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always\
in love. And now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this\
reappearance of Mr. Elton. She was always having a glimpse of him\
somewhere or other. Emma saw him only once; but two or three times every\
day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him, or _just_ to miss him,\
_just_ to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, _just_ to have something\
occur to preserve him in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of\
surprize and conjecture. She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about\
him; for, excepting when at Hartfield, she was always among those who\
saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as\
the discussion of his concerns; and every report, therefore, every\
guess--all that had already occurred, all that might occur in the\
arrangement of his affairs, comprehending income, servants, and\
furniture, was continually in agitation around her. Her regard was\
receiving strength by invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept\
alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss\
Hawkins\'92s happiness, and continual observation of, how much he seemed\
attached!--his air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his\
hat, being all in proof of how much he was in love!\
\
Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her\
friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet\'92s mind,\
Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton\
predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful\
as a check to the other. Mr. Elton\'92s engagement had been the cure of\
the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the\
knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth\
Martin\'92s calling at Mrs. Goddard\'92s a few days afterwards. Harriet had\
not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her, written\
in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great\
deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much\
occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,\
and wishing to do more than she dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in\
person, had driven away all such cares. While he staid, the Martins were\
forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again,\
Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best\
for her to return Elizabeth Martin\'92s visit.\
\
How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--and\
what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.\
Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would\
be ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the\
acquaintance--!\
\
After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than\
Harriet\'92s returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had\
understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal\
acquaintance. She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the\
Abbey Mill, while she drove a little farther, and call for her again\
so soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous\
recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree\
of intimacy was chosen for the future.\
\
She could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it\
which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, merely\
glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?\
\
\
\
CHAPTER V\
\
\
Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her\
friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard\'92s, her evil stars had led her\
to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to _The Rev.\
Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath_, was to be seen under the operation of\
being lifted into the butcher\'92s cart, which was to convey it to where\
the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk\
and the direction, was consequently a blank.\
\
She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to be\
put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between\
espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which\
had given her so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to\
revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her\
to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined\
her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour.\
She went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who\
was married, and settled in Donwell.\
\
The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;\
and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay, and\
unattended by any alarming young man. She came solitarily down the\
gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with\
her seemingly with ceremonious civility.\
\
Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She was\
feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her enough to\
understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.\
She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her\
doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had\
been talked almost all the time--till just at last, when Mrs. Martin\'92s\
saying, all of a sudden, that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had\
brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very\
room she had been measured last September, with her two friends. There\
were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window.\
_He_ had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour,\
the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness, the same\
regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they\
were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect,\
as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage\
reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness\
of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given\
to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months\
ago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might\
resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She\
would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had\
the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a\
_little_ higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she\
have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent. They must be\
separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much\
to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity of a little\
consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to\
procure it. Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The\
refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.\
\
It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither\
\'93master nor mistress was at home;\'94 they had both been out some time; the\
man believed they were gone to Hartfield.\
\
\'93This is too bad,\'94 cried Emma, as they turned away. \'93And now we shall\
just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so\
disappointed.\'94 And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her\
murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being\
the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage\
stopt; she looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were\
standing to speak to her. There was instant pleasure in the sight of\
them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston\
immediately accosted her with,\
\
\'93How d\'92ye do?--how d\'92ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--glad\
to see him so well. Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter this\
morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--he is at\
Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be\
so. If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days; I\
was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have\
just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather. We shall\
enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could\
wish.\'94\
\
There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the\
influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston\'92s, confirmed as it all was\
by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not\
less to the purpose. To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was\
enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in\
their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits.\
The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in\
the rapidity of half a moment\'92s thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now\
be talked of no more.\
\
Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which\
allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command,\
as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened,\
and smiled, and congratulated.\
\
\'93I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield,\'94 said he, at the conclusion.\
\
Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his\
wife.\
\
\'93We had better move on, Mr. Weston,\'94 said she, \'93we are detaining the\
girls.\'94\
\
\'93Well, well, I am ready;\'94--and turning again to Emma, \'93but you must\
not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man; you have only\
had _my_ account you know; I dare say he is really nothing\
extraordinary:\'94--though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were\
speaking a very different conviction.\
\
Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a\
manner that appropriated nothing.\
\
\'93Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o\'92clock,\'94 was Mrs.\
Weston\'92s parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only\
for her.\
\
\'93Four o\'92clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three,\'94 was Mr.\
Weston\'92s quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.\
Emma\'92s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore\
a different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as\
before. When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder at least\
must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet, she saw\
something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.\
\
\'93Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?\'94--was a\
question, however, which did not augur much.\
\
But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma\
was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.\
\
The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston\'92s faithful\
pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o\'92clock, that\
she was to think of her at four.\
\
\'93My dear, dear anxious friend,\'94--said she, in mental soliloquy, while\
walking downstairs from her own room, \'93always overcareful for every\
body\'92s comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets,\
going again and again into his room, to be sure that all is right.\'94\
 The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall. \'93\'91Tis twelve;\
I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this\
time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the\
possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him\
soon.\'94\
\
She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her\
father--Mr. Weston and his son. They had been arrived only a few\
minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank\'92s\
being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the midst of his\
very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared, to have her\
share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.\
\
The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually\
before her--he was presented to her, and she did not think too much had\
been said in his praise; he was a _very_ good looking young man; height,\
air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his countenance had a great\
deal of the spirit and liveliness of his father\'92s; he looked quick and\
sensible. She felt immediately that she should like him; and there was\
a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her\
that he came intending to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted\
they soon must be.\
\
He had reached Randalls the evening before. She was pleased with the\
eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel\
earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day.\
\
\'93I told you yesterday,\'94 cried Mr. Weston with exultation, \'93I told you\
all that he would be here before the time named. I remembered what I\
used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help\
getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in\
upon one\'92s friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal\
more than any little exertion it needs.\'94\
\
\'93It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,\'94 said the young\
man, \'93though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;\
but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing.\'94\
\
The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency.\
Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the\
conviction was strengthened by what followed. He was very much pleased\
with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly\
allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to\
Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself\
to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but\
one\'92s _own_ country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That\
he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before,\
passed suspiciously through Emma\'92s brain; but still, if it were a\
falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His manner had\
no air of study or exaggeration. He did really look and speak as if in a\
state of no common enjoyment.\
\
Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening\
acquaintance. On his side were the inquiries,--\'93Was she a\
horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--Pleasant walks?--Had they a large\
neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There were\
several very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was\
it a musical society?\'94\
\
But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance\
proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity, while\
their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his\
mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise, so much\
warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his\
father, and her very kind reception of himself, as was an additional\
proof of his knowing how to please--and of his certainly thinking it\
worth while to try to please her. He did not advance a word of praise\
beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but,\
undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter. He understood\
what would be welcome; he could be sure of little else. \'93His father\'92s\
marriage,\'94 he said, \'93had been the wisest measure, every friend must\
rejoice in it; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing\
must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on\
him.\'94\
\
He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor\'92s merits,\
without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it\
was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse\'92s\
character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor\'92s. And at last, as if\
resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its\
object, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of\
her person.\
\
\'93Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,\'94 said he; \'93but I\
confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a\
very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that\
I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.\'94\
\
\'93You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,\'94\
 said Emma; \'93were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen with\
pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such\
words. Don\'92t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty\
young woman.\'94\
\
\'93I hope I should know better,\'94 he replied; \'93no, depend upon it, (with a\
gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom\
I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my\
terms.\'94\
\
Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from\
their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind,\
had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered\
as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She must see more\
of him to understand his ways; at present she only felt they were\
agreeable.\
\
She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His quick\
eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy\
expression; and even, when he might have determined not to look, she was\
confident that he was often listening.\
\
Her own father\'92s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the\
entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion,\
was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he was not farther from\
approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--Though always objecting\
to every marriage that was arranged, he never suffered beforehand from\
the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of\
any two persons\'92 understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it\
were proved against them. She blessed the favouring blindness. He could\
now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a\
glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest, give way to all\
his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr.\
Frank Churchill\'92s accommodation on his journey, through the sad evils\
of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed\
anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold--which,\
however, he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till\
after another night.\
\
A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--\'93He must be going.\
He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands for\
Mrs. Weston at Ford\'92s, but he need not hurry any body else.\'94 His son,\
too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,\
\
\'93As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity\
of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore\
may as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with\
a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near\
Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty,\
I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not\
the proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any\
family of that name?\'94\
\
\'93To be sure we do,\'94 cried his father; \'93Mrs. Bates--we passed her\
house--I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted\
with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine girl\
she is. Call upon her, by all means.\'94\
\
\'93There is no necessity for my calling this morning,\'94 said the young man;\
\'93another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance\
at Weymouth which--\'94\
\
\'93Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done\
cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank;\
any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided. You saw\
her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body she mixed\
with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough\
to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.\'94\
\
The son looked convinced.\
\
\'93I have heard her speak of the acquaintance,\'94 said Emma; \'93she is a very\
elegant young woman.\'94\
\
He agreed to it, but with so quiet a \'93Yes,\'94 as inclined her almost to\
doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort\
of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought\
only ordinarily gifted with it.\
\
\'93If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,\'94 said she,\
\'93I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage; see her and\
hear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all, for she has an\
aunt who never holds her tongue.\'94\
\
\'93You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?\'94 said Mr.\
Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation; \'93then give\
me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young\
lady. She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt, very\
worthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely\
glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to\
shew you the way.\'94\
\
\'93My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.\'94\
\
\'93But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,\
quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many\
houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,\
unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you\
had best cross the street.\'94\
\
Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,\
and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, \'93My good friend,\
this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees\
it, and as to Mrs. Bates\'92s, he may get there from the Crown in a hop,\
step, and jump.\'94\
\
They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a\
graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remained\
very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now\
engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full\
confidence in their comfort.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VI\
\
\
The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He came with Mrs.\
Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially. He had\
been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home, till\
her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk,\
immediately fixed on Highbury.--\'93He did not doubt there being very\
pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him, he should always\
chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury,\
would be his constant attraction.\'94--Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood\
for Hartfield; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with\
him. They walked thither directly.\
\
Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for\
half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome, knew\
nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her,\
therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in\
arm. She was wanting to see him again, and especially to see him in\
company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him\
was to depend. If he were deficient there, nothing should make amends\
for it. But on seeing them together, she became perfectly satisfied. It\
was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his\
duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to\
her--nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as\
a friend and securing her affection. And there was time enough for Emma\
to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of\
the morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour\
or two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards\
in Highbury. He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield\
sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse\'92s ear; and when their going farther was\
resolved on, confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole\
village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than\
Emma could have supposed.\
\
Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He\
begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long, and\
which had been the home of his father\'92s father; and on recollecting that\
an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest of\
her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in\
some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they\
shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must\
be very like a merit to those he was with.\
\
Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it\
could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting\
himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making a parade of\
insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him\
justice.\
\
Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though\
the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses\
were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any\
run on the road; and his companions had not expected to be detained by\
any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of\
the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for\
a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly\
populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such\
brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for\
which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established\
among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He was immediately\
interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him; and instead of\
passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed\
windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities,\
and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He saw no fault\
in the room, he would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it\
was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the\
very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every\
fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived\
the former good old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in\
Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction\
that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted\
to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied. He could not be\
persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw around him, could\
not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars\
were given and families described, he was still unwilling to admit that\
the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there\
would be the smallest difficulty in every body\'92s returning into their\
proper place the next morning. He argued like a young man very much bent\
on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of\
the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.\
He seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social\
inclinations of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of\
Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his\
indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of\
mind. He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.\
It was but an effusion of lively spirits.\
\
At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;\
and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma\
recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him if he had\
paid it.\
\
\'93Yes, oh! yes\'94--he replied; \'93I was just going to mention it. A very\
successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much\
obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken\
me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I\
was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes\
would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and\
I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him--but there\
was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found,\
when he (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had\
been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour.\
The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.\'94\
\
\'93And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?\'94\
\
\'93Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look\
ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies\
can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so\
pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--A most\
deplorable want of complexion.\'94\
\
Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax\'92s\
complexion. \'93It was certainly never brilliant, but she would not\
allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and\
delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of\
her face.\'94 He listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he had\
heard many people say the same--but yet he must confess, that to him\
nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where\
features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all;\
and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he need not\
attempt to describe what the effect was.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Emma, \'93there is no disputing about taste.--At least you\
admire her except her complexion.\'94\
\
He shook his head and laughed.--\'93I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her\
complexion.\'94\
\
\'93Did you see her often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?\'94\
\
At this moment they were approaching Ford\'92s, and he hastily exclaimed,\
\'93Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of\
their lives, as my father informs me. He comes to Highbury himself, he\
says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford\'92s.\
If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove\
myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must\
buy something at Ford\'92s. It will be taking out my freedom.--I dare say\
they sell gloves.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will\
be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because\
you were Mr. Weston\'92s son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford\'92s, and your\
popularity will stand upon your own virtues.\'94\
\
They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of \'93Men\'92s Beavers\'94\
 and \'93York Tan\'94 were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he\
said--\'93But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me,\
you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_\
_patriae_. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of\
public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in\
private life.\'94\
\
\'93I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her\
party at Weymouth.\'94\
\
\'93And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a\
very unfair one. It is always the lady\'92s right to decide on the degree\
of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--I\
shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow.\'94\
\
\'93Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself. But\
her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she is so very\
reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any\
body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance\
with her.\'94\
\
\'93May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so\
well. I met her frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a\
little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.\
Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,\
warm-hearted woman. I like them all.\'94\
\
\'93You know Miss Fairfax\'92s situation in life, I conclude; what she is\
destined to be?\'94\
\
\'93Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do.\'94\
\
\'93You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,\'94 said Mrs. Weston smiling;\
\'93remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say\
when you speak of Miss Fairfax\'92s situation in life. I will move a little\
farther off.\'94\
\
\'93I certainly do forget to think of _her_,\'94 said Emma, \'93as having ever\
been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.\'94\
\
He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.\
\
When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, \'93Did\
you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?\'94 said Frank\
Churchill.\
\
\'93Ever hear her!\'94 repeated Emma. \'93You forget how much she belongs to\
Highbury. I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began.\
She plays charmingly.\'94\
\
\'93You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who\
could really judge. She appeared to me to play well, that is, with\
considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--I am\
excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right\
of judging of any body\'92s performance.--I have been used to hear her\'92s\
admired; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well:--a\
man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged to\
her--on the point of marriage--would yet never ask that other woman\
to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down\
instead--never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other.\
That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.\'94\
\
\'93Proof indeed!\'94 said Emma, highly amused.--\'93Mr. Dixon is very musical,\
is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you,\
than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a\
very strong proof.\'94\
\
\'93Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger\
than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable\
to me. I could not excuse a man\'92s having more music than love--more ear\
than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.\
How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?\'94\
\
\'93It was her very particular friend, you know.\'94\
\
\'93Poor comfort!\'94 said Emma, laughing. \'93One would rather have a stranger\
preferred than one\'92s very particular friend--with a stranger it might\
not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend\
always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--Poor\
Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland.\'94\
\
\'93You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she\
really did not seem to feel it.\'94\
\
\'93So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. But\
be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship, or\
dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt\
it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous\
distinction.\'94\
\
\'93As to that--I do not--\'94\
\
\'93Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax\'92s\
sensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human\
being, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she\
was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.\'94\
\
\'93There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--\'94\
 he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, \'93however, it is\
impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--how it might\
all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness\
outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be\
a better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct\
herself in critical situations, than I can be.\'94\
\
\'93I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children\
and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be\
intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited\
her friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a\
little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take\
disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was,\
by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve--I\
never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.\'94\
\
\'93It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,\'94 said he. \'93Oftentimes very\
convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve,\
but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person.\'94\
\
\'93Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction\
may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an\
agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of\
conquering any body\'92s reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss\
Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think\
ill of her--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetual\
cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea\
about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to\
conceal.\'94\
\
He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and\
thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him,\
that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He was\
not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some\
of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better\
than she had expected. His ideas seemed more moderate--his feelings\
warmer. She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr.\
Elton\'92s house, which, as well as the church, he would go and look at,\
and would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he could not\
believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for\
having. If it were to be shared with the woman he loved, he could not\
think any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample\
room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who\
wanted more.\
\
Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.\
Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many\
advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could be no\
judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma,\
in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he was talking\
about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in\
life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He might not be aware of the\
inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper\'92s room, or\
a bad butler\'92s pantry, but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe\
could not make him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would\
willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VII\
\
\
Emma\'92s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the\
following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London, merely to have\
his hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast, and\
he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner,\
but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut.\
There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over\
on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it\
which she could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality of\
plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart,\
which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday. Vanity,\
extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be\
doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his\
father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear\
in general; he became liable to all these charges. His father only\
called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs.\
Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as\
quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that \'93all young\
people would have their little whims.\'94\
\
With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit\
hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston\
was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made\
himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether. He\
appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and\
lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions, a great deal\
decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard, was fond of\
talking of him--said he would be the best man in the world if he were\
left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he\
acknowledged her kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to\
speak of her with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for\
such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut, there was nothing to\
denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination\
had given him; the honour, if not of being really in love with her,\
of being at least very near it, and saved only by her own\
indifference--(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the\
honour, in short, of being marked out for her by all their joint\
acquaintance.\
\
Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must\
have some weight. He gave her to understand that Frank admired her\
extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so\
much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him\
harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, \'93all young people would have their\
little whims.\'94\
\
There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so\
leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of\
Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made\
for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so\
often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be\
softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley.\
The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was\
silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself,\
over a newspaper he held in his hand, \'93Hum! just the trifling, silly\
fellow I took him for.\'94 She had half a mind to resent; but an instant\'92s\
observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his\
own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.\
\
Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and\
Mrs. Weston\'92s visit this morning was in another respect particularly\
opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma\
want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she wanted exactly\
the advice they gave.\
\
This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in\
Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and\
unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade,\
and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country,\
they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little\
company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had\
brought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town had\
yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With\
their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their\
inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number\
of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were,\
in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.\
Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body\
for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the\
single men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma\
could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor\
Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt _her_ to go, if they did;\
and she regretted that her father\'92s known habits would be giving\
her refusal less meaning than she could wish. The Coles were very\
respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not\
for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit\
them. This lesson, she very much feared, they would receive only from\
herself; she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.\
\
But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks\
before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her\
very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their\
invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs.\
Weston\'92s accounting for it with \'93I suppose they will not take the\
liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,\'94 was not quite\
sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of\
refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there,\
consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred\
again and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted\
to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They\
had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,\
and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence. Might\
not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his. The bare\
possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and\
her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be\
intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.\
\
It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at\
Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first\
remark, on reading it, was that \'93of course it must be declined,\'94 she so\
very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their\
advice for her going was most prompt and successful.\
\
She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely\
without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so\
properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much\
consideration for her father. \'93They would have solicited the honour\
earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from\
London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of\
air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour\
of his company.\'94 Upon the whole, she was very persuadable; and it being\
briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting\
his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be\
depended on for bearing him company--Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked\
into an acquiescence of his daughter\'92s going out to dinner on a day now\
near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him. As for _his_\
going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be\
too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned.\
\
\'93I am not fond of dinner-visiting,\'94 said he--\'93I never was. No more is\
Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole\
should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come\
in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us\
in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so\
reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the\
evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any\
body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine\
with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take\
care of her, I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what\
it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.\'94 Then turning to Mrs.\
Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--\'93Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not\
married, you would have staid at home with me.\'94\
\
\'93Well, sir,\'94 cried Mr. Weston, \'93as I took Miss Taylor away, it is\
incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs.\
Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.\'94\
\
But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing,\
not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse\'92s agitation. The ladies knew better how\
to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately\
arranged.\
\
With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking\
as usual. \'93He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He had a great regard\
for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her. James\
could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written\
to Mrs. Cole.\'94\
\
\'93You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say\
that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline\
their obliging invitation; beginning with my _compliments_, of course.\
But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be\
done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be\
wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him. We have never\
been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have\
no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there,\
you must tell him at what time you would have him come for you again;\
and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late.\
You will get very tired when tea is over.\'94\
\
\'93But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many\
people talking at once. You will not like the noise.\'94\
\
\'93But, my dear sir,\'94 cried Mr. Weston, \'93if Emma comes away early, it will\
be breaking up the party.\'94\
\
\'93And no great harm if it does,\'94 said Mr. Woodhouse. \'93The sooner every\
party breaks up, the better.\'94\
\
\'93But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma\'92s going\
away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured\
people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must\
feel that any body\'92s hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss\
Woodhouse\'92s doing it would be more thought of than any other person\'92s in\
the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am\
sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have\
been your neighbours these _ten_ years.\'94\
\
\'93No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to\
you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any\
pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole\
never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him, but\
he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means\
of giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure,\
rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a\
little longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You\
will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.\'94\
\
\'93Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no\
scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am\
only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being\
exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She loves piquet, you\
know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by\
yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea of\
that would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit\
up.\'94\
\
He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that,\
if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if\
hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should\
sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every\
thing were safe in the house, as usual.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VIII\
\
\
Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father\'92s dinner\
waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious\
for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection\
which could be concealed.\
\
He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very\
good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had\
done. He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion\
of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his spirits.\
He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him,\
Emma thus moralised to herself:--\
\
\'93I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things\
do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent\
way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.--It\
depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he is\
_not_ a trifling, silly young man. If he were, he would have done this\
differently. He would either have gloried in the achievement, or\
been ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of\
a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own\
vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly.\'94\
\
With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for\
a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by\
inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing\
how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air;\
and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were\
now seeing them together for the first time.\
\
She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr.\
Cole\'92s; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr.\
Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than\
his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.\
\
Her father\'92s comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs.\
Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty, before she left\
the house, was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after\
dinner; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her\
dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her power, by helping\
them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever\
unwilling self-denial his care of their constitution might have obliged\
them to practise during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner\
for them; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat\
it.\
\
She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole\'92s door; and was pleased to see\
that it was Mr. Knightley\'92s; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses,\
having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and\
independence, was too apt, in Emma\'92s opinion, to get about as he could,\
and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.\
She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from\
her heart, for he stopped to hand her out.\
\
\'93This is coming as you should do,\'94 said she; \'93like a gentleman.--I am\
quite glad to see you.\'94\
\
He thanked her, observing, \'93How lucky that we should arrive at the same\
moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether\
you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--You\
might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.\'94\
\
\'93Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of\
consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be\
beneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but\
with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always\
observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. _Now_ you have\
nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You\
are not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_ I shall really\
be very happy to walk into the same room with you.\'94\
\
\'93Nonsensical girl!\'94 was his reply, but not at all in anger.\
\
Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as\
with Mr. Knightley. She was received with a cordial respect which could\
not but please, and given all the consequence she could wish for.\
When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of\
admiration were for her, from both husband and wife; the son approached\
her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object,\
and at dinner she found him seated by her--and, as she firmly believed,\
not without some dexterity on his side.\
\
The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper\
unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of\
naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox\'92s family,\
the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the\
evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already,\
at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be\
general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could\
fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour.\
The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend, was\
the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of\
her that was expected to be very interesting. She listened, and found\
it well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her fancy,\
received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been\
calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had\
been struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking\
instrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the\
substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of\
surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations\
on Miss Bates\'92s, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from\
Broadwood\'92s the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and\
niece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates\'92s account,\
Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could\
possibly have ordered it--but now, they were both perfectly satisfied\
that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from\
Colonel Campbell.\
\
\'93One can suppose nothing else,\'94 added Mrs. Cole, \'93and I was only\
surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems,\
had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it.\
She knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as\
any reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse\
to surprize her.\'94\
\
Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the\
subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,\
and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were\
enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still\
listen to Mrs. Cole.\
\
\'93I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me\
more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who\
plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite\
a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine\
instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves\
a slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole,\
I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the\
drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little\
girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of\
it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not\
any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old\
spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to\
Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so\
particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself\
in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so\
obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that\
really is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure\
we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse\
may be prevailed with to try it this evening.\'94\
\
Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing\
more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole\'92s, turned\
to Frank Churchill.\
\
\'93Why do you smile?\'94 said she.\
\
\'93Nay, why do you?\'94\
\
\'93Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell\'92s being so rich\
and so liberal.--It is a handsome present.\'94\
\
\'93Very.\'94\
\
\'93I rather wonder that it was never made before.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.\'94\
\
\'93Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--which must\
now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.\'94\
\
\'93That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large for Mrs.\
Bates\'92s house.\'94\
\
\'93You may _say_ what you chuse--but your countenance testifies that your\
_thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine.\'94\
\
\'93I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for\
acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably\
suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what\
there is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can\
be?\'94\
\
\'93What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?\'94\
\
\'93Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She must\
know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and\
perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young\
woman\'92s scheme than an elderly man\'92s. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I\
told you that your suspicions would guide mine.\'94\
\
\'93If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in\
them.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the\
joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you\
know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had\
entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions\
of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either\
that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune\
to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a little\
attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without guessing\
exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for\
her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells\
to Ireland. Here, she must be leading a life of privation and penance;\
there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her\
native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might\
have passed; but what can any body\'92s native air do for them in the\
months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages would\
be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare\
say in her\'92s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though\
you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what\
they are.\'94\
\
\'93And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon\'92s\
preference of her music to her friend\'92s, I can answer for being very\
decided.\'94\
\
\'93And then, he saved her life. Did you ever hear of that?--A water\
party; and by some accident she was falling overboard. He caught her.\'94\
\
\'93He did. I was there--one of the party.\'94\
\
\'93Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for it\
seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think I should\
have made some discoveries.\'94\
\
\'93I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that\
Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught\
her.--It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock and\
alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believe it was\
half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--yet that was too\
general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be\
observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made\
discoveries.\'94\
\
The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share\
in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and\
obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table\
was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly\
right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said,\
\
\'93The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know\
a little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall\
soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.\'94\
\
\'93And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must\
conclude it to come from the Campbells.\'94\
\
\'93No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is\
not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She\
would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them. I may not have\
convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr.\
Dixon is a principal in the business.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings\
carry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed\
you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as\
paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.\
But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it\
should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in\
no other light than as an offering of love.\'94\
\
There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed\
real; he looked as if he felt it. She said no more, other subjects\
took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert\
succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the\
usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright\
silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the\
other--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news,\
and heavy jokes.\
\
The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other\
ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree\
of her own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her\
dignity and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and\
the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light,\
cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many\
alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed\
affection. There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she\
had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and\
seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say\
nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax\
did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she might have been\
glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the\
mortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in\
vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself\
beloved by the husband of her friend.\
\
In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.\
She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much in the\
secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair,\
and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the\
subject was almost immediately introduced, and she saw the blush of\
consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush\
of guilt which accompanied the name of \'93my excellent friend Colonel\
Campbell.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested\
by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her\
perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and\
to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish\
of saying as little about it as possible, which she plainly read in the\
fair heroine\'92s countenance.\
\
They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first\
of the early was Frank Churchill. In he walked, the first and the\
handsomest; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates\
and her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,\
where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her, would\
not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be thinking.\
She was his object, and every body must perceive it. She introduced him\
to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard\
what each thought of the other. \'93He had never seen so lovely a face, and\
was delighted with her naivete.\'94 And she, \'93Only to be sure it was paying\
him too great a compliment, but she did think there were some looks a\
little like Mr. Elton.\'94 Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned\
from her in silence.\
\
Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first\
glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.\
He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated\
sitting long--was always the first to move when he could--that his\
father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over\
parish business--that as long as he had staid, however, it had been\
pleasant enough, as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike,\
sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether--thought it\
so abundant in agreeable families--that Emma began to feel she had been\
used to despise the place rather too much. She questioned him as to the\
society in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe,\
and the sort; and could make out from his answers that, as far as\
Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their\
visitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and\
that even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even\
chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;\
that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though\
he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without\
considerable address _at_ _times_, that he could get away, or introduce\
an acquaintance for a night.\
\
She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at\
its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at\
home than he liked. His importance at Enscombe was very evident. He did\
not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he had persuaded his\
aunt where his uncle could do nothing, and on her laughing and noticing\
it, he owned that he believed (excepting one or two points) he could\
_with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing. One of those points on which\
his influence failed, he then mentioned. He had wanted very much to\
go abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but she\
would not hear of it. This had happened the year before. _Now_, he said,\
he was beginning to have no longer the same wish.\
\
The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed to be\
good behaviour to his father.\
\
\'93I have made a most wretched discovery,\'94 said he, after a short pause.--\
\'93I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time. I never knew days fly\
so fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself.\
But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--I hate the\
recollection.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out\
of so few, in having your hair cut.\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 said he, smiling, \'93that is no subject of regret at all. I have\
no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be\
seen.\'94\
\
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself\
obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. When\
Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored as before,\
she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss\
Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.\
\
\'93What is the matter?\'94 said she.\
\
He started. \'93Thank you for rousing me,\'94 he replied. \'93I believe I have\
been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a\
way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her. I never saw\
any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This must be a fancy of her own. I\
see nobody else looking like her!--I must go and ask her whether it\
is an Irish fashion. Shall I?--Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you\
shall see how she takes it;--whether she colours.\'94\
\
He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss\
Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,\
as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in\
front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.\
\
Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.\
\
\'93This is the luxury of a large party,\'94 said she:--\'93one can get near\
every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk\
to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like\
yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how\
Miss Bates and her niece came here?\'94\
\
\'93How?--They were invited, were not they?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their\
coming?\'94\
\
\'93They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?\'94\
\
\'93Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad\
it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and\
cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her, though I never saw\
her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she was heated, and\
would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could\
not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room,\
and I could get at him, I spoke to him about the carriage. You may guess\
how readily he came into my wishes; and having his approbation, I made\
my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her that the carriage would be\
at her service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making\
her comfortable at once. Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you\
may be sure. \'91Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!\'92--but with many,\
many thanks--\'91there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley\'92s\
carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.\'92 I was quite\
surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a\
very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing\
that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his\
usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their\
accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he would not\
have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse\
for assisting them.\'94\
\
\'93Very likely,\'94 said Emma--\'93nothing more likely. I know no man more\
likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing\
really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He is not a\
gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane\
Fairfax\'92s ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him;--and for\
an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on\
more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived\
together; and I laughed at him about it, but he said not a word that\
could betray.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Mrs. Weston, smiling, \'93you give him credit for more simple,\
disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss\
Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never\
been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable\
it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane\
Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to\
it?\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!\'94 exclaimed Emma. \'93Dear Mrs. Weston, how\
could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley must not\
marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--Oh! no,\
no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley\'92s\
marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that you\
should think of such a thing.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want\
the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--but the idea has\
been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to\
marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry\'92s account, a boy of six\
years old, who knows nothing of the matter?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--Mr.\
Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt\
it now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!\'94\
\
\'93Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you very well\
know.\'94\
\
\'93But the imprudence of such a match!\'94\
\
\'93I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability.\'94\
\
\'93I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than\
what you mention. His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell you, would\
be quite enough to account for the horses. He has a great regard for the\
Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad to\
shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.\
You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no,\
no;--every feeling revolts. For his own sake, I would not have him do so\
mad a thing.\'94\
\
\'93Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune,\
and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.\'94\
\
\'93But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he has not the\
least idea of it. Do not put it into his head. Why should he marry?--He\
is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep, and\
his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely fond of\
his brother\'92s children. He has no occasion to marry, either to fill up\
his time or his heart.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really loves\
Jane Fairfax--\'94\
\
\'93Nonsense! He does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am\
sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but--\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Mrs. Weston, laughing, \'93perhaps the greatest good he could\
do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.\'94\
\
\'93If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself; a\
very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he bear to have Miss\
Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking\
him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--\'91So very\
kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!\'92\
And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother\'92s old\
petticoat. \'91Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still\
it would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say that\
their petticoats were all very strong.\'92\'94\
\
\'93For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her. You divert me against my conscience.\
And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed\
by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him. She might talk on; and\
if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would only talk louder, and\
drown her voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad\
connexion for him, but whether he wishes it; and I think he does. I have\
heard him speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The\
interest he takes in her--his anxiety about her health--his concern that\
she should have no happier prospect! I have heard him express himself\
so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the\
pianoforte, and of her voice! I have heard him say that he could listen\
to her for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred\
to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though\
we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the\
Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting\
him. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in\
love.\'94\
\
\'93Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not\
think it is at all a likely thing for him to do. Mr. Knightley does\
nothing mysteriously.\'94\
\
\'93I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener\
than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of\
things, occur to him.\'94\
\
\'93Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told\
her so.\'94\
\
\'93There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong\
notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent when\
Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.\'94\
\
\'93You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have\
many a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment--I\
believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me that\
Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.\'94\
\
They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather\
gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most\
used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them\
that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same\
moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the\
honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her\
conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that\
he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very\
pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to\
lead, she gave a very proper compliance.\
\
She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than\
she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in\
the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany\
her own voice well. One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by\
surprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her\
pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual\
followed. He was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect\
knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing\
of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang\
together once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss\
Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could\
attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.\
\
With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the\
numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.\
They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the\
sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half\
Emma\'92s mind; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of\
Mrs. Weston\'92s suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices\
gave only momentary interruptions. Her objections to Mr. Knightley\'92s\
marrying did not in the least subside. She could see nothing but evil\
in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley;\
consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children--a most\
mortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great\
deduction from her father\'92s daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could\
not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs.\
Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never\
marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.\
\
Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her. They\
talked at first only of the performance. His admiration was certainly\
very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have\
struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his\
kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in\
the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only\
his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own.\
\
\'93I often feel concern,\'94 said she, \'93that I dare not make our carriage\
more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but\
you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to\
for such a purpose.\'94\
\
\'93Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,\'94 he\
replied;--\'93but you must often wish it, I am sure.\'94 And he smiled with\
such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another\
step.\
\
\'93This present from the Campbells,\'94 said she--\'93this pianoforte is very\
kindly given.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he replied, and without the smallest apparent\
embarrassment.--\'93But they would have done better had they given\
her notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not\
enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have\
expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell.\'94\
\
From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had\
had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were\
entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual\
preference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane\'92s\
second song, her voice grew thick.\
\
\'93That will do,\'94 said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--\'93you have\
sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.\'94\
\
Another song, however, was soon begged for. \'93One more;--they would not\
fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.\'94\
 And Frank Churchill was heard to say, \'93I think you could manage this\
without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the\
song falls on the second.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley grew angry.\
\
\'93That fellow,\'94 said he, indignantly, \'93thinks of nothing but shewing off\
his own voice. This must not be.\'94 And touching Miss Bates, who at that\
moment passed near--\'93Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing\
herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on\
her.\'94\
\
Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to\
be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther\
singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse\
and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within\
five minutes) the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew\
where--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every\
thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston,\
capital in her country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible\
waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to\
Emma, had secured her hand, and led her up to the top.\
\
While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,\
Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on\
her voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr.\
Knightley. This would be a trial. He was no dancer in general. If he\
were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur\
something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he was talking to Mrs.\
Cole--he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,\
and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.\
\
Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe; and\
she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than\
five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of\
it made it very delightful, and she found herself well matched in a\
partner. They were a couple worth looking at.\
\
Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was\
growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother\'92s\
account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again,\
they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.\
\
\'93Perhaps it is as well,\'94 said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma to\
her carriage. \'93I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid dancing\
would not have agreed with me, after yours.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IX\
\
\
Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit\
afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she\
might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must\
be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted\
the Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!--And left a\
name behind her that would not soon die away.\
\
Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two\
points on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not\
transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of\
Jane Fairfax\'92s feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it\
had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission\
to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made\
it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her\
tongue.\
\
The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and\
there she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the\
inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily\
grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practised\
vigorously an hour and a half.\
\
She was then interrupted by Harriet\'92s coming in; and if Harriet\'92s praise\
could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.\
\
\'93Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her\'92s,\
than a lamp is like sunshine.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite\
as well as she does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body\
last night said how well you played.\'94\
\
\'93Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The\
truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,\
but Jane Fairfax\'92s is much beyond it.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or\
that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole\
said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal\
about your taste, and that he valued taste much more than execution.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.\'94\
\
\'93Are you sure? I saw she had execution, but I did not know she had any\
taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.--There is no\
understanding a word of it. Besides, if she does play so very well, you\
know, it is no more than she is obliged to do, because she will have to\
teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into\
any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?\'94\
\
\'93Just as they always do--very vulgar.\'94\
\
\'93They told me something,\'94 said Harriet rather hesitatingly; \'93but it is\
nothing of any consequence.\'94\
\
Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful of its\
producing Mr. Elton.\
\
\'93They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94\
\
\'93He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him to stay to\
dinner.\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94\
\
\'93They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox. I do not know\
what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there\
again next summer.\'94\
\
\'93She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should\
be.\'94\
\
\'93She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there. He sat by her at\
dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry\
him.\'94\
\
\'93Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar\
girls in Highbury.\'94\
\
Harriet had business at Ford\'92s.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with\
her. Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in\
her present state, would be dangerous.\
\
Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always\
very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins\
and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could\
not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--Mr.\
Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the\
office-door, Mr. Cole\'92s carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a\
stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she\
could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with\
his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full\
basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling\
children round the baker\'92s little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she\
knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough\
still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with\
seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.\
\
She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons\
appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into\
Highbury;--to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the\
first place at Mrs. Bates\'92s; whose house was a little nearer\
Randalls than Ford\'92s; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their\
eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the\
agreeableness of yesterday\'92s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to\
the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call\
on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.\
\
\'93For my companion tells me,\'94 said she, \'93that I absolutely promised Miss\
Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it\
myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he says I did, I\
am going now.\'94\
\
\'93And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,\'94 said\
Frank Churchill, \'93to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--if\
you are going home.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston was disappointed.\
\
\'93I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.\'94\
\
\'93Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the\
way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me. My aunt always\
sends me off when she is shopping. She says I fidget her to death; and\
Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same. What am I to\
do?\'94\
\
\'93I am here on no business of my own,\'94 said Emma; \'93I am only waiting for\
my friend. She will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home.\
But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument.\'94\
\
\'93Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should\
have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an\
indifferent tone--what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs.\
Weston. She might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be\
palatable through her lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world\
at a civil falsehood.\'94\
\
\'93I do not believe any such thing,\'94 replied Emma.--\'93I am persuaded that\
you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but\
there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite\
otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax\'92s opinion last night.\'94\
\
\'93Do come with me,\'94 said Mrs. Weston, \'93if it be not very disagreeable to\
you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards.\
We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It\
will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it.\'94\
\
He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,\
returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates\'92s door. Emma watched them in,\
and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all\
the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain\
muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be\
it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At\
last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.\
\
\'93Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard\'92s, ma\'92am?\'94 asked Mrs.\
Ford.--\'93Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard\'92s. Only my pattern gown is at\
Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then,\
Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown\
home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better go\
to Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels,\
Mrs. Ford, could not you?\'94\
\
\'93It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two\
parcels.\'94\
\
\'93No more it is.\'94\
\
\'93No trouble in the world, ma\'92am,\'94 said the obliging Mrs. Ford.\
\
\'93Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you\
please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard\'92s--I do not know--No, I\
think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and\
take it home with me at night. What do you advise?\'94\
\
\'93That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield,\
if you please, Mrs. Ford.\'94\
\
\'93Aye, that will be much best,\'94 said Harriet, quite satisfied, \'93I should\
not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard\'92s.\'94\
\
Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs.\
Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.\
\
\'93My dear Miss Woodhouse,\'94 said the latter, \'93I am just run across to\
entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,\
and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How\
do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston\
to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.\'94\
\
\'93I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--\'94\
\
\'93Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well;\
and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad\
to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh!\
then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me\
just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so\
very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party, she cannot\
refuse.--\'91Aye, pray do,\'92 said Mr. Frank Churchill, \'91Miss Woodhouse\'92s\
opinion of the instrument will be worth having.\'92--But, said I, I shall\
be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--\'91Oh,\'92 said\
he, \'91wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;\'92--For, would you\
believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in\
the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother\'92s spectacles.--The rivet\
came out, you know, this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother had\
no use of her spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, every\
body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said\
so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,\
but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,\
then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came\
to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I,\
Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your\
mistress\'92s spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis\
sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the\
Wallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be\
uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing\
but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value\
of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?\
Only three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats\
nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened\
if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I\
say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the\
middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so\
well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took\
the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet\
him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often\
heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only\
way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We\
have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent\
apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these\
ladies will oblige us.\'94\
\
Emma would be \'93very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,\'94 and they did at\
last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,\
\
\'93How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before.\
I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane\
came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a\
little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.\'94\
\
\'93What was I talking of?\'94 said she, beginning again when they were all in\
the street.\
\
Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.\
\
\'93I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother\'92s\
spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! \'91Oh!\'92 said he,\
\'91I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind\
excessively.\'92--Which you know shewed him to be so very.... Indeed I must\
say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected,\
he very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston,\
most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could....\
\'91Oh!\'92 said he, \'91I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort\
excessively.\'92 I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out\
the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very\
obliging as to take some, \'91Oh!\'92 said he directly, \'91there is nothing\
in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking\
home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.\'92 That, you know, was so\
very.... And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they\
are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only\
we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us\
promise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so\
good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest\
sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr.\
Knightley\'92s most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and\
certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his\
trees--I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was\
always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the\
other day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating\
these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed\
them, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. \'91I\
am sure you must be,\'92 said he, \'91and I will send you another supply; for\
I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me\
keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more,\
before they get good for nothing.\'92 So I begged he would not--for really\
as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great\
many left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept\
for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more,\
so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when\
he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say\
quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite\
distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished\
I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear,\
I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William\
Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of\
apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down\
and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.\
William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see\
him. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it\
was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had; he had brought them\
all--and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did\
not seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had\
sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master\'92s profit\
than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their\
being all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be\
able to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid\
her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for\
Mrs. Hodges _would_ be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks\
were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told\
me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley\
know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very.... I wanted\
to keep it from Jane\'92s knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it\
before I was aware.\'94\
\
Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors\
walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,\
pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.\
\
\'93Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take\
care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--rather darker\
and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss\
Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss\
Smith, the step at the turning.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER X\
\
\
The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was\
tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,\
slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near\
her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,\
standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.\
\
Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy\
countenance on seeing Emma again.\
\
\'93This is a pleasure,\'94 said he, in rather a low voice, \'93coming at least\
ten minutes earlier than I had calculated. You find me trying to be\
useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed.\'94\
\
\'93What!\'94 said Mrs. Weston, \'93have not you finished it yet? you would not\
earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate.\'94\
\
\'93I have not been working uninterruptedly,\'94 he replied, \'93I have been\
assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,\
it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe. You see\
we have been wedging one leg with paper. This was very kind of you to be\
persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home.\'94\
\
He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently\
employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make\
her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready\
to sit down to the pianoforte again. That she was not immediately ready,\
Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet\
possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she\
must reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not\
but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve\
never to expose them to her neighbour again.\
\
At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the\
powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to. Mrs.\
Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma\
joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper\
discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.\
\
\'93Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,\'94 said Frank Churchill, with a\
smile at Emma, \'93the person has not chosen ill. I heard a good deal of\
Colonel Campbell\'92s taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper\
notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would\
particularly prize. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave his\
friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself. Do not you\
think so?\'94\
\
Jane did not look round. She was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had\
been speaking to her at the same moment.\
\
\'93It is not fair,\'94 said Emma, in a whisper; \'93mine was a random guess. Do\
not distress her.\'94\
\
He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little\
doubt and very little mercy. Soon afterwards he began again,\
\
\'93How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this\
occasion, Miss Fairfax. I dare say they often think of you, and wonder\
which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument\'92s coming to\
hand. Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going\
forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be the consequence\
of an immediate commission from him, or that he may have sent only\
a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon\
contingencies and conveniences?\'94\
\
He paused. She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,\
\
\'93Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,\'94 said she, in a voice of\
forced calmness, \'93I can imagine nothing with any confidence. It must be\
all conjecture.\'94\
\
\'93Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one\
conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this\
rivet quite firm. What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard\
at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold their\
tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--Miss\
Fairfax said something about conjecturing. There, it is done. I have the\
pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed\
for the present.\'94\
\
He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a\
little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss\
Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.\
\
\'93If you are very kind,\'94 said he, \'93it will be one of the waltzes we\
danced last night;--let me live them over again. You did not enjoy them\
as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. I believe you were glad we\
danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--all the worlds one ever\
has to give--for another half-hour.\'94\
\
She played.\
\
\'93What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one\
happy!--If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth.\'94\
\
She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something\
else. He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning\
to Emma, said,\
\
\'93Here is something quite new to me. Do you know it?--Cramer.--And here\
are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might\
expect. This was all sent with the instrument. Very thoughtful of\
Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music\
here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to\
have been so thoroughly from the heart. Nothing hastily done; nothing\
incomplete. True affection only could have prompted it.\'94\
\
Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;\
and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains\
of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness,\
there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the\
amusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.--This\
amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very\
reprehensible feelings.\
\
He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--Emma\
took the opportunity of whispering,\
\
\'93You speak too plain. She must understand you.\'94\
\
\'93I hope she does. I would have her understand me. I am not in the least\
ashamed of my meaning.\'94\
\
\'93But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea.\'94\
\
\'93I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me. I have now\
a key to all her odd looks and ways. Leave shame to her. If she does\
wrong, she ought to feel it.\'94\
\
\'93She is not entirely without it, I think.\'94\
\
\'93I do not see much sign of it. She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this\
moment--_his_ favourite.\'94\
\
Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr.\
Knightley on horse-back not far off.\
\
\'93Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, just to\
thank him. I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold;\
but I can go into my mother\'92s room you know. I dare say he will come\
in when he knows who is here. Quite delightful to have you all meet\
so!--Our little room so honoured!\'94\
\
She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the\
casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley\'92s attention, and every\
syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as\
if it had passed within the same apartment.\
\
\'93How d\'92 ye do?--how d\'92ye do?--Very well, I thank you. So obliged to you\
for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready\
for us. Pray come in; do come in. You will find some friends here.\'94\
\
So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in\
his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,\
\
\'93How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all, but\
particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold\
last night. How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is.\'94\
\
And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear\
her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave\
Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her head in\
steady scepticism.\
\
\'93So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,\'94\
 resumed Miss Bates.\
\
He cut her short with,\
\
\'93I am going to Kingston. Can I do any thing for you?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she\
wanted something from Kingston.\'94\
\
\'93Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for _you_?\'94\
\
\'93No, I thank you. But do come in. Who do you think is here?--Miss\
Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.\
Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said he, in a deliberating manner, \'93for five minutes, perhaps.\'94\
\
\'93And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;\
so many friends!\'94\
\
\'93No, not now, I thank you. I could not stay two minutes. I must get on\
to Kingston as fast as I can.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! do come in. They will be so very happy to see you.\'94\
\
\'93No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the\
pianoforte.\'94\
\
\'93Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last\
night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--Was not\
it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill; I never saw any\
thing equal to it.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss\
Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.\
And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should\
not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs.\
Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception,\
in England. Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say\
something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to\
hear it.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--so\
shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!\'94\
\
\'93What is the matter now?\'94\
\
\'93To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had\
a great many, and now you have not one left. We really are so shocked!\
Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You\
should not have done it, indeed you should not. Ah! he is off. He never\
can bear to be thanked. But I thought he would have staid now, and it\
would have been a pity not to have mentioned.... Well, (returning to the\
room,) I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He is\
going to Kingston. He asked me if he could do any thing....\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Jane, \'93we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was\
open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud. You must\
have heard every thing to be sure. \'91Can I do any thing for you at\
Kingston?\'92 said he; so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you\
be going?--You seem but just come--so very obliging of you.\'94\
\
Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted\
long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived\
to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could\
allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield\
gates, before they set off for Randalls.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XI\
\
\
It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been\
known of young people passing many, many months successively, without\
being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue\
either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--when the\
felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt--it\
must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.\
\
Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;\
and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded\
to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young\
people in schemes on the subject. Frank\'92s was the first idea; and his\
the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the\
difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance.\
But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how\
delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced--for\
doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane\
Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked\
aids of vanity--to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in\
to see what it could be made to hold--and then in taking the dimensions\
of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that\
Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little\
the largest.\
\
His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole\'92s\
should be finished there--that the same party should be collected,\
and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr.\
Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston\
most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance;\
and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who\
there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space\
to every couple.\
\
\'93You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss\
Coxes five,\'94 had been repeated many times over. \'93And there will be the\
two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley.\
Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and\
Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five\
couple there will be plenty of room.\'94\
\
But soon it came to be on one side,\
\
\'93But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think\
there will.\'94\
\
On another,\
\
\'93And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to\
stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.\
It will not do to _invite_ five couple. It can be allowable only as the\
thought of the moment.\'94\
\
Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother\'92s, and\
must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed _Mrs_. Gilbert\
would have danced the other evening, if she had been asked. A word was\
put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family\
of cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance\
who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple\
would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what\
possible manner they could be disposed of.\
\
The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. \'93Might not\
they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?\'94 It seemed the\
best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a\
better. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about\
the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of\
health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be\
persevered in.\
\
\'93Oh! no,\'94 said he; \'93it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not\
bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong. She would catch a dreadful cold.\
So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would\
be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do\
not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very\
thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite\
the thing. He has been opening the doors very often this evening,\
and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He does not think of the\
draught. I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not\
quite the thing!\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of\
it, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now\
closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only\
in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on\
Frank Churchill\'92s part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before\
had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured\
to be made out quite enough for ten.\
\
\'93We were too magnificent,\'94 said he. \'93We allowed unnecessary room. Ten\
couple may stand here very well.\'94\
\
Emma demurred. \'93It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be\
worse than dancing without space to turn in?\'94\
\
\'93Very true,\'94 he gravely replied; \'93it was very bad.\'94 But still he went on\
measuring, and still he ended with,\
\
\'93I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.\'94\
\
\'93No, no,\'94 said she, \'93you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful\
to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be\
dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!\'94\
\
\'93There is no denying it,\'94 he replied. \'93I agree with you exactly. A crowd\
in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures\
in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however, having\
proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be\
a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not know that--I am\
rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well.\'94\
\
Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little\
self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of\
dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.\
Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to\
pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference,\
and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their\
acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.\
\
Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered\
the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of\
the scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.\
\
\'93Well, Miss Woodhouse,\'94 he almost immediately began, \'93your inclination\
for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors\
of my father\'92s little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a\
thought of my father\'92s, which waits only your approbation to be acted\
upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances\
of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the\
Crown Inn?\'94\
\
\'93The Crown!\'94\
\
\'93Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,\
my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.\
Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful\
welcome than at Randalls. It is his own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no\
objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel.\
Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randalls\
rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you\
were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_\
to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope you\
consent?\'94\
\
\'93It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs.\
Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for\
myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that could\
be. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?\'94\
\
She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully\
comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were\
necessary to make it acceptable.\
\
\'93No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much\
worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous;\
never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they\
had better dance at Randalls. He had never been in the room at the Crown\
in his life--did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a\
very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.\'94\
\
\'93I was going to observe, sir,\'94 said Frank Churchill, \'93that one of the\
great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger\
of any body\'92s catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at\
Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but\
nobody else could.\'94\
\
\'93Sir,\'94 said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, \'93you are very much mistaken\
if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is\
extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how\
the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father\'92s house.\'94\
\
\'93From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no\
occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it\
is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon\
heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief.\'94\
\
\'93Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of\
opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never\
heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neither\
your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer\
it.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a\
window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have\
often known it done myself.\'94\
\
\'93Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I\
live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However,\
this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it\
over--but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One\
cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so\
obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what\
can be done.\'94\
\
\'93But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94 interrupted Emma, \'93there will be plenty of time for talking every\
thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at\
the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be\
so near their own stable.\'94\
\
\'93So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever\
complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could\
be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to be\
trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight.\'94\
\
\'93I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be\
under Mrs. Weston\'92s care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.\'94\
\
\'93There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who\
is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many\
years ago, when I had the measles? \'91If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to\
wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.\'92 How often have I\
heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!\'94\
\
\'93Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor\
little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have\
been very bad, but for Perry\'92s great attention. He came four times a day\
for a week. He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which\
was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope\
whenever poor Isabella\'92s little ones have the measles, she will send for\
Perry.\'94\
\
\'93My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,\'94 said Frank\
Churchill, \'93examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there\
and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you\
might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was\
desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to\
them, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing\
satisfactorily without you.\'94\
\
Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,\
engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people\
set off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs.\
Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and\
very happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he,\
finding every thing perfect.\
\
\'93Emma,\'94 said she, \'93this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places\
you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and\
forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.\'94\
\
\'93My dear, you are too particular,\'94 said her husband. \'93What does all that\
signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as\
clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our\
club-nights.\'94\
\
The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, \'93Men never know\
when things are dirty or not;\'94 and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to\
himself, \'93Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.\'94\
\
One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.\
It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom\'92s being built,\
suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was\
the only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted\
as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary\
by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable\
supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the\
purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward\
passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs.\
Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage;\
and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being\
miserably crowded at supper.\
\
Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,\
&c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched\
suggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was\
pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and\
Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of\
expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,\
\
\'93I do not think it _is_ so very small. We shall not be many, you know.\'94\
\
And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through\
the passage, was calling out,\
\
\'93You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a\
mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.\'94\
\
\'93I wish,\'94 said Mrs. Weston, \'93one could know which arrangement our guests\
in general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing\
must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, very true,\'94 cried Frank, \'93very true. You want your neighbours\'92\
opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief\
of them--the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call\
upon them? Or Miss Bates? She is still nearer.--And I do not know\
whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of\
the rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council.\
Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?\'94\
\
\'93Well--if you please,\'94 said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, \'93if you think\
she will be of any use.\'94\
\
\'93You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,\'94 said Emma. \'93She\
will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing. She\
will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting\
Miss Bates.\'94\
\
\'93But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing\
Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.\'94\
\
Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it\
his decided approbation.\
\
\'93Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at\
once. She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer\
person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates.\
We are growing a little too nice. She is a standing lesson of how to be\
happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.\'94\
\
\'93Both sir! Can the old lady?\'94...\
\
\'93The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great\
blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect.\
Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.\'94 And\
away he ran.\
\
Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,\
and her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and\
a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it\
much less than she had supposed before--indeed very trifling; and here\
ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation at\
least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and\
chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left\
as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs.\
Stokes.--Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already\
written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,\
which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to\
be.\
\
Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.\
As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer\
character,) she was truly welcome. Her approbation, at once general\
and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another\
half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms,\
some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the\
future. The party did not break up without Emma\'92s being positively\
secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without\
her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, \'93He has asked her, my\
dear. That\'92s right. I knew he would!\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XII\
\
\
One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely\
satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the granted\
term of Frank Churchill\'92s stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston\'92s\
confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the\
Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his\
fortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take\
their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were\
entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and\
hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--in her opinion, the great risk, of\
its being all in vain.\
\
Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His\
wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed.\
All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude\
generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her\
ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley\'92s provoking\
indifference about it. Either because he did not dance himself, or\
because the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he\
seemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its\
exciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement.\
To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply,\
than,\
\
\'93Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this\
trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say\
against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--Oh! yes,\
I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as\
I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins\'92s\
week\'92s account; much rather, I confess.--Pleasure in seeing\
dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--I do not know who\
does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.\
Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very\
different.\'94\
\
This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was not\
in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so\
indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball,\
for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made\
her animated--open hearted--she voluntarily said;--\
\
\'93Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball.\
What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with\
_very_ great pleasure.\'94\
\
It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred\
the society of William Larkins. No!--she was more and more convinced\
that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great\
deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side--but no\
love.\
\
Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two\
days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of\
every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his nephew\'92s\
instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell--far too unwell to do without\
him; she had been in a very suffering state (so said her husband)\
when writing to her nephew two days before, though from her usual\
unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of\
herself, she had not mentioned it; but now she was too ill to trifle,\
and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay.\
\
The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs.\
Weston, instantly. As to his going, it was inevitable. He must be gone\
within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt,\
to lessen his repugnance. He knew her illnesses; they never occurred but\
for her own convenience.\
\
Mrs. Weston added, \'93that he could only allow himself time to hurry to\
Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there\
whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him; and that he might be\
expected at Hartfield very soon.\'94\
\
This wretched note was the finale of Emma\'92s breakfast. When once it had\
been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The\
loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--and all that the young man\
might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--Such a delightful evening as\
it would have been!--Every body so happy! and she and her partner the\
happiest!--\'93I said it would be so,\'94 was the only consolation.\
\
Her father\'92s feelings were quite distinct. He thought principally of\
Mrs. Churchill\'92s illness, and wanted to know how she was treated; and as\
for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they\
would all be safer at home.\
\
Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared; but if this\
reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful look and total want\
of spirits when he did come might redeem him. He felt the going away\
almost too much to speak of it. His dejection was most evident. He\
sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing\
himself, it was only to say,\
\
\'93Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.\'94\
\
\'93But you will come again,\'94 said Emma. \'93This will not be your only visit\
to Randalls.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able to\
return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of\
all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this\
spring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--I am afraid it\
is a custom gone for ever.\'94\
\
\'93Our poor ball must be quite given up.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the\
pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,\
foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh! Miss Woodhouse,\
why are you always so right?\'94\
\
\'93Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much\
rather have been merry than wise.\'94\
\
\'93If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends\
on it. Do not forget your engagement.\'94\
\
Emma looked graciously.\
\
\'93Such a fortnight as it has been!\'94 he continued; \'93every day more\
precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making\
me less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at\
Highbury!\'94\
\
\'93As you do us such ample justice now,\'94 said Emma, laughing, \'93I will\
venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?\
Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure\
you did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in\
coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.\'94\
\
He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma\
was convinced that it had been so.\
\
\'93And you must be off this very morning?\'94\
\
\'93Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I\
must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring\
him.\'94\
\
\'93Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss\
Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates\'92s powerful, argumentative mind might have\
strengthened yours.\'94\
\
\'93Yes--I _have_ called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It\
was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained\
by Miss Bates\'92s being absent. She was out; and I felt it impossible not\
to wait till she came in. She is a woman that one may, that one _must_\
laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my\
visit, then\'94--\
\
He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.\
\
\'93In short,\'94 said he, \'93perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be\
quite without suspicion\'94--\
\
He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew\
what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely\
serious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in\
the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,\
\
\'93You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,\
then\'94--\
\
He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting\
on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner. She heard\
him sigh. It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh.\
He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments\
passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,\
\
\'93It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to\
Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm\'94--\
\
He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He was more\
in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might\
have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse\
soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed.\
\
A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr.\
Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of\
procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that\
was doubtful, said, \'93It was time to go;\'94 and the young man, though he\
might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.\
\
\'93I shall hear about you all,\'94 said he; \'93that is my chief consolation.\
I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged\
Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She has been so kind as to promise\
it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really\
interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing. In her letters\
I shall be at dear Highbury again.\'94\
\
A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest \'93Good-bye,\'94 closed the\
speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had been\
the notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry\
to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his\
absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too\
much.\
\
It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his\
arrival. Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to\
the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation\
of seeing him which every morning had brought, the assurance of his\
attentions, his liveliness, his manners! It had been a very happy\
fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common\
course of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he had\
_almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what constancy of\
affection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present\
she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious\
preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest,\
made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of\
every previous determination against it.\
\
\'93I certainly must,\'94 said she. \'93This sensation of listlessness,\
weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,\
this feeling of every thing\'92s being dull and insipid about the house!--\
I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I\
were not--for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good to\
others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank\
Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He may spend the evening\
with his dear William Larkins now if he likes.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not say\
that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have\
contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he\
was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable\
kindness added,\
\
\'93You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out\
of luck; you are very much out of luck!\'94\
\
It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest\
regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure\
was odious. She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from\
headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball\
taken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was\
charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of\
ill-health.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIII\
\
\
Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love. Her ideas\
only varied as to the how much. At first, she thought it was a good\
deal; and afterwards, but little. She had great pleasure in hearing\
Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever\
in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him, and\
quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was, how were\
his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance of his coming to\
Randalls again this spring. But, on the other hand, she could not admit\
herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed\
for employment than usual; she was still busy and cheerful; and,\
pleasing as he was, she could yet imagine him to have faults; and\
farther, though thinking of him so much, and, as she sat drawing or\
working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close\
of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing\
elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his\
side was that she _refused_ _him_. Their affection was always to subside\
into friendship. Every thing tender and charming was to mark their\
parting; but still they were to part. When she became sensible of this,\
it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of\
her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never\
to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle\
than she could foresee in her own feelings.\
\
\'93I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_,\'94 said\
she.--\'93In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is\
there any allusion to making a sacrifice. I do suspect that he is not\
really necessary to my happiness. So much the better. I certainly will\
not persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love. I\
should be sorry to be more.\'94\
\
Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.\
\
\'93_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very\
much in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection\
continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most\
inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up. Not that I\
imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto. No, if he\
had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would not have been\
so wretched. Could he have thought himself encouraged, his looks and\
language at parting would have been different.--Still, however, I must\
be on my guard. This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing\
what it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look\
upon him to be quite the sort of man--I do not altogether build upon\
his steadiness or constancy.--His feelings are warm, but I can imagine\
them rather changeable.--Every consideration of the subject, in short,\
makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I\
shall do very well again after a little while--and then, it will be a\
good thing over; for they say every body is in love once in their lives,\
and I shall have been let off easily.\'94\
\
When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and\
she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her\
at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had\
undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving\
the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the\
affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable,\
and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed\
attractive, with spirit and precision. No suspicious flourishes now of\
apology or concern; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs.\
Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast\
between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was\
just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more\
might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm\
of her own name was not wanting. _Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than\
once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a\
compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said; and in\
the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it was by any\
such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern the effect of\
her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all\
conveyed. Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these\
words--\'93I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss\
Woodhouse\'92s beautiful little friend. Pray make my excuses and adieus\
to her.\'94 This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself. Harriet was\
remembered only from being _her_ friend. His information and prospects\
as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated;\
Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he dared not yet, even in his own\
imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.\
\
Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material\
part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up and returned\
to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she could\
still do without the writer, and that he must learn to do without her.\
Her intentions were unchanged. Her resolution of refusal only grew more\
interesting by the addition of a scheme for his subsequent consolation\
and happiness. His recollection of Harriet, and the words which\
clothed it, the \'93beautiful little friend,\'94 suggested to her the\
idea of Harriet\'92s succeeding her in his affections. Was it\
impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in\
understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness\
of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the\
probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For\
Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.\
\
\'93I must not dwell upon it,\'94 said she.--\'93I must not think of it. I know\
the danger of indulging such speculations. But stranger things have\
happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it\
will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested\
friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.\'94\
\
It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet\'92s behalf, though it\
might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter\
was at hand. As Frank Churchill\'92s arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton\'92s\
engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest\
had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill\'92s\
disappearance, Mr. Elton\'92s concerns were assuming the most irresistible\
form.--His wedding-day was named. He would soon be among them again; Mr.\
Elton and his bride. There was hardly time to talk over the first letter\
from Enscombe before \'93Mr. Elton and his bride\'94 was in every body\'92s\
mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten. Emma grew sick at the sound.\
She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet\'92s\
mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength.\
With Mr. Weston\'92s ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of\
insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she had\
not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual\
approach--new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.\
\
Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the\
reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could\
give. Emma felt that she could not do too much for her, that Harriet had\
a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience; but it was heavy work\
to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed\
to, without being able to make their opinions the same. Harriet listened\
submissively, and said \'93it was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhouse\
described--it was not worth while to think about them--and she would not\
think about them any longer\'94 but no change of subject could avail, and\
the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as\
before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground.\
\
\'93Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr.\
Elton\'92s marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make _me_.\
You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into.\
It was all my doing, I know. I have not forgotten it, I assure\
you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it will\
be a painful reflection to me for ever. Do not imagine me in danger of\
forgetting it.\'94\
\
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager\
exclamation. Emma continued,\
\
\'93I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk\
less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I\
would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my\
comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your\
duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of\
others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.\
These are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very\
important--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act\
upon them. My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.\
I want you to save yourself from greater pain. Perhaps I may sometimes\
have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather what\
would be kind by me.\'94\
\
This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of\
wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really\
loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence\
of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to\
what was right and support her in it very tolerably.\
\
\'93You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--Want\
gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do\
for you!--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!\'94\
\
Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and\
manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so\
well, nor valued her affection so highly before.\
\
\'93There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,\'94 said she afterwards to\
herself. \'93There is nothing to be compared to it. Warmth and tenderness\
of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the\
clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will. It\
is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally\
beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--I have it not--but\
I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is my superior in all the\
charm and all the felicity it gives. Dear Harriet!--I would not change\
you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female\
breathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a\
hundred such--And for a wife--a sensible man\'92s wife--it is invaluable. I\
mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIV\
\
\
Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be\
interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and\
it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to\
settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or\
not pretty at all.\
\
Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make\
her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a\
point of Harriet\'92s going with her, that the worst of the business might\
be gone through as soon as possible.\
\
She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to\
which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to\
lace up her boot, without _recollecting_. A thousand vexatious thoughts\
would recur. Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was\
not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but\
she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit\
was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation\
of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to\
form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the\
nothing-meaning terms of being \'93elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.\'94\
\
She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault,\
but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--\
She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there\
was too much ease. Her person was rather good; her face not unpretty;\
but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant. Emma\
thought at least it would turn out so.\
\
As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would not\
permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners. It was an\
awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man\
had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman\
was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the\
privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to\
depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr.\
Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just\
married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had\
been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as\
little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as\
could be.\
\
\'93Well, Miss Woodhouse,\'94 said Harriet, when they had quitted the\
house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; \'93Well, Miss\
Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--Is not she\
very charming?\'94\
\
There was a little hesitation in Emma\'92s answer.\
\
\'93Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman.\'94\
\
\'93I think her beautiful, quite beautiful.\'94\
\
\'93Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown.\'94\
\
\'93I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and\
she came in his way.\'94\
\
\'93I dare say,\'94 returned Harriet, sighing again, \'93I dare say she was very\
much attached to him.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps she might; but it is not every man\'92s fate to marry the woman\
who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this\
the best offer she was likely to have.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Harriet earnestly, \'93and well she might, nobody could ever\
have a better. Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss\
Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again. He is just as\
superior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a different\
thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and\
admire him now without any great misery. To know that he has not thrown\
himself away, is such a comfort!--She does seem a charming young woman,\
just what he deserves. Happy creature! He called her \'91Augusta.\'92 How\
delightful!\'94\
\
When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see\
more and judge better. From Harriet\'92s happening not to be at Hartfield,\
and her father\'92s being present to engage Mr. Elton, she had a quarter\
of an hour of the lady\'92s conversation to herself, and could composedly\
attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that\
Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and\
thinking much of her own importance; that she meant to shine and be very\
superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert\
and familiar; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people,\
and one style of living; that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that\
her society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.\
\
Harriet would have been a better match. If not wise or refined herself,\
she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it\
might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best of\
her own set. The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the\
alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him.\
\
The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, \'93My brother\
Mr. Suckling\'92s seat;\'94--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The\
grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was\
modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed\
by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she could see or\
imagine. \'93Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the\
likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room\
at Maple Grove; her sister\'92s favourite room.\'94--Mr. Elton was appealed\
to.--\'93Was not it astonishingly like?--She could really almost fancy\
herself at Maple Grove.\'94\
\
\'93And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the\
staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house. I really\
could not help exclaiming! I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very\
delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to\
as Maple Grove. I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little\
sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who\
sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home.\
Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will\
understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like\
what one has left behind. I always say this is quite one of the evils of\
matrimony.\'94\
\
Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient\
for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.\
\
\'93So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house--the\
grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.\
The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand\
very much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse\
of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in\
mind! My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People\
who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing\
in the same style.\'94\
\
Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that\
people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the\
extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack\
an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,\
\
\'93When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you\
have overrated Hartfield. Surry is full of beauties.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that. It is the garden of England, you\
know. Surry is the garden of England.\'94\
\
\'93Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many\
counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as\
Surry.\'94\
\
\'93No, I fancy not,\'94 replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.\
\'93I never heard any county but Surry called so.\'94\
\
Emma was silenced.\
\
\'93My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer\
at farthest,\'94 continued Mrs. Elton; \'93and that will be our time for\
exploring. While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare\
say. They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four\
perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of _our_ carriage,\
we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well. They\
would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the\
year. Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their\
bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable.\
When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss\
Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr.\
Suckling is extremely fond of exploring. We explored to King\'92s-Weston\
twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their\
first having the barouche-landau. You have many parties of that kind\
here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?\'94\
\
\'93No; not immediately here. We are rather out of distance of the very\
striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we\
are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home\
than engage in schemes of pleasure.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort. Nobody can\
be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple\
Grove. Many a time has Selina said, when she has been going to Bristol,\
\'91I really cannot get this girl to move from the house. I absolutely must\
go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau\
without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will,\
would never stir beyond the park paling.\'92 Many a time has she said so;\
and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion. I think, on the contrary,\
when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very\
bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in\
a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little. I\
perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--(looking\
towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father\'92s state of health must be a great\
drawback. Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should. Let me recommend\
Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse\
good.\'94\
\
\'93My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any\
benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you,\
does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! that\'92s a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the\
waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give. In my Bath\
life, I have seen such instances of it! And it is so cheerful a place,\
that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse\'92s spirits,\
which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed. And as to its\
recommendations to _you_, I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell\
on them. The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally\
understood. It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived\
so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best\
society in the place. A line from me would bring you a little host of\
acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have\
always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any\
attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public\
with.\'94\
\
It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite. The idea\
of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an\
_introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend\
of Mrs. Elton\'92s--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the\
help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss\
Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!\
\
She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have\
given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; \'93but their going to Bath was\
quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that\
the place might suit her better than her father.\'94 And then, to prevent\
farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly.\
\
\'93I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton. Upon these occasions,\
a lady\'92s character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long known\
that you are a superior performer.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior\
performer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial\
a quarter your information came. I am doatingly fond of\
music--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid\
of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is\
_mediocre_ to the last degree. You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play\
delightfully. I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction,\
comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got\
into. I absolutely cannot do without music. It is a necessary of life to\
me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at\
Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice. I\
honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future\
home, and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be\
disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had\
been accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.\
When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that _the_\
_world_ I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of\
retirement. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was\
not necessary to _me_. I could do very well without it. To those who had\
no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite\
independent. And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I\
really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any\
sacrifice of that description. Certainly I had been accustomed to every\
luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him that two carriages were not\
necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. \'91But,\'92 said I,\
\'91to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a\
musical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life\
would be a blank to me.\'92\'94\
\
\'93We cannot suppose,\'94 said Emma, smiling, \'93that Mr. Elton would hesitate\
to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury; and\
I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be\
pardoned, in consideration of the motive.\'94\
\
\'93No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to\
find myself in such a circle. I hope we shall have many sweet little\
concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a\
musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.\
Will not it be a good plan? If _we_ exert ourselves, I think we shall\
not be long in want of allies. Something of that nature would be\
particularly desirable for _me_, as an inducement to keep me in\
practice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against\
them, in general. They are but too apt to give up music.\'94\
\
\'93But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger,\
surely?\'94\
\
\'93I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,\
I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the\
instrument--though she played sweetly. And the same may be said of Mrs.\
Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs.\
Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate. Upon my\
word it is enough to put one in a fright. I used to be quite angry with\
Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has\
many things to call her attention. I believe I was half an hour this\
morning shut up with my housekeeper.\'94\
\
\'93But every thing of that kind,\'94 said Emma, \'93will soon be in so regular a\
train--\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Mrs. Elton, laughing, \'93we shall see.\'94\
\
Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music, had nothing\
more to say; and, after a moment\'92s pause, Mrs. Elton chose another\
subject.\
\
\'93We have been calling at Randalls,\'94 said she, \'93and found them both at\
home; and very pleasant people they seem to be. I like them extremely.\
Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favourite\
with me already, I assure you. And _she_ appears so truly good--there is\
something so motherly and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one\
directly. She was your governess, I think?\'94\
\
Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly\
waited for the affirmative before she went on.\
\
\'93Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her so very\
lady-like! But she is really quite the gentlewoman.\'94\
\
\'93Mrs. Weston\'92s manners,\'94 said Emma, \'93were always particularly good.\
Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest\
model for any young woman.\'94\
\
\'93And who do you think came in while we were there?\'94\
\
Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--and\
how could she possibly guess?\
\
\'93Knightley!\'94 continued Mrs. Elton; \'93Knightley himself!--Was not it\
lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day, I had never\
seen him before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.\'92s,\
I had a great curiosity. \'91My friend Knightley\'92 had been so often\
mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him; and I must do my\
caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend.\
Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him very much. Decidedly, I\
think, a very gentleman-like man.\'94\
\
Happily, it was now time to be gone. They were off; and Emma could\
breathe.\
\
\'93Insufferable woman!\'94 was her immediate exclamation. \'93Worse than I had\
supposed. Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not have\
believed it. Knightley!--never seen him in her life before, and call\
him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman! A little upstart,\
vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her _caro_ _sposo_, and her\
resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.\
Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether\
he will return the compliment, and discover her to be a lady. I could\
not have believed it! And to propose that she and I should unite to\
form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends! And Mrs.\
Weston!--Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a\
gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her equal. Much beyond\
my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank\
Churchill say to her, if he were here? How angry and how diverted he\
would be! Ah! there I am--thinking of him directly. Always the first\
person to be thought of! How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes\
as regularly into my mind!\'94--\
\
All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time her father\
had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons\'92 departure, and was\
ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable of attending.\
\
\'93Well, my dear,\'94 he deliberately began, \'93considering we never saw her\
before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she\
was very much pleased with you. She speaks a little too quick. A little\
quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. But I believe\
I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and\
poor Miss Taylor. However, she seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved\
young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife. Though I think\
he had better not have married. I made the best excuses I could for not\
having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I\
said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer. But I ought to\
have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss. Ah! it shews\
what a sad invalid I am! But I do not like the corner into Vicarage\
Lane.\'94\
\
\'93I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir. Mr. Elton knows you.\'94\
\
\'93Yes: but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects to her\
if possible. It was being very deficient.\'94\
\
\'93But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore why\
should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_? It ought to\
be no recommendation to _you_. It is encouraging people to marry if you\
make so much of them.\'94\
\
\'93No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always\
wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially,\
is never to be neglected. More is avowedly due to _her_. A bride, you\
know, my dear, is always the first in company, let the others be who\
they may.\'94\
\
\'93Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what\
is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to\
such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.\'94\
\
\'93My dear, you do not understand me. This is a matter of mere\
common politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any\
encouragement to people to marry.\'94\
\
Emma had done. Her father was growing nervous, and could not understand\
_her_. Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton\'92s offences, and long, very long,\
did they occupy her.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XV\
\
\
Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill\
opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her observation had been pretty correct. Such as\
Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview, such she appeared\
whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant,\
and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment,\
but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior\
knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood;\
and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs.\
Elton\'92s consequence only could surpass.\
\
There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from\
his wife. He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud. He had the air\
of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury,\
as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her\
new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging,\
following the lead of Miss Bates\'92s good-will, or taking it for granted\
that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed\
herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton\'92s praise\
passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss\
Woodhouse, who readily continued her first contribution and talked with\
a good grace of her being \'93very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.\'94\
\
In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at\
first. Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by the\
little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with, she drew\
back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and\
though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was\
necessarily increasing Emma\'92s dislike. Her manners, too--and Mr.\
Elton\'92s, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and\
negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet\'92s cure; but the\
sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very\
much.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet\'92s attachment had been\
an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her own share in the story, under\
a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him,\
had in all likelihood been given also. She was, of course, the object\
of their joint dislike.--When they had nothing else to say, it must be\
always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which\
they dared not shew in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in\
contemptuous treatment of Harriet.\
\
Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not\
merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to\
recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied\
with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without\
solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and\
befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the\
third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton\'92s knight-errantry\
on the subject.--\
\
\'93Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave\
about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and\
ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she has very\
extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she plays extremely\
well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she\
is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word,\
I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--And her situation is so calculated\
to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour\
to do something for her. We must bring her forward. Such talent as hers\
must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those\
charming lines of the poet,\
\
        \'91Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,\
          \'91And waste its fragrance on the desert air.\'92\
\
We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax.\'94\
\
\'93I cannot think there is any danger of it,\'94 was Emma\'92s calm answer--\'93and\
when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax\'92s situation and\
understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I\
have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement, such\
obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed\
with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she feels it.\
I am sure she does. She is very timid and silent. One can see that she\
feels the want of encouragement. I like her the better for it. I\
must confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for\
timidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those\
who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure\
you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more\
than I can express.\'94\
\
\'93You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any of\
Miss Fairfax\'92s acquaintance here, any of those who have known her longer\
than yourself, can shew her any other attention than\'94--\
\
\'93My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to\
act. You and I need not be afraid. If _we_ set the example, many will\
follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. _We_\
have carriages to fetch and convey her home, and _we_ live in a style\
which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the\
least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to\
send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked _more_\
than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of\
thing. It is not likely that I _should_, considering what I have been\
used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the\
other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple\
Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--for we do not\
at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my\
resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--I shall certainly have\
her very often at my house, shall introduce her wherever I can, shall\
have musical parties to draw out her talents, and shall be constantly\
on the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very\
extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit\
her shortly.--I shall introduce her, of course, very particularly to my\
brother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her\
extremely; and when she gets a little acquainted with them, her fears\
will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners\
of either but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often\
indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a\
seat for her in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.\'94\
\
\'93Poor Jane Fairfax!\'94--thought Emma.--\'93You have not deserved this. You\
may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment\
beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs.\
Elton!--\'91Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.\'92 Heavens! Let me not suppose\
that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--But upon my honour,\
there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman\'92s tongue!\'94\
\
Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively\
addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a \'93dear Miss\
Woodhouse.\'94 The change on Mrs. Elton\'92s side soon afterwards appeared,\
and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular\
friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton\'92s guidance, the very active\
patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general\
way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.\
\
She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates\'92s gratitude for\
Mrs. Elton\'92s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless\
simplicity and warmth. She was quite one of her worthies--the\
most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished and\
condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma\'92s only surprize\
was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs.\
Elton as she seemed to do. She heard of her walking with the Eltons,\
sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was\
astonishing!--She could not have believed it possible that the taste or\
the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as\
the Vicarage had to offer.\
\
\'93She is a riddle, quite a riddle!\'94 said she.--\'93To chuse to remain here\
month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the\
mortification of Mrs. Elton\'92s notice and the penury of her conversation,\
rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her\
with such real, generous affection.\'94\
\
Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells\
were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had\
promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh\
invitations had arrived for her to join them there. According to Miss\
Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly.\
Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends\
contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she had\
declined it!\
\
\'93She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing\
this invitation,\'94 was Emma\'92s conclusion. \'93She must be under some sort\
of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great\
fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--She is _not_ to be\
with the _Dixons_. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she\
consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle.\'94\
\
Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before\
the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this\
apology for Jane.\
\
\'93We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,\
my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home. Her aunt is a\
good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We\
must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her taste for\
what she goes to.\'94\
\
\'93You are right, Mrs. Weston,\'94 said Mr. Knightley warmly, \'93Miss Fairfax\
is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.\
Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have chosen\
her. But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives attentions from\
Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her.\'94\
\
Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance; and she\
was herself struck by his warmth. With a faint blush, she presently\
replied,\
\
\'93Such attentions as Mrs. Elton\'92s, I should have imagined, would rather\
disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton\'92s invitations I should\
have imagined any thing but inviting.\'94\
\
\'93I should not wonder,\'94 said Mrs. Weston, \'93if Miss Fairfax were to have\
been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt\'92s eagerness in\
accepting Mrs. Elton\'92s civilities for her. Poor Miss Bates may\
very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater\
appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated, in\
spite of the very natural wish of a little change.\'94\
\
Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few\
minutes silence, he said,\
\
\'93Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton does\
not talk _to_ Miss Fairfax as she speaks _of_ her. We all know the\
difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest spoken\
amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common\
civility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something more\
early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we\
may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently.\
And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be\
sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind\
and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the\
respect which she has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably\
never fell in Mrs. Elton\'92s way before--and no degree of vanity can\
prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if\
not in consciousness.\'94\
\
\'93I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,\'94 said Emma. Little Henry\
was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her\
irresolute what else to say.\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 he replied, \'93any body may know how highly I think of her.\'94\
\
\'93And yet,\'94 said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon\
stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--she hurried\
on--\'93And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it\
is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or\
other.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick\
leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or\
some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,\
\
\'93Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me\
a hint of it six weeks ago.\'94\
\
He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not\
herself know what to think. In a moment he went on--\
\
\'93That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare\
say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very sure I shall\
never ask her.\'94\
\
Emma returned her friend\'92s pressure with interest; and was pleased\
enough to exclaim,\
\
\'93You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you.\'94\
\
He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner which\
shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,\
\
\'93So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?\'94\
\
\'93No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making,\
for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now,\
meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any\
idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest\
wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come\
in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his reverie was, \'93No,\
Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take\
me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way, I assure\
you.\'94 And soon afterwards, \'93Jane Fairfax is a very charming young\
woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She has a fault. She has\
not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.\'94\
\
Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault. \'93Well,\'94 said\
she, \'93and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, very soon. He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;\
he asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or\
wittier than his neighbours.\'94\
\
\'93In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and\
wittier than all the world! I wonder how she speaks of the Coles--what\
she calls them! How can she find any appellation for them, deep enough\
in familiar vulgarity? She calls you, Knightley--what can she do for\
Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts\
her civilities and consents to be with her. Mrs. Weston, your argument\
weighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation\
of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of\
Miss Fairfax\'92s mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton\'92s\
acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her\
being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding.\
I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor\
with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not be\
continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring her\
a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring\
parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.\'94\
\
\'93Jane Fairfax has feeling,\'94 said Mr. Knightley--\'93I do not accuse her\
of want of feeling. Her sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and her\
temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control;\
but it wants openness. She is reserved, more reserved, I think, than\
she used to be--And I love an open temper. No--till Cole alluded to my\
supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax\
and conversed with her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no\
thought beyond.\'94\
\
\'93Well, Mrs. Weston,\'94 said Emma triumphantly when he left them, \'93what do\
you say now to Mr. Knightley\'92s marrying Jane Fairfax?\'94\
\
\'93Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied by the\
idea of _not_ being in love with her, that I should not wonder if it\
were to end in his being so at last. Do not beat me.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVI\
\
\
Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was\
disposed to pay him attention on his marriage. Dinner-parties and\
evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations flowed\
in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were\
never to have a disengaged day.\
\
\'93I see how it is,\'94 said she. \'93I see what a life I am to lead among you.\
Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite\
the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very\
formidable. From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a\
disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have\
been at a loss.\'94\
\
No invitation came amiss to her. Her Bath habits made evening-parties\
perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste for\
dinners. She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at\
the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury\
card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a\
good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she would soon shew\
them how every thing ought to be arranged. In the course of the spring\
she must return their civilities by one very superior party--in which\
her card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and\
unbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the\
evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the\
refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.\
\
Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at\
Hartfield for the Eltons. They must not do less than others, or she\
should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful\
resentment. A dinner there must be. After Emma had talked about it for\
ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the\
usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself,\
with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him.\
\
The persons to be invited, required little thought. Besides the\
Eltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of\
course--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must\
be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with\
equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased\
by Harriet\'92s begging to be allowed to decline it. \'93She would rather not\
be in his company more than she could help. She was not yet quite\
able to see him and his charming happy wife together, without feeling\
uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she would\
rather stay at home.\'94 It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had\
she deemed it possible enough for wishing. She was delighted with the\
fortitude of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to\
give up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the\
very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--\
Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she\
was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had often\
been.--Mr. Knightley\'92s words dwelt with her. He had said that Jane\
Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her.\
\
\'93This is very true,\'94 said she, \'93at least as far as relates to me, which\
was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--and\
always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--She will\
never like me now. I have neglected her too long. But I will shew her\
greater attention than I have done.\'94\
\
Every invitation was successful. They were all disengaged and all\
happy.--The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet\
over. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred. The two eldest little\
Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some\
weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and\
staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day\
of this party.--His professional engagements did not allow of his being\
put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening\
so. Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the\
utmost that his nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma\
apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not\
being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without\
falling in with a dinner-party.\
\
She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself, by\
representing that though he certainly would make them nine, yet\
he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very\
immaterial. She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to\
have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her\
instead of his brother.\
\
The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John\
Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and\
must be absent on the very day. He might be able to join them in the\
evening, but certainly not to dinner. Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease;\
and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys and the\
philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate, removed the\
chief of even Emma\'92s vexation.\
\
The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John\
Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being\
agreeable. Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they\
waited for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton,\
as elegant as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in\
silence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella\'92s information--but\
Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could talk\
to her. He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk\
with his little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain. It was\
natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,\
\
\'93I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am\
sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time. I hope you\
turned directly.\'94\
\
\'93I went only to the post-office,\'94 said she, \'93and reached home before the\
rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when\
I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out. A walk\
before breakfast does me good.\'94\
\
\'93Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.\'94\
\
\'93No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.\'94\
\
Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,\
\
\'93That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards\
from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry\
and John had seen more drops than they could count long before. The\
post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. When you have\
lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going\
through the rain for.\'94\
\
There was a little blush, and then this answer,\
\
\'93I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every\
dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing\
older should make me indifferent about letters.\'94\
\
\'93Indifferent! Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.\
Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very\
positive curse.\'94\
\
\'93You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of\
friendship.\'94\
\
\'93I have often thought them the worst of the two,\'94 replied he coolly.\
\'93Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well--I am\
very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body. I\
can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than\
to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which\
makes the difference, it is not age, but situation. You have every\
body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again;\
and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office,\
I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than\
to-day.\'94\
\
\'93When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,\'94\
 said John Knightley, \'93I meant to imply the change of situation which\
time usually brings. I consider one as including the other. Time will\
generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily\
circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you. As an old\
friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence\
you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.\'94\
\
It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. A pleasant \'93thank\
you\'94 seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear\
in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh. Her attention was\
now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such\
occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particular\
compliments to the ladies, was ending with her--and with all his mildest\
urbanity, said,\
\
\'93I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning\
in the rain. Young ladies should take care of themselves.--Young ladies\
are delicate plants. They should take care of their health and their\
complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind\
solicitude about me.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--I\
hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well. They are some of my very\
old friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You\
do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure. My daughter and I\
are both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest\
satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.\'94\
\
The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he\
had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.\
\
By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her\
remonstrances now opened upon Jane.\
\
\'93My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in the\
rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you do\
such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.\'94\
\
Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.\
\
\'93Oh! do not tell _me_. You really are a very sad girl, and do not know\
how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed! Mrs. Weston,\
did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our\
authority.\'94\
\
\'93My advice,\'94 said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, \'93I certainly do\
feel tempted to give. Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--Liable\
as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly\
careful, especially at this time of year. The spring I always think\
requires more than common care. Better wait an hour or two, or even\
half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough\
again. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too\
reasonable. You look as if you would not do such a thing again.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again,\'94 eagerly rejoined Mrs.\
Elton. \'93We will not allow her to do such a thing again:\'94--and nodding\
significantly--\'93there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.\
I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches our letters every morning\
(one of our men, I forget his name) shall inquire for yours too and\
bring them to you. That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from\
_us_ I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept\
such an accommodation.\'94\
\
\'93You are extremely kind,\'94 said Jane; \'93but I cannot give up my early\
walk. I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk\
somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have\
scarcely ever had a bad morning before.\'94\
\
\'93My dear Jane, say no more about it. The thing is determined, that is\
(laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine any thing\
without the concurrence of my lord and master. You know, Mrs. Weston,\
you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves. But I do flatter\
myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I\
meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as\
settled.\'94\
\
\'93Excuse me,\'94 said Jane earnestly, \'93I cannot by any means consent to such\
an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant. If the errand\
were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am\
not here, by my grandmama\'92s.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to\
employ our men.\'94\
\
Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead of\
answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.\
\
\'93The post-office is a wonderful establishment!\'94 said she.--\'93The\
regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do,\
and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!\'94\
\
\'93It is certainly very well regulated.\'94\
\
\'93So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! So seldom that\
a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the\
kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose,\
actually lost! And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad\
hands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.\'94\
\
\'93The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness\
of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther\
explanation,\'94 continued he, smiling, \'93they are paid for it. That is\
the key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served\
well.\'94\
\
The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual\
observations made.\
\
\'93I have heard it asserted,\'94 said John Knightley, \'93that the same sort\
of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master\
teaches, it is natural enough. But for that reason, I should imagine\
the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very\
little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can\
get. Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not\
always known their writing apart.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said his brother hesitatingly, \'93there is a likeness. I know what\
you mean--but Emma\'92s hand is the strongest.\'94\
\
\'93Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,\'94 said Mr. Woodhouse; \'93and\
always did. And so does poor Mrs. Weston\'94--with half a sigh and half a\
smile at her.\
\
\'93I never saw any gentleman\'92s handwriting\'94--Emma began, looking also at\
Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending\
to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect, \'93Now, how am\
I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking his name at once\
before all these people? Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout\
phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that\
would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce\
his name without the smallest distress. I certainly get better and\
better.--Now for it.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--\'93Mr. Frank Churchill\
writes one of the best gentleman\'92s hands I ever saw.\'94\
\
\'93I do not admire it,\'94 said Mr. Knightley. \'93It is too small--wants\
strength. It is like a woman\'92s writing.\'94\
\
This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him against\
the base aspersion. \'93No, it by no means wanted strength--it was not a\
large hand, but very clear and certainly strong. Had not Mrs. Weston any\
letter about her to produce?\'94 No, she had heard from him very lately,\
but having answered the letter, had put it away.\
\
\'93If we were in the other room,\'94 said Emma, \'93if I had my writing-desk, I\
am sure I could produce a specimen. I have a note of his.--Do not you\
remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you one day?\'94\
\
\'93He chose to say he was employed\'94--\
\
\'93Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince\
Mr. Knightley.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,\'94 said Mr.\
Knightley dryly, \'93writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he will, of\
course, put forth his best.\'94\
\
Dinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to, was\
ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be\
allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--\
\
\'93Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way.\'94\
\
Jane\'92s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.\
She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether\
the wet walk of this morning had produced any. She suspected that it\
_had_; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full\
expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been\
in vain. She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual--a\
glow both of complexion and spirits.\
\
She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the\
expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue\'92s end--but she\
abstained. She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt\
Jane Fairfax\'92s feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the\
room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the\
beauty and grace of each.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVII\
\
\
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it\
hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--with so\
much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross\
Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She and Mrs. Weston were obliged to\
be almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton\
left them no choice. If Jane repressed her for a little time, she\
soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a\
half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton\'92s side, there was no avoiding\
a knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office--catching\
cold--fetching letters--and friendship, were long under discussion;\
and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant\
to Jane--inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to\
suit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton\'92s meditated activity.\
\
\'93Here is April come!\'94 said she, \'93I get quite anxious about you. June\
will soon be here.\'94\
\
\'93But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked\
forward to the summer in general.\'94\
\
\'93But have you really heard of nothing?\'94\
\
\'93I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the\
difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.\'94\
\
\'93I not aware!\'94 said Jane, shaking her head; \'93dear Mrs. Elton, who can\
have thought of it as I have done?\'94\
\
\'93But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know\
how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations. I saw\
a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of\
Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every\
body was anxious to be in her family, for she moves in the first circle.\
Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all\
houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge\'92s is the one I would most wish to see\
you in.\'94\
\
\'93Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,\'94\
 said Jane. \'93I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want\
it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would\
not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present.\'94\
\
\'93Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me\
trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be\
more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in\
a day or two, and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look-out\
for any thing eligible.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to\
her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body\
trouble.\'94\
\
\'93But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June,\
or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before\
us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve,\
and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence,\
is not obtained at a moment\'92s notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin\
inquiring directly.\'94\
\
\'93Excuse me, ma\'92am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no\
inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When\
I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being\
long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry\
would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--not quite of human\
flesh--but of human intellect.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at\
the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to\
the abolition.\'94\
\
\'93I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,\'94 replied Jane;\
\'93governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely\
different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to\
the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But\
I only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by\
applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with\
something that would do.\'94\
\
\'93Something that would do!\'94 repeated Mrs. Elton. \'93Aye, _that_ may suit\
your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature you are;\
but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any\
thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family\
not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of\
life.\'94\
\
\'93You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;\
it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I\
think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.\
A gentleman\'92s family is all that I should condition for.\'94\
\
\'93I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall\
be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite\
on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the\
first circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name\
your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family\
as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--if you knew the harp, you\
might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;--yes, I\
really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what\
you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and\
comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.\'94\
\
\'93You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such\
a situation together,\'94 said Jane, \'93they are pretty sure to be equal;\
however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted\
at present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am\
obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing\
nothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I\
shall remain where I am, and as I am.\'94\
\
\'93And I am quite serious too, I assure you,\'94 replied Mrs. Elton gaily,\
\'93in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to\
watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.\'94\
\
In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr.\
Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change of object,\
and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,\
\
\'93Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his\
gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature\
he is;--I assure you I like him excessively. I admire all that quaint,\
old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;\
modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish\
you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I\
began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I\
am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown. How do you like\
it?--Selina\'92s choice--handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it\
is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being\
over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments\
now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like\
a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style\
of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the\
minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show\
and finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a\
trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will\
look well?\'94\
\
The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr.\
Weston made his appearance among them. He had returned to a late dinner,\
and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He had been too much\
expected by the best judges, for surprize--but there was great joy. Mr.\
Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now, as he would have been sorry\
to see him before. John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--That\
a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day\
of business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile\
to another man\'92s house, for the sake of being in mixed company till\
bed-time, of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise\
of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him deeply. A man who had been\
in motion since eight o\'92clock in the morning, and might now have been\
still, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had\
been in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man, to\
quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside, and on the\
evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world!--Could\
he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife, there\
would have been a motive; but his coming would probably prolong rather\
than break up the party. John Knightley looked at him with amazement,\
then shrugged his shoulders, and said, \'93I could not have believed it\
even of _him_.\'94\
\
Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was\
exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being\
principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was\
making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the\
inquiries of his wife as to his dinner, convincing her that none of all\
her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread\
abroad what public news he had heard, was proceeding to a family\
communication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he\
had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in\
the room. He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he\
had met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.\
\
\'93Read it, read it,\'94 said he, \'93it will give you pleasure; only a few\
lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.\'94\
\
The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking\
to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to\
every body.\
\
\'93Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say\
to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon, did not I?--Anne,\
my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?--In\
town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say; for _she_ is as\
impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most\
likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her illness, all\
nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us\
again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come,\
and he will be half his time with us. This is precisely what I wanted.\
Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read\
it all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some\
other time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the\
circumstance to the others in a common way.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her looks\
and words had nothing to restrain them. She was happy, she knew she was\
happy, and knew she ought to be happy. Her congratulations were warm and\
open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. _She_ was a little occupied\
in weighing her own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her\
agitation, which she rather thought was considerable.\
\
Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative\
to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,\
and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial\
communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.\
\
It was well that he took every body\'92s joy for granted, or he might\
not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly\
delighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to\
be made happy;--from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but\
she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have\
been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs.\
Elton, and her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject\
with her.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVIII\
\
\
\'93I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,\'94\
 said Mr. Weston.\
\
Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her\
by such a hope, smiled most graciously.\
\
\'93You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,\'94 he\
continued--\'93and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance. I am sure Mr.\
Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we shall both have great\
pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage.\'94\
\
\'93You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--\
He is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a\
letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my\
son\'92s hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed to me--it\
was to Mrs. Weston. She is his principal correspondent, I assure you. I\
hardly ever get a letter.\'94\
\
\'93And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her! Oh! Mr.\
Weston--(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most\
dangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours\
follow your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we\
married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh! Mr. Weston, I could\
not have believed it of you!\'94\
\
\'93Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs.\
Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in a hurry,\
merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all coming up to\
town directly, on Mrs. Churchill\'92s account--she has not been well the\
whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--so they are all to\
move southward without loss of time.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a\
considerable journey.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than\
from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people\
of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr.\
Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me--but twice\
in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four\
horses.\'94\
\
\'93The evil of the distance from Enscombe,\'94 said Mr. Weston, \'93is, that\
Mrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the\
sofa for a week together. In Frank\'92s last letter she complained, he\
said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having\
both his arm and his uncle\'92s! This, you know, speaks a great degree of\
weakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she means to\
sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word. Certainly,\
delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You\
must grant me that.\'94\
\
\'93No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my\
own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice--You will find me a formidable\
antagonist on that point. I always stand up for women--and I assure you,\
if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you\
would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill\'92s making incredible exertions to\
avoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her--and I believe I have\
caught a little of her nicety. She always travels with her own sheets;\
an excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?\'94\
\
\'93Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine\
lady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land\
for\'94--\
\
Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,\
\
\'93Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure\
you. Do not run away with such an idea.\'94\
\
\'93Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough\
a fine lady as any body ever beheld.\'94\
\
Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.\
It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was\
_not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of\
it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr.\
Weston went on.\
\
\'93Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--but\
this is quite between ourselves. She is very fond of Frank, and\
therefore I would not speak ill of her. Besides, she is out of health\
now; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would\
not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs.\
Churchill\'92s illness.\'94\
\
\'93If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath, or to\
Clifton?\'94 \'93She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for\
her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe. She has now\
been a longer time stationary there, than she ever was before, and she\
begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very\
retired.\'94\
\
\'93Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from\
the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You\
seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--And\
Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy\
that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough in\
herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot\
have too many resources--and I feel very thankful that I have so many\
myself as to be quite independent of society.\'94\
\
\'93Frank was here in February for a fortnight.\'94\
\
\'93So I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society\
of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call\
myself an addition. But perhaps he may never have heard of there being\
such a creature in the world.\'94\
\
This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr.\
Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,\
\
\'93My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible.\
Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston\'92s letters lately have been full\
of very little else than Mrs. Elton.\'94\
\
He had done his duty and could return to his son.\
\
\'93When Frank left us,\'94 continued he, \'93it was quite uncertain when we\
might see him again, which makes this day\'92s news doubly welcome. It has\
been completely unexpected. That is, _I_ always had a strong persuasion\
he would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn\
up--but nobody believed me. He and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully\
desponding. \'91How could he contrive to come? And how could it be supposed\
that his uncle and aunt would spare him again?\'92 and so forth--I always\
felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see.\
I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things\
are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.\'94\
\
\'93Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to\
a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because\
things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity\
which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that\
he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen\'92s saffron robe\
would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those\
gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views! The carriage--we had\
disappointments about the carriage;--one morning, I remember, he came to\
me quite in despair.\'94\
\
She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly\
seized the opportunity of going on.\
\
\'93You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill\
is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than\
Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable\
prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--precisely the\
season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at\
the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and\
never too hot for exercise. When he was here before, we made the best\
of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather;\
there always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we\
intended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I\
do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the\
sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or\
to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than\
having him actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the\
state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be\
pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He is generally\
thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston\'92s\
partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most\
gratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him.\'94\
\
\'93And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion\
will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr.\
Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one\
of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly\
guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall\
judge of him.--I am no flatterer.\'94\
\
Mr. Weston was musing.\
\
\'93I hope,\'94 said he presently, \'93I have not been severe upon poor Mrs.\
Churchill. If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice; but\
there are some traits in her character which make it difficult for me to\
speak of her with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant,\
Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have\
met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid\
to her. She was the instigator. Frank\'92s mother would never have been\
slighted as she was but for her. Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride\
is nothing to his wife\'92s: his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort\
of pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless\
and tiresome; but her pride is arrogance and insolence! And what\
inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.\
She was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman;\
but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill\'92d\
them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is\
an upstart.\'94\
\
\'93Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite\
a horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to\
people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who\
are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give\
themselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them\
directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and\
encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs,\
and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.\
A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West\
Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from\
Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston.\
One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something\
direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the\
Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and\
yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to\
my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest\
neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven\
years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him--I\
believe, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed\
the purchase before his death.\'94\
\
They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having\
said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.\
\
After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr.\
Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers,\
and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed\
little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which\
nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself in a worry of spirits\
which would have made her prefer being silent.\
\
Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to\
leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--\
\
\'93Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the\
boys; but you have your sister\'92s letter, and every thing is down at full\
length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than\
her\'92s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to\
recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic\
them.\'94\
\
\'93I rather hope to satisfy you both,\'94 said Emma, \'93for I shall do all\
in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and\
happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.\'94\
\
\'93And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.\'94\
\
\'93That is very likely. You think so, do not you?\'94\
\
\'93I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--or even\
may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to\
increase as much as they have done lately.\'94\
\
\'93Increase!\'94\
\
\'93Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a\
great difference in your way of life.\'94\
\
\'93Difference! No indeed I am not.\'94\
\
\'93There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than\
you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only\
one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--When did it happen\
before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you\
mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought\
an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole\'92s, or balls at the\
Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your\
goings-on, is very great.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said his brother quickly, \'93it is Randalls that does it all.\'94\
\
\'93Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less\
influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that\
Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only beg\
you to send them home.\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94 cried Mr. Knightley, \'93that need not be the consequence. Let them\
be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.\'94\
\
\'93Upon my word,\'94 exclaimed Emma, \'93you amuse me! I should like to know how\
many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of\
the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to\
attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine--what have\
they been? Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball talked of,\
which never took place. I can understand you--(nodding at Mr. John\
Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at\
once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to\
Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from\
Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I\
cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt\
Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better\
with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she\
is absent one--and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself\
or settling his accounts.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without\
difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton\'92s beginning to talk to him.\

VOLUME III\
\
\
\
CHAPTER I\
\
\
A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the\
nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She\
was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all\
apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him. Her own attachment had\
really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--but\
if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the\
two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had\
taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two\
months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils before\
her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary. She did\
not mean to have her own affections entangled again, and it would be\
incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.\
\
She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.\
That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present\
acquaintance! and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something\
decisive. She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a\
crisis, an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil\
state.\
\
It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,\
before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill\'92s\
feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been\
imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards. He rode down\
for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came from\
Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all her quick\
observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced, and how she\
must act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt\
of his great pleasure in seeing her. But she had an almost instant doubt\
of his caring for her as he had done, of his feeling the same tenderness\
in the same degree. She watched him well. It was a clear thing he was\
less in love than he had been. Absence, with the conviction probably\
of her indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable\
effect.\
\
He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed\
delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories: and he\
was not without agitation. It was not in his calmness that she read\
his comparative difference. He was not calm; his spirits were evidently\
fluttered; there was restlessness about him. Lively as he was, it seemed\
a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her belief\
on the subject, was his staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying\
away to make other calls in Highbury. \'93He had seen a group of old\
acquaintance in the street as he passed--he had not stopped, he would\
not stop for more than a word--but he had the vanity to think they would\
be disappointed if he did not call, and much as he wished to stay longer\
at Hartfield, he must hurry off.\'94 She had no doubt as to his being less\
in love--but neither his agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed\
like a perfect cure; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a\
dread of her returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting\
himself with her long.\
\
This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.\
He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented. His\
aunt could not bear to have him leave her. Such was his own account at\
Randall\'92s. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come, it was\
to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill\'92s removal to London had been of no\
service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder. That she was\
really ill was very certain; he had declared himself convinced of it, at\
Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he could not doubt, when he looked\
back, that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a\
year ago. He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care\
and medicine might not remove, or at least that she might not have many\
years of existence before her; but he could not be prevailed on, by all\
his father\'92s doubts, to say that her complaints were merely imaginary,\
or that she was as strong as ever.\
\
It soon appeared that London was not the place for her. She could\
not endure its noise. Her nerves were under continual irritation and\
suffering; and by the ten days\'92 end, her nephew\'92s letter to Randalls\
communicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to\
Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of\
an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A\
ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit\
expected from the change.\
\
Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,\
and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months\
before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for the\
house was taken for May and June. She was told that now he wrote with\
the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he\
could even wish.\
\
Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He was\
considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered. She\
hoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.\
\
Mr. Weston\'92s own happiness was indisputable. He was quite delighted.\
It was the very circumstance he could have wished for. Now, it would be\
really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to\
a young man?--An hour\'92s ride. He would be always coming over. The\
difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make\
the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never. Sixteen\
miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--was\
a serious obstacle. Were he ever able to get away, the day would be\
spent in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him in\
London; he might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very\
distance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!\
\
One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this\
removal,--the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before,\
but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now,\
however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and\
very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from\
Frank, to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change, and\
that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at\
any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.\
\
Mr. Weston\'92s ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood\
between the young people of Highbury and happiness.\
\
Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him.\
May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to\
spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he sanguinely\
hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any\
thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER II\
\
\
No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached,\
the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank\
Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls before\
dinner, and every thing was safe.\
\
No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room\
at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a\
common meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his\
entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves,\
for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of\
the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him,\
and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man\'92s company.\
She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the\
Randalls party just sufficiently before them.\
\
Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not\
say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening.\
They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should\
be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another\
carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great\
surprize. \'93So unreasonably early!\'94 she was going to exclaim; but she\
presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming,\
like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston\'92s judgment; and\
they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins,\
who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing\
earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company\
might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory\
inspection.\
\
Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston\
depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man\
who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first\
distinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but\
a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher\
character.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a\
man what he ought to be.--She could fancy such a man. The whole party\
walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing\
else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe\
in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though\
_May_, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.\
\
Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston\'92s fault that the number of privy\
councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates\'92s door\
to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be\
brought by the Eltons.\
\
Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,\
which shewed a mind not at ease. He was looking about, he was going to\
the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient\
to begin, or afraid of being always near her.\
\
Mrs. Elton was spoken of. \'93I think she must be here soon,\'94 said he. \'93I\
have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her.\
It cannot be long, I think, before she comes.\'94\
\
A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back,\
said,\
\
\'93I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her. I have never seen\
either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.\'94\
\
Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties\
passed.\
\
\'93But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!\'94 said Mr. Weston, looking about. \'93We\
thought you were to bring them.\'94\
\
The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma\
longed to know what Frank\'92s first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how\
he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress, and her smiles of\
graciousness. He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion,\
by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.\
\
In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--\'93I\
will see that there are umbrellas, sir,\'94 said Frank to his father:\
\'93Miss Bates must not be forgotten:\'94 and away he went. Mr. Weston was\
following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion\
of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself,\
though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.\
\
\'93A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you\
I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely\
pleased with him.--You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him\
a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and\
approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.\
You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--quite a horror of them.\
They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor\
me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very\
cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them\
much better.\'94\
\
While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston\'92s attention was chained; but\
when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies\
just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.\
\
Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. \'93I have no doubt of its being our\
carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so\
extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--What\
a pleasure it is to send one\'92s carriage for a friend!--I understand you\
were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.\
You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_.\'94\
\
Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into\
the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs.\
Weston\'92s to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood\
by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body\'92s words,\
were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in\
talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her\
being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she was\
heard,\
\
\'93So very obliging of you!--No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not\
care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares--Well!--(as soon\
as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed!--This is\
admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could\
not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--Jane, Jane, look!--did you\
ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin\'92s\
lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as\
I came in; she was standing in the entrance. \'91Oh! Mrs. Stokes,\'92 said\
I--but I had not time for more.\'94 She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--\'93Very\
well, I thank you, ma\'92am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear\
it. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often,\
and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed.\
Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent\
time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most\
comfortable carriage.--Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you,\
Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note,\
or we should have been.--But two such offers in one day!--Never were\
such neighbours. I said to my mother, \'91Upon my word, ma\'92am--.\'92 Thank\
you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse\'92s. I made her\
take her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--\
Mrs. Dixon\'92s wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!\
Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon\'92s choice. There were three\
others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel\
Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did\
not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but\
Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to step\
upon--I shall never forget his extreme politeness.--Oh! Mr. Frank\
Churchill, I must tell you my mother\'92s spectacles have never been in\
fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of\
your good-nature. Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank\
Churchill?--Ah! here\'92s Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do\
you do?--Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite\
in fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know\
(eyeing Emma most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word,\
Miss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane\'92s hair?--You are\
a judge.--She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her\
hair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I\
declare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a\
moment.--How do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This\
is delightful, is not it?--Where\'92s dear Mr. Richard?--Oh! there he is.\
Don\'92t disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How\
do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through\
the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway\
and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr.\
Arthur!--How do you do? How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much\
obliged to you. Never better.--Don\'92t I hear another carriage?--Who can\
this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming\
to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am\
quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A\
little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.\
Every thing so good!\'94\
\
Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss\
Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse\
of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind\
her.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not\
determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look,\
compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently\
wanting to be complimented herself--and it was, \'93How do you like\
my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--How has Wright done my\
hair?\'94--with many other relative questions, all answered with patient\
politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, \'93Nobody can think less of dress in\
general than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body\'92s\
eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have\
no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish\
to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except\
mine.--So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall\
see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.\
I like him very well.\'94\
\
At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not\
but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear\
more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till\
another suspension brought Mrs. Elton\'92s tones again distinctly\
forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,\
\
\'93Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--I was\
this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for\
tidings of us.\'94\
\
\'93Jane!\'94--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and\
displeasure.--\'93That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I\
suppose.\'94\
\
\'93How do you like Mrs. Elton?\'94 said Emma in a whisper.\
\
\'93Not at all.\'94\
\
\'93You are ungrateful.\'94\
\
\'93Ungrateful!--What do you mean?\'94 Then changing from a frown to a\
smile--\'93No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where\
is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?\'94\
\
Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked\
off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and\
Mrs. Weston. He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be\
laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton\
must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which\
interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma\
heard the sad truth with fortitude.\
\
\'93And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?\'94 said Mr. Weston.\
\'93She will think Frank ought to ask her.\'94\
\
Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and\
boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect\
approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_\
to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to\
persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs.\
Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.\
Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always\
considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make\
her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this\
time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to\
begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston\
might be his son\'92s superior.--In spite of this little rub, however,\
Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length\
of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours\
of unusual festivity before her.--She was more disturbed by Mr.\
Knightley\'92s not dancing than by any thing else.--There he was, among\
the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing,--not\
classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who\
were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were\
made up,--so young as he looked!--He could not have appeared to greater\
advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall,\
firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of\
the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body\'92s eyes;\
and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of\
young men who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,\
and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner,\
with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the\
trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but\
in general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroom\
better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--He seemed often\
observing her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of her\
dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel\
afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner.\
They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank\
Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.\
\
The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant\
attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed\
happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom\
bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in\
the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very\
recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually\
are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The two\
last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--the\
only young lady sitting down;--and so equal had been hitherto the\
number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the\
wonder!--But Emma\'92s wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton\
sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible\
to be avoided: she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him\
every moment to escape into the card-room.\
\
Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room where\
the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front\
of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining\
it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or\
speaking to those who were close to her.--Emma saw it. She was not yet\
dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore\
leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw\
it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly\
behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr.\
Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which\
just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that\
his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only\
listening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The\
kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say,\
\'93Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?\'94 to which his prompt reply was, \'93Most\
readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.\'94\
\
\'93Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no\
dancer.\'94\
\
\'93If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,\'94 said he, \'93I shall have great\
pleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old\
married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very\
great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs.\
Gilbert.\'94\
\
\'93Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady\
disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.\'94 \'93Miss\
Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I\
were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.\
You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your\
command--but my dancing days are over.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and\
mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton! the\
amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--She looked round for a moment; he\
had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself\
for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him\
and his wife.\
\
She would not look again. Her heart was in a glow, and she feared her\
face might be as hot.\
\
In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley leading\
Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized, seldom more\
delighted, than at that instant. She was all pleasure and gratitude,\
both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him; and though\
too distant for speech, her countenance said much, as soon as she could\
catch his eye again.\
\
His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it, extremely good;\
and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for\
the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment\
and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features\
announced. It was not thrown away on her, she bounded higher than ever,\
flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.\
\
Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very\
foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though\
growing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing\
audibly to her partner,\
\
\'93Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very good-natured,\
I declare.\'94\
\
Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from\
that moment, without interruption, till her being seated at table and\
taking up her spoon.\
\
\'93Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mrs.\
Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She says she is afraid there will\
be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One door\
nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane, indeed you must.\
Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--so\
gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!--Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I\
said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and\
nobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.\
Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a\
vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits\
and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some\
of her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were\
amused, and who were your partners. \'91Oh!\'92 said I, \'91I shall not forestall\
Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell\
you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,\
I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.\'92 My dear\
sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am\
not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and\
me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is\
going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we\
all follow in her train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we\
are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no,\
there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd!\
I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any\
thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling\
you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--The\
baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there\
was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at\
first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled\
enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves\
better than sweetbread and asparagus--so she was rather disappointed,\
but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of\
its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much\
concerned!--Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have\
supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing\
like it since--Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere,\
so that Jane is not in a draught. Where _I_ sit is of no consequence.\
Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--only\
it seems too good--but just as you please. What you direct in this house\
cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes\
for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but\
it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.\'94\
\
Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper;\
but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her eyes invited\
him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked. He was warm in his\
reprobation of Mr. Elton\'92s conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness;\
and Mrs. Elton\'92s looks also received the due share of censure.\
\
\'93They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,\'94 said he. \'93Emma, why is it\
that they are your enemies?\'94\
\
He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added,\
\'93_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may\
be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma,\
that you did want him to marry Harriet.\'94\
\
\'93I did,\'94 replied Emma, \'93and they cannot forgive me.\'94\
\
He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he\
only said,\
\
\'93I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections.\'94\
\
\'93Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell\
me I am wrong?\'94\
\
\'93Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong,\
I am sure the other tells you of it.\'94\
\
\'93I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is\
a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I did not: and I\
was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet. It was through a\
series of strange blunders!\'94\
\
\'93And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the\
justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has\
chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which\
Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless\
girl--infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a\
woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected.\'94\
\
Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of\
Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.\
\
\'93Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all\
doing?--Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy!\
Every body is asleep!\'94\
\
\'93I am ready,\'94 said Emma, \'93whenever I am wanted.\'94\
\
\'93Whom are you going to dance with?\'94 asked Mr. Knightley.\
\
She hesitated a moment, and then replied, \'93With you, if you will ask\
me.\'94\
\
\'93Will you?\'94 said he, offering his hand.\
\
\'93Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are\
not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.\'94\
\
\'93Brother and sister! no, indeed.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER III\
\
\
This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable\
pleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which\
she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely\
glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the\
Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much\
alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was\
peculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few\
minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been the\
occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked forward\
to another happy result--the cure of Harriet\'92s infatuation.--From\
Harriet\'92s manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the\
ballroom, she had strong hopes. It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly\
opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior\
creature she had believed him. The fever was over, and Emma could\
harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious\
courtesy. She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for\
supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther\
requisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and\
Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer\
must be before her!\
\
She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He had told her that he\
could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he was\
to be at home by the middle of the day. She did not regret it.\
\
Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all\
to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up\
for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,\
when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she\
had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harriet\
leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince\
her that something extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked white\
and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--The iron gates and the\
front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--they were all three soon in\
the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.\
\
A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,\
and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the\
suspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted\
with the whole.\
\
Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs.\
Goddard\'92s, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and\
taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough\
for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury,\
making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became\
for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies\
had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small\
distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a\
party of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and\
Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling\
on Harriet to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at\
the top, and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.\
But poor Harriet could not follow. She had suffered very much from cramp\
after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank brought on such\
a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--and in this state, and\
exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged to remain.\
\
How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more\
courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could\
not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children,\
headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent\
in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, she\
immediately promised them money, and taking out her purse, gave them a\
shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her ill.--She\
was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but her\
terror and her purse were too tempting, and she was followed, or rather\
surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.\
\
In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling and\
conditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his\
leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance\
at this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced\
him to walk forward, and leave his horses to meet him by another road,\
a mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pair\
of scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to\
restore them, he had been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a\
few minutes: he was therefore later than he had intended; and being\
on foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The\
terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then\
their own portion. He had left them completely frightened; and Harriet\
eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak, had just strength\
enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits were quite overcome.\
It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield: he had thought of no other\
place.\
\
This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and of\
Harriet\'92s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--He dared\
not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays left him\
not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her\
safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people\
in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he set off, with all the grateful\
blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself.\
\
Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman\
thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain\
ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at\
least. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician\
have seen what she did, have witnessed their appearance together, and\
heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been\
at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much\
more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and\
foresight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her\
mind had already made.\
\
It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever\
occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory; no\
rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very\
person, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing\
to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And\
knowing, as she did, the favourable state of mind of each at this\
period, it struck her the more. He was wishing to get the better of his\
attachment to herself, she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.\
It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting\
consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence should not be\
strongly recommending each to the other.\
\
In the few minutes\'92 conversation which she had yet had with him, while\
Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,\
her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a\
sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet\'92s\
own account had been given, he had expressed his indignation at the\
abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing was\
to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.\
She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she had had enough of\
interference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.\
It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she would on no account proceed.\
\
Emma\'92s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of\
what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but\
she soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour\
it was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those\
who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in\
the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last night\'92s\
ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat,\
and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their\
promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfort\
to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his\
neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss\
Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had\
the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very\
indifferent--which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,\
and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She had\
an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man,\
for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not invent\
illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.\
\
The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took\
themselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have\
walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history\
dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her\
nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and\
John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the\
gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the\
slightest particular from the original recital.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IV\
\
\
A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one\
morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down\
and hesitating, thus began:\
\
\'93Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I should\
like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, you know, it\
will be over.\'94\
\
Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a\
seriousness in Harriet\'92s manner which prepared her, quite as much as her\
words, for something more than ordinary.\
\
\'93It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,\'94 she continued, \'93to have\
no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered\
creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have\
the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is\
necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and\
I dare say you understand me.\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 said Emma, \'93I hope I do.\'94\
\
\'93How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...\'94 cried Harriet,\
warmly. \'93It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary\
in him now.--I do not care whether I meet him or not--except that of the\
two I had rather not see him--and indeed I would go any distance round\
to avoid him--but I do not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire\
her nor envy her, as I have done: she is very charming, I dare say, and\
all that, but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall\
never forget her look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss\
Woodhouse, I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,\
it will not give me another moment\'92s pang: and to convince you that I\
have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I ought to\
have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--I know that\
very well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I will destroy it\
all--and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you\
may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel\
holds?\'94 said she, with a conscious look.\
\
\'93Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?\'94\
\
\'93No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued\
very much.\'94\
\
She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_\
_precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited.\
Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within\
abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box,\
which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but,\
excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.\
\
\'93Now,\'94 said Harriet, \'93you _must_ recollect.\'94\
\
\'93No, indeed I do not.\'94\
\
\'93Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what\
passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last\
times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my\
sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--I think the\
very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new\
penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--But, as you had none\
about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took\
mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he\
cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he\
gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making\
a treasure of it--so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now\
and then as a great treat.\'94\
\
\'93My dearest Harriet!\'94 cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,\
and jumping up, \'93you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.\
Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this\
relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting the\
finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none\
about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my\
pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual\
blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--go on--what\
else?\'94\
\
\'93And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected\
it, you did it so naturally.\'94\
\
\'93And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!\'94\
 said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided\
between wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, \'93Lord\
bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a\
piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I\
never was equal to this.\'94\
\
\'93Here,\'94 resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, \'93here is something\
still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because\
this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister\
never did.\'94\
\
Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an\
old pencil,--the part without any lead.\
\
\'93This was really his,\'94 said Harriet.--\'93Do not you remember one\
morning?--no, I dare say you do not. But one morning--I forget exactly\
the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_\
_evening_, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book; it was\
about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about\
brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out\
his pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and\
it would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the\
table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I\
dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.\'94\
\
\'93I do remember it,\'94 cried Emma; \'93I perfectly remember it.--Talking\
about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we\
liked it, and Mr. Elton\'92s seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I\
perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was\
not he? I have an idea he was standing just here.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannot\
recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I\
am now.\'94--\
\
\'93Well, go on.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! that\'92s all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that\
I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see\
me do it.\'94\
\
\'93My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in\
treasuring up these things?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I\
could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you\
know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was--but\
had not resolution enough to part with them.\'94\
\
\'93But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not\
a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be\
useful.\'94\
\
\'93I shall be happier to burn it,\'94 replied Harriet. \'93It has a disagreeable\
look to me. I must get rid of every thing.--There it goes, and there is\
an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.\'94\
\
\'93And when,\'94 thought Emma, \'93will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?\'94\
\
She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already\
made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had _told_ no\
fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet\'92s.--About a fortnight\
after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite\
undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the\
information she received more valuable. She merely said, in the course\
of some trivial chat, \'93Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise\
you to do so and so\'94--and thought no more of it, till after a minute\'92s\
silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, \'93I shall never\
marry.\'94\
\
Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a\
moment\'92s debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,\
\
\'93Never marry!--This is a new resolution.\'94\
\
\'93It is one that I shall never change, however.\'94\
\
After another short hesitation, \'93I hope it does not proceed from--I hope\
it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Elton indeed!\'94 cried Harriet indignantly.--\'93Oh! no\'94--and Emma could\
just catch the words, \'93so superior to Mr. Elton!\'94\
\
She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no\
farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--Perhaps\
Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were\
totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too\
much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such\
an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly\
resolved.--She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at\
once, all that she meant to say and know. Plain dealing was always\
best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any\
application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the\
judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--She was decided,\
and thus spoke--\
\
\'93Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your\
resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from\
an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your\
superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--\
Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a\
distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of\
the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so\
proper, in me especially.\'94\
\
\'93I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you\
was enough to warm your heart.\'94\
\
\'93Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--The very\
recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--when I saw him\
coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In\
one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!\'94\
\
\'93It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.--Yes,\
honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--But that\
it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not\
advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage\
for its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be\
wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not\
let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his liking you. Be\
observant of him. Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I\
give you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on\
the subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I\
know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were very\
wrong before; we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt,\
and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but\
yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been\
matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not\
have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your\
raising your thoughts to _him_, is a mark of good taste which I shall\
always know how to value.\'94\
\
Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was\
very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend.\
Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind--and it must be\
saving her from the danger of degradation.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER V\
\
\
In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon\
Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The\
Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use\
to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her\
grandmother\'92s; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again\
delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she was likely\
to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she were able\
to defeat Mrs. Elton\'92s activity in her service, and save herself from\
being hurried into a delightful situation against her will.\
\
Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly\
taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike\
him more. He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit\
of Emma. That Emma was his object appeared indisputable. Every thing\
declared it; his own attentions, his father\'92s hints, his mother-in-law\'92s\
guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and\
indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting him\
to Emma, and Emma herself making him over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley\
began to suspect him of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He\
could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between\
them--he thought so at least--symptoms of admiration on his side, which,\
having once observed, he could not persuade himself to think entirely\
void of meaning, however he might wish to escape any of Emma\'92s errors\
of imagination. _She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose.\
He was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons\'92; and he\
had seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from\
the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he was\
again in their company, he could not help remembering what he had seen;\
nor could he avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and\
his fire at twilight,\
\
\'93Myself creating what I saw,\'94\
\
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private\
liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.\
\
He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did, to spend\
his evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he joined\
them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like\
themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the\
weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates\
and her niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on\
reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of\
visiting that would be welcome to her father, pressed them all to go in\
and drink tea with him. The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and\
after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened\
to, she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse\'92s most\
obliging invitation.\
\
As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.\
The gentlemen spoke of his horse.\
\
\'93By the bye,\'94 said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, \'93what\
became of Mr. Perry\'92s plan of setting up his carriage?\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, \'93I did not know that he ever had\
any such plan.\'94\
\
\'93Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago.\'94\
\
\'93Me! impossible!\'94\
\
\'93Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what\
was certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was\
extremely happy about it. It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she\
thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You\
must remember it now?\'94\
\
\'93Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.\'94\
\
\'93Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must have\
dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, you walk as if\
you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home.\'94\
\
\'93What is this?--What is this?\'94 cried Mr. Weston, \'93about Perry and a\
carriage? Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank? I am glad he can\
afford it. You had it from himself, had you?\'94\
\
\'93No, sir,\'94 replied his son, laughing, \'93I seem to have had it from\
nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston\'92s having\
mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all\
these particulars--but as she declares she never heard a syllable of\
it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer.\
I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gone\
through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs.\
Perry.\'94\
\
\'93It is odd though,\'94 observed his father, \'93that you should have had such\
a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you\
should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry\'92s setting up his carriage! and\
his wife\'92s persuading him to it, out of care for his health--just\
what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little\
premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!\
And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream\
certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent.\
Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?\'94\
\
Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to\
prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr.\
Weston\'92s hint.\
\
\'93Why, to own the truth,\'94 cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain\
to be heard the last two minutes, \'93if I must speak on this subject,\
there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not mean\
to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes the oddest\
dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge\
that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself\
mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as\
ourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only\
thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should\
have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning\
because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don\'92t you remember\
grandmama\'92s telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we\
had been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to\
Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed\
I do not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;\
she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go\
beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that\
I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having\
never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before\
I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and\
then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like\
Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least\
thing in the world. Where is she?--Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember\
Mrs. Perry\'92s coming.--Extraordinary dream, indeed!\'94\
\
They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley\'92s eyes had preceded Miss\
Bates\'92s in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill\'92s face, where\
he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he had\
involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind, and too busy\
with her shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited\
at the door to let her pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank\
Churchill the determination of catching her eye--he seemed watching her\
intently--in vain, however, if it were so--Jane passed between them\
into the hall, and looked at neither.\
\
There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be\
borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the\
large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and\
which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her\
father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his\
daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly,\
and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.\
\
\'93Miss Woodhouse,\'94 said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind\
him, which he could reach as he sat, \'93have your nephews taken away their\
alphabets--their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it?\
This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather\
as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one\
morning. I want to puzzle you again.\'94\
\
Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table\
was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much\
disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words\
for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness\
of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had\
often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had\
occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting,\
with tender melancholy, over the departure of the \'93poor little boys,\'94\
 or in fondly pointing out, as he took up any stray letter near him, how\
beautifully Emma had written it.\
\
Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She gave a slight\
glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to\
Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them\
all; and it was his object to see as much as he could, with as little\
apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile\
pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and\
buried from sight, she should have looked on the table instead of\
looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after\
every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to\
work. She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help. The\
word was _blunder_; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a\
blush on Jane\'92s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.\
Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be,\
was beyond his comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his\
favourite could have been so lain asleep! He feared there must be some\
decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet\
him at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and\
trick. It was a child\'92s play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank\
Churchill\'92s part.\
\
With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great alarm\
and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions. He saw a short\
word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. He\
saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining,\
though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure;\
for she said, \'93Nonsense! for shame!\'94 He heard Frank Churchill next say,\
with a glance towards Jane, \'93I will give it to her--shall I?\'94--and as\
clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. \'93No, no, you\
must not; you shall not, indeed.\'94\
\
It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without\
feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed\
over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate\
civility entreated her to study it. Mr. Knightley\'92s excessive curiosity\
to know what this word might be, made him seize every possible moment\
for darting his eye towards it, and it was not long before he saw it\
to be _Dixon_. Jane Fairfax\'92s perception seemed to accompany his;\
her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning,\
the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was\
evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed\
more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, \'93I did not\
know that proper names were allowed,\'94 pushed away the letters with even\
an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word\
that could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the\
attack, and turned towards her aunt.\
\
\'93Aye, very true, my dear,\'94 cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken\
a word--\'93I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be\
going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking\
for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good\
night.\'94\
\
Jane\'92s alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had\
preconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but\
so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley\
thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards\
her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined. She was afterwards\
looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growing\
dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley\
could not tell.\
\
He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full of\
what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his\
observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--an anxious\
friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question. He could not see her\
in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was\
his duty.\
\
\'93Pray, Emma,\'94 said he, \'93may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the\
poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the\
word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the\
one, and so very distressing to the other.\'94\
\
Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true\
explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was\
really ashamed of having ever imparted them.\
\
\'93Oh!\'94 she cried in evident embarrassment, \'93it all meant nothing; a mere\
joke among ourselves.\'94\
\
\'93The joke,\'94 he replied gravely, \'93seemed confined to you and Mr.\
Churchill.\'94\
\
He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather\
busy herself about any thing than speak. He sat a little while in\
doubt. A variety of evils crossed his mind. Interference--fruitless\
interference. Emma\'92s confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to\
declare her affection engaged. Yet he would speak. He owed it to her,\
to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference,\
rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the\
remembrance of neglect in such a cause.\
\
\'93My dear Emma,\'94 said he at last, with earnest kindness, \'93do you\
think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the\
gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?\'94\
\
\'93Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly.--Why\
do you make a doubt of it?\'94\
\
\'93Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or\
that she admired him?\'94\
\
\'93Never, never!\'94 she cried with a most open eagerness--\'93Never, for the\
twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could\
it possibly come into your head?\'94\
\
\'93I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between\
them--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be\
public.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can\
vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--very sorry\
to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will not do. There is no\
admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which\
have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances--feelings\
rather of a totally different nature--it is impossible exactly to\
explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it--but the part which is\
capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far\
from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in\
the world can be. That is, I _presume_ it to be so on her side, and I\
can _answer_ for its being so on his. I will answer for the gentleman\'92s\
indifference.\'94\
\
She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction\
which silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have\
prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his\
suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a\
circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet\
hers. He found he could not be useful, and his feelings were too much\
irritated for talking. That he might not be irritated into an absolute\
fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse\'92s tender habits required almost\
every evening throughout the year, he soon afterwards took a hasty\
leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VI\
\
\
After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs.\
Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification\
of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such\
importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at\
present. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted\
to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings\'92 coming had\
been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health\
seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs.\
Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much\
increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her neighbours was\
by the approach of it.\
\
Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal\
of pleasure and parade. Her introductions and recommendations must all\
wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she thought\
at first;--but a little consideration convinced her that every thing\
need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though\
the Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the\
autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was\
to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the\
idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what\
every body found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed\
to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the\
chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a\
quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and\
preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the\
Eltons and the Sucklings.\
\
This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but\
feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston\
that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her brother and sister had\
failed her, that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that\
as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she\
had no objection. Now, as her objection was nothing but her very great\
dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly\
aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done\
without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and\
she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which\
she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would\
probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs.\
Elton\'92s party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her\
outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her\
reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston\'92s temper.\
\
\'93I am glad you approve of what I have done,\'94 said he very comfortably.\
\'93But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without\
numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its\
own amusement. And she is a good-natured woman after all. One could not\
leave her out.\'94\
\
Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.\
\
It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton\
was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to\
pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing\
into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days,\
before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured\
on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton\'92s resources were\
inadequate to such an attack.\
\
\'93Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?\'94 she cried.--\'93And such weather\
for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What\
are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing\
done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful\
exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.\'94\
\
\'93You had better explore to Donwell,\'94 replied Mr. Knightley. \'93That may\
be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening\
fast.\'94\
\
If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so,\
for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the \'93Oh! I should like\
it of all things,\'94 was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was\
famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation:\
but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt\
the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again\
and again to come--much oftener than he doubted--and was extremely\
gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment\
as she chose to consider it.\
\
\'93You may depend upon me,\'94 said she. \'93I certainly will come. Name your\
day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?\'94\
\
\'93I cannot name a day,\'94 said he, \'93till I have spoken to some others whom\
I would wish to meet you.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am Lady\
Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me.\'94\
\
\'93I hope you will bring Elton,\'94 said he: \'93but I will not trouble you to\
give any other invitations.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraid\
of delegating power to _me_. I am no young lady on her preferment.\
Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leave\
it all to me. I will invite your guests.\'94\
\
\'93No,\'94--he calmly replied,--\'93there is but one married woman in the world\
whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and\
that one is--\'94\
\
\'93--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,\'94 interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.\
\
\'93No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage such\
matters myself.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! you are an odd creature!\'94 she cried, satisfied to have no one\
preferred to herself.--\'93You are a humourist, and may say what you\
like. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me--Jane and her\
aunt.--The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting\
the Hartfield family. Don\'92t scruple. I know you are attached to them.\'94\
\
\'93You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss\
Bates in my way home.\'94\
\
\'93That\'92s quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like. It\
is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I\
shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging\
on my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be\
more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be\
no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about\
your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under\
trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out\
of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural\
and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?\'94\
\
\'93Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have\
the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of\
gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is\
best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating\
strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house.\'94\
\
\'93Well--as you please; only don\'92t have a great set out. And, by the bye,\
can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be\
sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect\
anything--\'94\
\
\'93I have not the least wish for it, I thank you.\'94\
\
\'93Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely\
clever.\'94\
\
\'93I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and\
would spurn any body\'92s assistance.\'94\
\
\'93I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on\
donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by. I\
really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life\
I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever\
so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at\
home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and in\
winter there is dirt.\'94\
\
\'93You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is\
never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if\
you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole\'92s. I would wish every thing to\
be as much to your taste as possible.\'94\
\
\'93That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.\
Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the\
warmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--Yes,\
believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in\
the whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please\
me.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He\
wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;\
and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to\
eat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the\
specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at\
Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.\
\
He was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for\
his easy credulity. He did consent. He had not been at Donwell for two\
years. \'93Some very fine morning, he, and Emma, and Harriet, could go\
very well; and he could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls\
walked about the gardens. He did not suppose they could be damp now,\
in the middle of the day. He should like to see the old house again\
exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and\
any other of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to\
his, and Emma\'92s, and Harriet\'92s going there some very fine morning. He\
thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind\
and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not fond of dining\
out.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body\'92s most ready concurrence. The\
invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like\
Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment\
to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of\
pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to\
join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could\
have been dispensed with.--Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that\
he should be glad to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in\
writing, and spare no arguments to induce him to come.\
\
In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to\
Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was\
settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing\
exactly right.\
\
Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was\
safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down, to partake of\
this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the\
Abbey, especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning, he was\
happily placed, quite at his ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what\
had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not\
to heat themselves.--Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on\
purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him, remained, when\
all the others were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and\
sympathiser.\
\
It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she was\
satisfied of her father\'92s comfort, she was glad to leave him, and look\
around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular\
observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must\
ever be so interesting to her and all her family.\
\
She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with\
the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she viewed\
the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming,\
characteristic situation, low and sheltered--its ample gardens\
stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with\
all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its abundance\
of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance\
had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike\
it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many\
comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought\
to be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect\
for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted\
in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had;\
but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She had given them\
neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These were\
pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it\
was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the\
strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank\
Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton,\
in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket,\
was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or\
talking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or\
spoken of.--\'93The best fruit in England--every body\'92s favourite--always\
wholesome.--These the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to\
gather for one\'92s self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning\
decidedly the best time--never tired--every sort good--hautboy\
infinitely superior--no comparison--the others hardly eatable--hautboys\
very scarce--Chili preferred--white wood finest flavour of all--price\
of strawberries in London--abundance about Bristol--Maple\
Grove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly\
different--no general rule--gardeners never to be put out of their\
way--delicious fruit--only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior\
to cherries--currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering\
strawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no\
longer--must go and sit in the shade.\'94\
\
Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by\
Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to\
inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--She had some\
fears of his horse.\
\
Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged\
to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--A\
situation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had\
received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not\
with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and\
splendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs.\
Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.\
Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks,\
every thing--and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with\
immediately.--On her side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she\
positively refused to take her friend\'92s negative, though Miss Fairfax\
continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any\
thing, repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge\
before.--Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an\
acquiescence by the morrow\'92s post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was\
astonishing to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and\
at last, with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a\
removal.--\'93Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the\
gardens--all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent.\'94--The\
pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear.\
\
It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,\
dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one\
another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which\
stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed\
the finish of the pleasure grounds.--It led to nothing; nothing but a\
view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed\
intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to\
the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however, as might be\
the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and\
the view which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at\
nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper\
form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of\
considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--and at\
the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the\
Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and\
handsome curve around it.\
\
It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure,\
English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being\
oppressive.\
\
In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and\
towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet\
distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and\
Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was glad to see it.--There\
had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion, and\
turned from her with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant\
conversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry\
to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now\
she feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of\
prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in\
blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the\
wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He\
was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma\
received a smile which seemed to say, \'93These are my own concerns. I have\
a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of\
introducing Robert Martin.\'94--She did not suspect him. It was too old\
a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--They\
took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade was most\
refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.\
\
The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--and they\
were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs.\
Weston looked, and looked in vain. His father would not own himself\
uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could not be cured of wishing\
that he would part with his black mare. He had expressed himself as to\
coming, with more than common certainty. \'93His aunt was so much better,\
that he had not a doubt of getting over to them.\'94--Mrs. Churchill\'92s\
state, however, as many were ready to remind her, was liable to such\
sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable\
dependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say,\
that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was\
prevented coming.--Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under\
consideration; she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.\
\
The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see\
what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far\
as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at\
any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.--Mr.\
Woodhouse, who had already taken his little round in the highest part\
of the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him,\
stirred no more; and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that\
Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and\
variety which her spirits seemed to need.\
\
Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse\'92s\
entertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals,\
shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets, had been\
prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness\
had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused.\
Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them\
all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than\
in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and\
methodical.--Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma\
walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments\'92 free observation of\
the entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, when\
Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a\
look of escape.--Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there\
was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in\
quest of.\
\
\'93Will you be so kind,\'94 said she, \'93when I am missed, as to say that I am\
gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late it\
is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we shall be wanted,\
and I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to any\
body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to the\
ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not be\
missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am\
gone?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury\
alone?\'94\
\
\'93Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty\
minutes.\'94\
\
\'93But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my\
father\'92s servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. It can be\
round in five minutes.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--And\
for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have to\
guard others!\'94\
\
She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, \'93That\
can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the\
carriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already.\'94\
\
\'93I am,\'94--she answered--\'93I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of\
fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all know\
at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are\
exhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have\
my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.\'94\
\
Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into\
her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and\
watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was\
grateful--and her parting words, \'93Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of\
being sometimes alone!\'94--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and\
to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her,\
even towards some of those who loved her best.\
\
\'93Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!\'94 said Emma, as she turned back into\
the hall again. \'93I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of\
their just horrors, the more I shall like you.\'94\
\
Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only\
accomplished some views of St. Mark\'92s Place, Venice, when Frank\
Churchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had\
forgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him. Mrs. Weston\
would be at ease. The black mare was blameless; _they_ were right\
who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He had been detained by\
a temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had\
lasted some hours--and he had quite given up every thought of coming,\
till very late;--and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and\
how late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have\
come at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing\
like it--almost wished he had staid at home--nothing killed him\
like heat--he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was\
intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the\
slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse\'92s fire, looking very deplorable.\
\
\'93You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,\'94 said Emma.\
\
\'93As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be\
spared--but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be\
going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met _one_ as I\
came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!\'94\
\
Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill\'92s\
state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of\
humour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be\
his constitution; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often\
the cure of such incidental complaints, she recommended his taking\
some refreshment; he would find abundance of every thing in the\
dining-room--and she humanely pointed out the door.\
\
\'93No--he should not eat. He was not hungry; it would only make him\
hotter.\'94 In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and\
muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all her\
attention to her father, saying in secret--\
\
\'93I am glad I have done being in love with him. I should not like a man\
who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet\'92s sweet easy temper\
will not mind it.\'94\
\
He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came\
back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners, like\
himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their\
employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late.\
He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and,\
at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking\
over views in Swisserland.\
\
\'93As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,\'94 said he. \'93I shall\
never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my\
sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or my\
poem. I shall do something to expose myself.\'94\
\
\'93That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to\
Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England.\'94\
\
\'93They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for\
her. I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I\
assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I\
shall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I\
want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating\
eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--and would leave it to-morrow, if\
I could.\'94\
\
\'93You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few\
hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?\'94\
\
\'93_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do\
not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted\
in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate\
person.\'94\
\
\'93You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and\
eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of\
cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on\
a par with the rest of us.\'94\
\
\'93No--I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure.\'94\
\
\'93We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us. It is not\
Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of\
a change. You will stay, and go with us?\'94\
\
\'93No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.\'94\
\
\'93But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.\'94\
\
\'93No--It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross.\'94\
\
\'93Then pray stay at Richmond.\'94\
\
\'93But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you\
all there without me.\'94\
\
\'93These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your\
own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.\'94\
\
The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.\
With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others\
took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and\
disturbance on Miss Fairfax\'92s disappearance being explained. That it was\
time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final\
arrangement for the next day\'92s scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill\'92s\
little inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his last\
words to Emma were,\
\
\'93Well;--if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party, I will.\'94\
\
She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond\
was to take him back before the following evening.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VII\
\
\
They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward\
circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in\
favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating\
safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good\
time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her niece, with\
the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr.\
Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there.\
Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body\
had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount\
of the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits,\
a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much\
into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of\
Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.\
And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed\
at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and\
Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable\
as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the\
hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties,\
too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any\
cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.\
\
At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She had never seen Frank\
Churchill so silent and stupid. He said nothing worth hearing--looked\
without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowing\
what she said. While he was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet\
should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.\
\
When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,\
for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.\
Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.\
To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he cared\
for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay\
and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement, the admission\
to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first and most animating\
period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her own estimation,\
meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must\
have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very\
well describe. \'93Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together\
excessively.\'94 They were laying themselves open to that very phrase--and\
to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to\
Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any\
real felicity; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had\
expected. She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked\
him for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,\
admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning\
back her heart. She still intended him for her friend.\
\
\'93How much I am obliged to you,\'94 said he, \'93for telling me to come\
to-day!--If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all\
the happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you\
were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you\
deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come.\'94\
\
\'93Don\'92t say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me.\'94\
\
\'93It is hotter to-day.\'94\
\
\'93Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day.\'94\
\
\'93You are comfortable because you are under command.\'94\
\
\'93Your command?--Yes.\'94\
\
\'93Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,\
somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own\
management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot be always\
with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command\
rather than mine.\'94\
\
\'93It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a\
motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always\
with me. You are always with me.\'94\
\
\'93Dating from three o\'92clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not\
begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before.\'94\
\
\'93Three o\'92clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you\
first in February.\'94\
\
\'93Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her voice)--nobody\
speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking\
nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people.\'94\
\
\'93I say nothing of which I am ashamed,\'94 replied he, with lively\
impudence. \'93I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill\
hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side,\
and Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February.\'94 And then\
whispering--\'93Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do\
to rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They _shall_ talk. Ladies\
and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is,\
presides) to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking\
of?\'94\
\
Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great\
deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse\'92s presiding; Mr.\
Knightley\'92s answer was the most distinct.\
\
\'93Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all\
thinking of?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no, no\'94--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--\'93Upon no\
account in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt\
of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking\
of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing\
at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of\
knowing.\'94\
\
\'93It is a sort of thing,\'94 cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, \'93which _I_\
should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though,\
perhaps, as the _Chaperon_ of the party--_I_ never was in any\
circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married women--\'94\
\
Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured, in reply,\
\
\'93Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard\
of--but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every\
body knows what is due to _you_.\'94\
\
\'93It will not do,\'94 whispered Frank to Emma; \'93they are most of them\
affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen--I\
am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she waives her right of\
knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires\
something very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here\
are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she is pleased to say, am very\
entertaining already,) and she only demands from each of you either one\
thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated--or two\
things moderately clever--or three things very dull indeed, and she\
engages to laugh heartily at them all.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! very well,\'94 exclaimed Miss Bates, \'93then I need not be uneasy.\
\'91Three things very dull indeed.\'92 That will just do for me, you know. I\
shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth,\
shan\'92t I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every\
body\'92s assent)--Do not you all think I shall?\'94\
\
Emma could not resist.\
\
\'93Ah! ma\'92am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me--but you will be\
limited as to number--only three at once.\'94\
\
Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not\
immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could not\
anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.\
\
\'93Ah!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see what she means, (turning to Mr.\
Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very\
disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend.\'94\
\
\'93I like your plan,\'94 cried Mr. Weston. \'93Agreed, agreed. I will do my\
best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?\'94\
\
\'93Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,\'94 answered his son;--\'93but we shall be\
indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.\'94\
\
\'93No, no,\'94 said Emma, \'93it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr.\
Weston\'92s shall clear him and his next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me\
hear it.\'94\
\
\'93I doubt its being very clever myself,\'94 said Mr. Weston. \'93It is too much\
a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet are\
there, that express perfection?\'94\
\
\'93What two letters!--express perfection! I am sure I do not know.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never\
guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?\'94\
\
Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a very\
indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and\
enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem to touch\
the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr.\
Knightley gravely said,\
\
\'93This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston\
has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every body\
else. _Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,\'94 said Mrs. Elton; \'93_I_\
really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had\
an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all\
pleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!--You know\
who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things are very\
well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of\
place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer.\
Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have witty\
things at every body\'92s service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a\
great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to\
judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please,\
Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing\
clever to say--not one of us.\
\
\'93Yes, yes, pray pass _me_,\'94 added her husband, with a sort of sneering\
consciousness; \'93_I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss\
Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man--quite good for\
nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?\'94\
\
\'93With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.\
Come, Jane, take my other arm.\'94\
\
Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.\
\'93Happy couple!\'94 said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of\
hearing:--\'93How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as they\
did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew\
each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky!--for as to\
any real knowledge of a person\'92s disposition that Bath, or any public\
place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is\
only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as\
they always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it\
is all guess and luck--and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man\
has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest\
of his life!\'94\
\
Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her own\
confederates, spoke now.\
\
\'93Such things do occur, undoubtedly.\'94--She was stopped by a cough. Frank\
Churchill turned towards her to listen.\
\
\'93You were speaking,\'94 said he, gravely. She recovered her voice.\
\
\'93I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances\
do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be\
very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--but there is\
generally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood to\
mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness\
must be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate\
acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.\'94\
\
He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon\
afterwards said, in a lively tone,\
\
\'93Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I\
marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning to\
Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body\
fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile at\
his father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her, educate\
her.\'94\
\
\'93And make her like myself.\'94\
\
\'93By all means, if you can.\'94\
\
\'93Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.\'94\
\
\'93She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.\
I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return, I shall come\
to you for my wife. Remember.\'94\
\
Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every\
favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?\
Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.\
He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment; who could say?\
Referring the education to her seemed to imply it.\
\
\'93Now, ma\'92am,\'94 said Jane to her aunt, \'93shall we join Mrs. Elton?\'94\
\
\'93If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was\
ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well. We shall\
soon overtake her. There she is--no, that\'92s somebody else. That\'92s one\
of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--Well, I\
declare--\'94\
\
They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston,\
his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man\'92s spirits\
now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last of\
flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about\
with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended\
to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her. The\
appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the\
carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and\
preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have _her_\
carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive\
home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of\
pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,\
she hoped never to be betrayed into again.\
\
While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side. He\
looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,\
\
\'93Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a\
privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it.\
I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be\
so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to\
a woman of her character, age, and situation?--Emma, I had not thought\
it possible.\'94\
\
Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.\
\
\'93Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.\
It was not so very bad. I dare say she did not understand me.\'94\
\
\'93I assure you she did. She felt your full meaning. She has talked of\
it since. I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--with what\
candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her honouring your\
forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions, as she was for\
ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her society must be\
so irksome.\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94 cried Emma, \'93I know there is not a better creature in the world:\
but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most\
unfortunately blended in her.\'94\
\
\'93They are blended,\'94 said he, \'93I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,\
I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over\
the good. Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless\
absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any\
liberties of manner. Were she your equal in situation--but, Emma,\
consider how far this is from being the case. She is poor; she has sunk\
from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live to old age, must\
probably sink more. Her situation should secure your compassion. It was\
badly done, indeed! You, whom she had known from an infant, whom she had\
seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour, to have you\
now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her,\
humble her--and before her niece, too--and before others, many of whom\
(certainly _some_,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment\
of her.--This is not pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from\
pleasant to me; but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;\
satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and\
trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you\
can do now.\'94\
\
While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was\
ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in. He had\
misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted, and her\
tongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself,\
mortification, and deep concern. She had not been able to speak; and, on\
entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome--then reproaching\
herself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in\
apparent sullenness, she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a\
difference; but it was just too late. He had turned away, and the horses\
were in motion. She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with\
what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and\
every thing left far behind. She was vexed beyond what could have been\
expressed--almost beyond what she could conceal. Never had she felt so\
agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her life. She was\
most forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no\
denying. She felt it at her heart. How could she have been so brutal,\
so cruel to Miss Bates! How could she have exposed herself to such ill\
opinion in any one she valued! And how suffer him to leave her without\
saying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!\
\
Time did not compose her. As she reflected more, she seemed but to feel\
it more. She never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary\
to speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself,\
fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running\
down her cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble to\
check them, extraordinary as they were.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER VIII\
\
\
The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma\'92s thoughts all the\
evening. How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she could\
not tell. They, in their different homes, and their different ways,\
might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it was\
a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational\
satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than\
any she had ever passed. A whole evening of back-gammon with her father,\
was felicity to it. _There_, indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she\
was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his comfort; and\
feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and\
confiding esteem, she could not, in her general conduct, be open to any\
severe reproach. As a daughter, she hoped she was not without a heart.\
She hoped no one could have said to her, \'93How could you be so unfeeling\
to your father?--I must, I will tell you truths while I can.\'94 Miss\
Bates should never again--no, never! If attention, in future, could do\
away the past, she might hope to be forgiven. She had been often remiss,\
her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact;\
scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more. In the warmth of true\
contrition, she would call upon her the very next morning, and it should\
be the beginning, on her side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.\
\
She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that\
nothing might prevent her. It was not unlikely, she thought, that she\
might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might come in\
while she were paying her visit. She had no objection. She would not be\
ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers.\
Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but she saw him not.\
\
\'93The ladies were all at home.\'94 She had never rejoiced at the sound\
before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,\
with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of\
deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.\
\
There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.\
She heard Miss Bates\'92s voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the\
maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased to wait a\
moment, and then ushered her in too soon. The aunt and niece seemed both\
escaping into the adjoining room. Jane she had a distinct glimpse of,\
looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she heard\
Miss Bates saying, \'93Well, my dear, I shall _say_ you are laid down upon\
the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.\'94\
\
Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she did not\
quite understand what was going on.\
\
\'93I am afraid Jane is not very well,\'94 said she, \'93but I do not know; they\
_tell_ me she is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently,\
Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair. I wish Hetty had not gone. I am\
very little able--Have you a chair, ma\'92am? Do you sit where you like? I\
am sure she will be here presently.\'94\
\
Emma seriously hoped she would. She had a moment\'92s fear of Miss Bates\
keeping away from her. But Miss Bates soon came--\'93Very happy and\
obliged\'94--but Emma\'92s conscience told her that there was not the same\
cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner. A very\
friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead the way to a\
return of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.\
\
\'93Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--and\
are come to give us joy. This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in\
me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be very trying for us\
to part with her, after having had her so long, and she has a dreadful\
headache just now, writing all the morning:--such long letters, you\
know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon. \'91My dear,\'92 said\
I, \'91you will blind yourself\'92--for tears were in her eyes perpetually.\
One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. It is a great change; and though\
she is amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no\
young woman before ever met with on first going out--do not think us\
ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again\
dispersing her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a\
headache she has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel\
any blessing quite as it may deserve. She is as low as possible. To\
look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have\
secured such a situation. You will excuse her not coming to you--she is\
not able--she is gone into her own room--I want her to lie down upon the\
bed. \'91My dear,\'92 said I, \'91I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:\'92\
but, however, she is not; she is walking about the room. But, now that\
she has written her letters, she says she shall soon be well. She will\
be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your\
kindness will excuse her. You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite\
ashamed--but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that\
we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not\
know any body was coming. \'91It is only Mrs. Cole,\'92 said I, \'91depend upon\
it. Nobody else would come so early.\'92 \'91Well,\'92 said she, \'91it must be\
borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.\'92 But then Patty\
came in, and said it was you. \'91Oh!\'92 said I, \'91it is Miss Woodhouse: I am\
sure you will like to see her.\'92--\'91I can see nobody,\'92 said she; and\
up she got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you\
waiting--and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. \'91If you must go, my\
dear,\'92 said I, \'91you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the\
bed.\'92\'94\
\
Emma was most sincerely interested. Her heart had been long growing\
kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted\
as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing but\
pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of\
the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on\
seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she might not bear\
to see herself. She spoke as she felt, with earnest regret and\
solicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she collected\
from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for\
Miss Fairfax\'92s advantage and comfort as possible. \'93It must be a severe\
trial to them all. She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel\
Campbell\'92s return.\'94\
\
\'93So very kind!\'94 replied Miss Bates. \'93But you are always kind.\'94\
\
There was no bearing such an \'93always;\'94 and to break through her dreadful\
gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--\
\
\'93Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?\'94\
\
\'93To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have the charge\
of her three little girls--delightful children. Impossible that any\
situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps,\
Mrs. Suckling\'92s own family, and Mrs. Bragge\'92s; but Mrs. Smallridge is\
intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four\
miles from Maple Grove. Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove.\'94\
\
\'93Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--\'94\
\
\'93Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She\
would not take a denial. She would not let Jane say, \'91No;\'92 for when Jane\
first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday, the very morning\
we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it, she was quite decided\
against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly\
as you say, she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel\
Campbell\'92s return, and nothing should induce her to enter into any\
engagement at present--and so she told Mrs. Elton over and over\
again--and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her\
mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her, saw\
farther than I did. It is not every body that would have stood out in\
such a kind way as she did, and refuse to take Jane\'92s answer; but she\
positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday, as\
Jane wished her; she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it\
was all settled that Jane should go. Quite a surprize to me! I had not\
the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once, that\
upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge\'92s situation, she\
had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it\
till it was all settled.\'94\
\
\'93You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?\'94\
\
\'93Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon\
the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. \'91You _must_\
_all_ spend your evening with us,\'92 said she--\'91I positively must have you\
_all_ come.\'92\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?\'94\
\
\'93No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I\
thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let him\
off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and\
a very agreeable evening we had. Such kind friends, you know, Miss\
Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed\
rather fagged after the morning\'92s party. Even pleasure, you know, is\
fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have\
enjoyed it. However, _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party,\
and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.\'94\
\
\'93Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been\
making up her mind the whole day?\'94\
\
\'93I dare say she had.\'94\
\
\'93Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all her\
friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation that is\
possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing\
in the world that can make her happy in it. Except the Sucklings and\
Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal\
and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton\'92s acquaintance. Mrs. Smallridge, a most\
delightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove--and as\
to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there\
are not such elegant sweet children anywhere. Jane will be treated with\
such regard and kindness!--It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of\
pleasure.--And her salary!--I really cannot venture to name her salary\
to you, Miss Woodhouse. Even you, used as you are to great sums, would\
hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! madam,\'94 cried Emma, \'93if other children are at all like what I\
remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of\
what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly\
earned.\'94\
\
\'93You are so noble in your ideas!\'94\
\
\'93And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?\'94\
\
\'93Very soon, very soon, indeed; that\'92s the worst of it. Within a\
fortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not\
know how to bear it. So then, I try to put it out of her thoughts, and\
say, Come ma\'92am, do not let us think about it any more.\'94\
\
\'93Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel and\
Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their\
return?\'94\
\
\'93Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation\
as she cannot feel herself justified in declining. I was so astonished\
when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when\
Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it! It was\
before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea, because we were\
just going to cards--and yet it was before tea, because I remember\
thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it; something happened\
before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before\
tea, old John Abdy\'92s son wanted to speak with him. Poor old John, I\
have a great regard for him; he was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven\
years; and now, poor old man, he is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the\
rheumatic gout in his joints--I must go and see him to-day; and so will\
Jane, I am sure, if she gets out at all. And poor John\'92s son came to\
talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he is very well to do\
himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing\
of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;\
and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler had been\
telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to\
Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond. That was what happened\
before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton.\'94\
\
Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this\
circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it possible that she\
could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill\'92s\
going, she proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.\
\
What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the\
accumulation of the ostler\'92s own knowledge, and the knowledge of the\
servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond\
soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger,\
however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had\
sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable\
account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming\
back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having\
resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse\
seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the\
Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy\
going a good pace, and driving very steady.\
\
There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it\
caught Emma\'92s attention only as it united with the subject which already\
engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill\'92s importance in\
the world, and Jane Fairfax\'92s, struck her; one was every thing, the\
other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference of woman\'92s destiny,\
and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss\
Bates\'92s saying,\
\
\'93Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte. What is to become\
of that?--Very true. Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--\'91You\
must go,\'92 said she. \'91You and I must part. You will have no business\
here.--Let it stay, however,\'92 said she; \'91give it houseroom till Colonel\
Campbell comes back. I shall talk about it to him; he will settle for\
me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.\'92--And to this day, I do\
believe, she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter\'92s.\'94\
\
Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of\
all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,\
that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough;\
and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of\
the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER IX\
\
\
Emma\'92s pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;\
but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr.\
Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting\
with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner\
decidedly graver than usual, said,\
\
\'93I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,\
and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend\
a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say,\
besides the \'91love,\'92 which nobody carries?\'94\
\
\'93Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?\'94\
\
\'93Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time.\'94\
\
Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time,\
however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends\
again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her father\
began his inquiries.\
\
\'93Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you find my\
worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must have been very\
much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs.\
and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She is always so\
attentive to them!\'94\
\
Emma\'92s colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a\
smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr.\
Knightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in\
her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that\
had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--\
He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified--and in\
another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common\
friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--whether she had not\
herself made the first motion, she could not say--she might, perhaps,\
have rather offered it--but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly\
was on the point of carrying it to his lips--when, from some fancy or\
other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should feel such a scruple, why\
he should change his mind when it was all but done, she could not\
perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought, if he had not\
stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was\
that his manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it\
happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--It was with him,\
of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--She could not but recall the\
attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity.--He left\
them immediately afterwards--gone in a moment. He always moved with the\
alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but\
now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.\
\
Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she\
had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure\
to talk over Jane Fairfax\'92s situation with Mr. Knightley.--Neither\
would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she\
knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have happened\
at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it, would have been\
pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however; she could not\
be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished\
gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered\
his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them half an hour, she\
found. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!\
\
In the hope of diverting her father\'92s thoughts from the disagreeableness\
of Mr. Knightley\'92s going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on\
horseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her\
news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified;\
it supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him. He\
had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax\'92s going out as governess, and\
could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley\'92s going to London had\
been an unexpected blow.\
\
\'93I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so comfortably\
settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say\
her acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry\
situation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to\
be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor\'92s always was with me.\
You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor\
was to us. And I hope she will be better off in one respect, and not be\
induced to go away after it has been her home so long.\'94\
\
The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else\
into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the\
death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her nephew had had no particular reason\
to hasten back on her account, she had not lived above six-and-thirty\
hours after his return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any\
thing foreboded by her general state, had carried her off after a short\
struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.\
\
It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of\
gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the\
surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where\
she would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops\
to folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be\
disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.\
Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was\
now spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully\
justified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The\
event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of\
imaginary complaints.\
\
\'93Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:\
more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try the\
temper. It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults, what\
would Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill\'92s loss would be\
dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it.\'94--Even Mr.\
Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, \'93Ah! poor woman,\
who would have thought it!\'94 and resolved, that his mourning should be as\
handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her\
broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it\
would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also\
a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill,\
the grief of her husband--her mind glanced over them both with awe and\
compassion--and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might\
be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a moment\
all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have\
nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared\
by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his\
nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form\
the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel\
no certainty of its being already formed.\
\
Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.\
What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma\
was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,\
and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.\
They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill\'92s death with mutual\
forbearance.\
\
Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all\
that was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill\
was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the\
departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very\
old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a\
visit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for\
Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible\
on Emma\'92s side.\
\
It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose\
prospects were closing, while Harriet\'92s opened, and whose engagements\
now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her\
kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely\
a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she\
had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she\
would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted\
to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and testify\
respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day\
at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused,\
and by a verbal message. \'93Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;\'94\
 and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared\
that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against\
her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under severe\
headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt the\
possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge\'92s at the time proposed.\
Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--appetite quite\
gone--and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing\
touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension\
of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she had\
undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself,\
though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her\
present home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous\
disorder:--confined always to one room;--he could have wished it\
otherwise--and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must\
acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that\
description. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were,\
in fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived\
more evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern;\
grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some\
way of being useful. To take her--be it only an hour or two--from\
her aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational\
conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the\
following morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language\
she could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any\
hour that Jane would name--mentioning that she had Mr. Perry\'92s decided\
opinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was only\
in this short note:\
\
\'93Miss Fairfax\'92s compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any\
exercise.\'94\
\
Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was\
impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed\
indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best\
counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the\
answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates\'92s,\
in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--but it would not\
do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing\
with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest\
service--and every thing that message could do was tried--but all in\
vain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was\
quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her\
worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers;\
but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear\
that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.\
\'93Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any\
body--any body at all--Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and\
Mrs. Cole had made such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but,\
except them, Jane would really see nobody.\'94\
\
Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,\
and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could\
she feel any right of preference herself--she submitted, therefore, and\
only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece\'92s appetite and diet,\
which she longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates\
was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any\
thing:--Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing\
they could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was\
distasteful.\
\
Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an\
examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality\
was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In half\
an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from Miss\
Bates, but \'93dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent\
back; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover, she insisted on\
her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing.\'94\
\
When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering\
about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of\
the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal to any\
exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage,\
she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--that Jane was\
resolved to receive no kindness from _her_. She was sorry, very sorry.\
Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable\
from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and\
inequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little\
credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but\
she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of\
being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy\
to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen\
into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to\
reprove.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER X\
\
\
One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill\'92s decease, Emma was\
called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who \'93could not stay five minutes,\
and wanted particularly to speak with her.\'94--He met her at the\
parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of\
his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,\
\
\'93Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be\
possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you.\'94\
\
\'93Is she unwell?\'94\
\
\'93No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered the\
carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you\
know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?\'94\
\
\'93Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what\
you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?--Is she really not\
ill?\'94\
\
\'93Depend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all in\
time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!\'94\
\
To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something\
really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was\
well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father,\
that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out of\
the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.\
\
\'93Now,\'94--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--\'93now\
Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.\'94\
\
\'93No, no,\'94--he gravely replied.--\'93Don\'92t ask me. I promised my wife to\
leave it all to her. She will break it to you better than I can. Do not\
be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon.\'94\
\
\'93Break it to me,\'94 cried Emma, standing still with terror.--\'93Good\
God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened in Brunswick\
Square. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it\
is.\'94\
\
\'93No, indeed you are mistaken.\'94--\
\
\'93Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest\
friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it?--I charge you\
by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.\'94\
\
\'93Upon my word, Emma.\'94--\
\
\'93Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that\
it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens!--What can be to be\
_broke_ to me, that does not relate to one of that family?\'94\
\
\'93Upon my honour,\'94 said he very seriously, \'93it does not. It is not in\
the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of\
Knightley.\'94\
\
Emma\'92s courage returned, and she walked on.\
\
\'93I was wrong,\'94 he continued, \'93in talking of its being _broke_ to you.\
I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern\
you--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my\
dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don\'92t\
say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might be much\
worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.\'94\
\
Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She\
asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and\
that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money\
concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the\
circumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond\
had brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural\
children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--This, though very\
undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little more\
than an animating curiosity.\
\
\'93Who is that gentleman on horseback?\'94 said she, as they\
proceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret,\
than with any other view.\
\
\'93I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, I\
assure you. You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this\
time.\'94\
\
\'93Has your son been with you, then?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.\'94\
\
For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded\
and demure,\
\
\'93Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.\'94\
\
They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--\'93Well, my dear,\'94 said\
he, as they entered the room--\'93I have brought her, and now I hope you\
will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in\
delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.\'94--And Emma distinctly\
heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--\'93I have\
been as good as my word. She has not the least idea.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,\
that Emma\'92s uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she\
eagerly said,\
\
\'93What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I\
find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is. I have been\
walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense.\
Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your\
distress, whatever it may be.\'94\
\
\'93Have you indeed no idea?\'94 said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.\
\'93Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are to\
hear?\'94\
\
\'93So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess.\'94\
\
\'93You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;\'94\
 (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) \'93He has\
been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is\
impossible to express our surprize. He came to speak to his father on a\
subject,--to announce an attachment--\'94\
\
She stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of\
Harriet.\
\
\'93More than an attachment, indeed,\'94 resumed Mrs. Weston; \'93an\
engagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will\
any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are\
engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!\'94\
\
Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,\
\
\'93Jane Fairfax!--Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?\'94\
\
\'93You may well be amazed,\'94 returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,\
and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--\
\'93You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn\
engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth, and\
kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but\
themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--It is so\
wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost\
incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it.--I thought I knew him.\'94\
\
Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between two\
ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and\
poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and require\
confirmation, repeated confirmation.\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said she at last, trying to recover herself; \'93this is a\
circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at\
all comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter--before either\
of them came to Highbury?\'94\
\
\'93Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very\
much. It has hurt his father equally. _Some_ _part_ of his conduct we\
cannot excuse.\'94\
\
Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, \'93I will not pretend _not_ to\
understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured\
that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are\
apprehensive of.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma\'92s countenance was as\
steady as her words.\
\
\'93That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my\
present perfect indifference,\'94 she continued, \'93I will farther tell you,\
that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I\
did like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay,\
was attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.\
Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past,\
for at least these three months, cared nothing about him. You may\
believe me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find\
utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good\
than any thing else in the world could do.\
\
\'93Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,\'94 said she. \'93On\
this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you\
might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--\
Imagine what we have been feeling on your account.\'94\
\
\'93I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful\
wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston;\
and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame. What right had he\
to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners\
so _very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as\
he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering\
attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged to\
another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--How could\
he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--very wrong,\
very wrong indeed.\'94\
\
\'93From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--\'94\
\
\'93And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!\
to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,\
before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,\
which I can neither comprehend nor respect.\'94\
\
\'93There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said so expressly.\
He had not time to enter into much explanation. He was here only a\
quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow\
the full use even of the time he could stay--but that there had been\
misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed,\
seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very\
possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct.\'94\
\
\'93Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure. Much, much\
beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him\
in my opinion. So unlike what a man should be!--None of that upright\
integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of\
trick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of\
his life.\'94\
\
\'93Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong\
in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having\
many, very many, good qualities; and--\'94\
\
\'93Good God!\'94 cried Emma, not attending to her.--\'93Mrs. Smallridge, too!\
Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he mean by\
such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her to engage herself--to suffer her\
even to think of such a measure!\'94\
\
\'93He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit\
him. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him--or at\
least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--Till yesterday, I\
know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I do\
not know how, but by some letter or message--and it was the discovery of\
what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him\
to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on\
his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of\
concealment that had been carrying on so long.\'94\
\
Emma began to listen better.\
\
\'93I am to hear from him soon,\'94 continued Mrs. Weston. \'93He told me at\
parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which\
seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let\
us wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It\
may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to\
be understood. Don\'92t let us be severe, don\'92t let us be in a hurry to\
condemn him. Let us have patience. I must love him; and now that I am\
satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious\
for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must\
both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and\
concealment.\'94\
\
\'93_His_ sufferings,\'94 replied Emma dryly, \'93do not appear to have done him\
much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?\'94\
\
\'93Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely a\
difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family!\
While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a\
hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in\
the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite\
to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue\
influence does not survive the grave!--He gave his consent with very\
little persuasion.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 thought Emma, \'93he would have done as much for Harriet.\'94\
\
\'93This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this\
morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates\'92s, I fancy, some time--and\
then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle,\
to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you,\
he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--He was very much\
agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appear quite\
a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In\
addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so\
very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--and there was\
every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal.\'94\
\
\'93And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such\
perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of\
the engagement?\'94\
\
Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.\
\
\'93None; not one. He positively said that it had been known to no being in\
the world but their two selves.\'94\
\
\'93Well,\'94 said Emma, \'93I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the\
idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a\
very abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of\
hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--To come among us with\
professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret\
to judge us all!--Here have we been, the whole winter and spring,\
completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth\
and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been\
carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and\
words that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the\
consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not\
perfectly agreeable!\'94\
\
\'93I am quite easy on that head,\'94 replied Mrs. Weston. \'93I am very sure\
that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not\
have heard.\'94\
\
\'93You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you\
imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.\'94\
\
\'93True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss\
Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her; and\
as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe.\'94\
\
At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,\
evidently on the watch. His wife gave him a look which invited him\
in; and, while he was coming round, added, \'93Now, dearest Emma, let me\
intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease,\
and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of\
it--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It\
is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that,\
why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for\
Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such\
steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her\
credit for--and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of\
this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may\
be said in her situation for even that error!\'94\
\
\'93Much, indeed!\'94 cried Emma feelingly. \'93If a woman can ever be\
excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane\
Fairfax\'92s.--Of such, one may almost say, that \'91the world is not their\'92s,\
nor the world\'92s law.\'92\'94\
\
She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,\
exclaiming,\
\
\'93A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a\
device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of\
guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half\
your property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of\
condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate\
you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the\
most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.\'94\
\
A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as\
right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was\
immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shook\
her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in\
a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think\
the engagement no very bad thing. His companions suggested only what\
could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they\
had talked it all over together, and he had talked it all over again\
with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly\
reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank\
could possibly have done.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XI\
\
\
\'93Harriet, poor Harriet!\'94--Those were the words; in them lay the\
tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted\
the real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved very\
ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _his_\
behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him. It was the\
scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet\'92s account, that gave the\
deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second time the\
dupe of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken\
prophetically, when he once said, \'93Emma, you have been no friend\
to Harriet Smith.\'94--She was afraid she had done her nothing but\
disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this\
instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of\
the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise\
never have entered Harriet\'92s imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged\
her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever\
given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty\
of having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have\
prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence\
would have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought\
to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend\'92s\
happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed\
her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him,\
and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring\
for her.--\'93But, with common sense,\'94 she added, \'93I am afraid I have had\
little to do.\'94\
\
She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry\
with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--As for Jane\
Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present\
solicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need\
no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health\
having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her\
days of insignificance and evil were over.--She would soon be well, and\
happy, and prosperous.--Emma could now imagine why her own attentions\
had been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No\
doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane\'92s eyes she had been a rival;\
and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be\
repulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,\
and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She\
understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from\
the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that\
Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her\
desert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little\
sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful\
that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.\
Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and\
judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet\'92s mind, producing\
reserve and self-command, it would.--She must communicate the painful\
truth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had\
been among Mr. Weston\'92s parting words. \'93For the present, the whole\
affair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of\
it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;\
and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.\'94--Emma had\
promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.\
\
In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost\
ridiculous, that she should have the very same distressing and delicate\
office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by\
herself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,\
she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat quick\
on hearing Harriet\'92s footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs.\
Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls. Could the event of\
the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--But of that, unfortunately,\
there could be no chance.\
\
\'93Well, Miss Woodhouse!\'94 cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--\'93is\
not this the oddest news that ever was?\'94\
\
\'93What news do you mean?\'94 replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or\
voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.\
\
\'93About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!--you\
need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me\
himself. I met him just now. He told me it was to be a great secret;\
and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you,\
but he said you knew it.\'94\
\
\'93What did Mr. Weston tell you?\'94--said Emma, still perplexed.\
\
\'93Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill\
are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one\
another this long while. How very odd!\'94\
\
It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet\'92s behaviour was so extremely odd,\
that Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared\
absolutely changed. She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or\
disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at\
her, quite unable to speak.\
\
\'93Had you any idea,\'94 cried Harriet, \'93of his being in love with her?--You,\
perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke) who can see into every\
body\'92s heart; but nobody else--\'94\
\
\'93Upon my word,\'94 said Emma, \'93I begin to doubt my having any such talent.\
Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached\
to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not\
openly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never\
had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank\
Churchill\'92s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very\
sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly.\'94\
\
\'93Me!\'94 cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. \'93Why should you caution\
me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.\'94\
\
\'93I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,\'94 replied\
Emma, smiling; \'93but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and\
not very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you\
did care about him?\'94\
\
\'93Him!--never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?\'94\
 turning away distressed.\
\
\'93Harriet!\'94 cried Emma, after a moment\'92s pause--\'93What do you mean?--Good\
Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--\'94\
\
She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she sat down,\
waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.\
\
Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from\
her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak, it was\
in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma\'92s.\
\
\'93I should not have thought it possible,\'94 she began, \'93that you could have\
misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him--but considering\
how infinitely superior he is to every body else, I should not have\
thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.\
Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him in\
the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of\
Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his side. And that you should\
have been so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that\
you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I\
should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,\
to dare to think of him. At first, if you had not told me that more\
wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater\
disparity (those were your very words);--I should not have dared to\
give way to--I should not have thought it possible--But if _you_, who\
had been always acquainted with him--\'94\
\
\'93Harriet!\'94 cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--\'93Let us understand\
each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you\
speaking of--Mr. Knightley?\'94\
\
\'93To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else--and so\
I thought you knew. When we talked about him, it was as clear as\
possible.\'94\
\
\'93Not quite,\'94 returned Emma, with forced calmness, \'93for all that you then\
said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almost\
assert that you had _named_ Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the service\
Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the\
gipsies, was spoken of.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!\'94\
\
\'93My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on\
the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment;\
that considering the service he had rendered you, it was extremely\
natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to\
your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had\
been in seeing him come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is\
strong on my memory.\'94\
\
\'93Oh, dear,\'94 cried Harriet, \'93now I recollect what you mean; but I\
was thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the\
gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some\
elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr.\
Knightley\'92s coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not\
stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That\
was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that\
was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every\
other being upon earth.\'94\
\
\'93Good God!\'94 cried Emma, \'93this has been a most unfortunate--most\
deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?\'94\
\
\'93You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At\
least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the\
other had been the person; and now--it _is_ possible--\'94\
\
She paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.\
\
\'93I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,\'94 she resumed, \'93that you should feel a\
great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must\
think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But\
I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it may\
appear--. But you know they were your own words, that _more_ wonderful\
things had happened, matches of _greater_ disparity had taken place than\
between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such\
a thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should be so\
fortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should really--if\
_he_ does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will\
not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But\
you are too good for that, I am sure.\'94\
\
Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look at\
her in consternation, and hastily said,\
\
\'93Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley\'92s returning your affection?\'94\
\
\'93Yes,\'94 replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--\'93I must say that I\
have.\'94\
\
Emma\'92s eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,\
in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient\
for making her acquainted with her own heart. A mind like hers,\
once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She touched--she\
admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse\
that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank\
Churchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet\'92s having\
some hope of a return? It darted through her, with the speed of an\
arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!\
\
Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the same\
few minutes. She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed\
her before. How improperly had she been acting by Harriet! How\
inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been\
her conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her on! It struck her\
with dreadful force, and she was ready to give it every bad name in the\
world. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all\
these demerits--some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense\
of justice by Harriet--(there would be no need of _compassion_ to the\
girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required\
that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the\
resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent\
kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost\
extent of Harriet\'92s hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done\
nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily\
formed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose\
counsels had never led her right.--Rousing from reflection, therefore,\
and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more\
inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which\
had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was\
quite sunk and lost.--Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and\
themselves.\
\
Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad\
to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and\
such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give\
the history of her hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma\'92s\
tremblings as she asked, and as she listened, were better concealed than\
Harriet\'92s, but they were not less. Her voice was not unsteady; but her\
mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such\
a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing\
emotions, must create.--She listened with much inward suffering, but\
with great outward patience, to Harriet\'92s detail.--Methodical, or well\
arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it\
contained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of\
the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--especially with the\
corroborating circumstances, which her own memory brought in favour of\
Mr. Knightley\'92s most improved opinion of Harriet.\
\
Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since\
those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,\
found her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at\
least from the time of Miss Woodhouse\'92s encouraging her to think of him,\
Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he\
had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different manner\
towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she had been\
more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together,\
he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very\
delightfully!--He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it\
to have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to\
almost the same extent.--Harriet repeated expressions of approbation\
and praise from him--and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement\
with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for\
being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous,\
feelings.--She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he\
had dwelt on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet\'92s\
memory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from\
him, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment\
implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,\
by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour\'92s relation,\
and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed\
undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to\
be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without\
some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his walking\
with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they\
had been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as\
she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself--and at first,\
he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done\
before, in a very particular way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall\
it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her, whether her\
affections were engaged.--But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared\
likely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about\
farming:--The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half\
an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of\
his being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said that\
he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her, during their\
conversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much against\
his inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as\
Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to _her_. The superior degree of\
confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her\
severe pain.\
\
On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did, after a\
little reflection, venture the following question. \'93Might he not?--Is\
not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of\
your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--he might have\
Mr. Martin\'92s interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with\
spirit.\
\
\'93Mr. Martin! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I\
know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.\'94\
\
When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss\
Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.\
\
\'93I never should have presumed to think of it at first,\'94 said she, \'93but\
for you. You told me to observe him carefully, and let his behaviour\
be the rule of mine--and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may\
deserve him; and that if he does chuse me, it will not be any thing so\
very wonderful.\'94\
\
The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings,\
made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma\'92s side, to enable her to say\
on reply,\
\
\'93Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last\
man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his\
feeling for her more than he really does.\'94\
\
Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so\
satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which\
at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her\
father\'92s footsteps. He was coming through the hall. Harriet was too\
much agitated to encounter him. \'93She could not compose herself--\
Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;\'94--with most ready\
encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through another\
door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of\
Emma\'92s feelings: \'93Oh God! that I had never seen her!\'94\
\
The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her\
thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had\
rushed on her within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a\
fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to\
her.--How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she had\
been thus practising on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the\
blindness of her own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about,\
she tried her own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every\
posture, she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had\
been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had\
been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she\
was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of\
wretchedness.\
\
To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the first\
endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her father\'92s\
claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.\
\
How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling\
declared him now to be? When had his influence, such influence begun?--\
When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank\
Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;\
she compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in her\
estimation, from the time of the latter\'92s becoming known to her--and as\
they must at any time have been compared by her, had it--oh! had it, by\
any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute the comparison.--She\
saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr.\
Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his regard for her had not\
been infinitely the most dear. She saw, that in persuading herself,\
in fancying, in acting to the contrary, she had been entirely under a\
delusion, totally ignorant of her own heart--and, in short, that she had\
never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!\
\
This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was\
the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which\
she reached; and without being long in reaching it.--She was most\
sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed\
to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--Every other part of her mind\
was disgusting.\
\
With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every\
body\'92s feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every\
body\'92s destiny. She was proved to have been universally mistaken; and\
she had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief. She had\
brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared, on Mr.\
Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on\
her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his\
attachment, she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of\
Harriet\'92s;--and even were this not the case, he would never have known\
Harriet at all but for her folly.\
\
Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every\
wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax\
became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no\
surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or\
thought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her\
side! Such a debasement on his! It was horrible to Emma to think how it\
must sink him in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers,\
the merriment it would prompt at his expense; the mortification and\
disdain of his brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could\
it be?--No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, from\
impossible.--Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities\
to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one, perhaps\
too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was\
it new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent,\
incongruous--or for chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct\
the human fate?\
\
Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward! Had she left her where she\
ought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not, with a\
folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying the\
unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable\
in the line of life to which she ought to belong--all would have been\
safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.\
\
How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to\
Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such\
a man till actually assured of it!--But Harriet was less humble, had\
fewer scruples than formerly.--Her inferiority, whether of mind or\
situation, seemed little felt.--She had seemed more sensible of Mr.\
Elton\'92s being to stoop in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr.\
Knightley\'92s.--Alas! was not that her own doing too? Who had been at\
pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but\
herself had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,\
and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--If\
Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XII\
\
\
Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known\
how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr. Knightley,\
first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feeling\
it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the\
dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had\
been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first; for, having no\
female connexions of his own, there had been only Isabella whose claims\
could be compared with hers, and she had always known exactly how far\
he loved and esteemed Isabella. She had herself been first with him for\
many years past. She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent\
or perverse, slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him,\
insensible of half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would\
not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,\
from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he\
had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour to\
improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no other creature\
had at all shared. In spite of all her faults, she knew she was dear\
to him; might she not say, very dear?--When the suggestions of hope,\
however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she could not\
presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy\
of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.\
_She_ could not. She could not flatter herself with any idea of\
blindness in his attachment to _her_. She had received a very recent\
proof of its impartiality.--How shocked had he been by her behaviour to\
Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he expressed himself to her\
on the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far too\
strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and\
clear-sighted goodwill.--She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name\
of hope, that he could have that sort of affection for herself which was\
now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at\
times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be\
overrating his regard for _her_.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the\
consequence nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.\
Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all, she\
believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue the\
same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley to\
all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious\
intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace would be\
fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her. It would be\
incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with what she felt\
for him. Nothing should separate her from her father. She would not\
marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.\
\
It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she\
hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might at least\
be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should see them\
henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she had\
hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching, she did not know how\
to admit that she could be blinded here.--He was expected back every\
day. The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon it\
appeared when her thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she\
resolved against seeing Harriet.--It would do neither of them good,\
it would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther.--She was\
resolved not to be convinced, as long as she could doubt, and yet had\
no authority for opposing Harriet\'92s confidence. To talk would be only to\
irritate.--She wrote to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg\
that she would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to\
be her conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of _one_\
topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed\
to pass before they met again, except in the company of others--she\
objected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they\
had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and\
approved, and was grateful.\
\
This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma\'92s\
thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,\
sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had\
been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her\
way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to\
relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.\
\
Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates\'92s, and gone through his\
share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having then\
induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned with\
much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter\
of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates\'92s parlour, with all the encumbrance of\
awkward feelings, could have afforded.\
\
A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while her\
friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal\
of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all\
at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and\
to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr.\
Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement\'92s becoming known; as,\
considering every thing, she thought such a visit could not be paid\
without leading to reports:--but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he\
was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her\
family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it;\
or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for \'93such things,\'94\
 he observed, \'93always got about.\'94 Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston\
had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short--and very\
great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She had\
hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn\
how deeply she was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt\
satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her\
daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a\
gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly\
respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation;\
thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of\
themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss\
Fairfax\'92s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to\
invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and declined at first, but,\
on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive,\
Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her\
embarrassment, as to bring her to converse on the important subject.\
Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception,\
and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling\
towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but\
when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the\
present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was\
convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her\
companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been,\
and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject.\
\
\'93On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment of so\
many months,\'94 continued Mrs. Weston, \'93she was energetic. This was one\
of her expressions. \'91I will not say, that since I entered into the\
engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have\
never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:\'92--and the quivering lip,\
Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.\'94\
\
\'93Poor girl!\'94 said Emma. \'93She thinks herself wrong, then, for having\
consented to a private engagement?\'94\
\
\'93Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed\
to blame herself. \'91The consequence,\'92 said she, \'91has been a state of\
perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment\
that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no\
expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all\
my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken,\
and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me\
ought not to be.\'92 \'91Do not imagine, madam,\'92 she continued, \'91that I was\
taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the\
care of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own;\
and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances\
may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel\
Campbell.\'92\'94\
\
\'93Poor girl!\'94 said Emma again. \'93She loves him then excessively, I\
suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she could be\
led to form the engagement. Her affection must have overpowered her\
judgment.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him.\'94\
\
\'93I am afraid,\'94 returned Emma, sighing, \'93that I must often have\
contributed to make her unhappy.\'94\
\
\'93On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she\
probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding to the\
misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before. One natural\
consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,\'94 she said, \'93was\
that of making her _unreasonable_. The consciousness of having done\
amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes, and made her captious\
and irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard for\
him to bear. \'91I did not make the allowances,\'92 said she, \'91which I ought\
to have done, for his temper and spirits--his delightful spirits, and\
that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other\
circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to\
me, as they were at first.\'92 She then began to speak of you, and of the\
great kindness you had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush\
which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had\
an opportunity, to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every\
wish and every endeavour to do her good. She was sensible that you had\
never received any proper acknowledgment from herself.\'94\
\
\'93If I did not know her to be happy now,\'94 said Emma, seriously, \'93which,\
in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience, she\
must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there\
were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss\
Fairfax!--Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this\
is all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting\
particulars. They shew her to the greatest advantage. I am sure she is\
very good--I hope she will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune\
should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.\'94\
\
Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She thought\
well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she loved him\
very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest. She talked with a\
great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but she had too much\
to urge for Emma\'92s attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or\
to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended\
with, \'93We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know,\
but I hope it will soon come,\'94 she was obliged to pause before she\
answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she could at\
all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.\
\
\'93Are you well, my Emma?\'94 was Mrs. Weston\'92s parting question.\
\
\'93Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me\
intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.\'94\
\
Mrs. Weston\'92s communications furnished Emma with more food for\
unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion, and her\
sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She bitterly regretted\
not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed for the\
envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.\
Had she followed Mr. Knightley\'92s known wishes, in paying that attention\
to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she tried to know her\
better; had she done her part towards intimacy; had she endeavoured\
to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she must, in all\
probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her\
now.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as\
an associate for her, to be received with gratitude; and the other--what\
was she?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends;\
that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax\'92s confidence on this\
important matter--which was most probable--still, in knowing her as\
she ought, and as she might, she must have been preserved from the\
abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she\
had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so\
unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a\
subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane\'92s feelings, by the\
levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill\'92s. Of all the sources of evil\
surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury, she was persuaded\
that she must herself have been the worst. She must have been a\
perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without\
her having stabbed Jane Fairfax\'92s peace in a thousand instances; and on\
Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no\
more.\
\
The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.\
The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and\
nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was\
despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights\
the longer visible.\
\
The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably\
comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter\'92s side, and by\
exertions which had never cost her half so much before. It reminded\
her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston\'92s\
wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea,\
and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of\
Hartfield\'92s attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly\
be over. The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the\
approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them,\
no pleasures had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared\
would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her now,\
was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--that\
might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that\
might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must be\
comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the\
spirits only of ruined happiness.\
\
The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than\
herself; and Mrs. Weston\'92s heart and time would be occupied by it.\
They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure, her husband\
also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss\
Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to\
Highbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe.\
All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the\
loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or\
of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer\
coming there for his evening comfort!--No longer walking in at all\
hours, as if ever willing to change his own home for their\'92s!--How was\
it to be endured? And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet\'92s sake;\
if he were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet\'92s society\
all that he wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first,\
the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for all the best\
blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma\'92s wretchedness but\
the reflection never far distant from her mind, that it had been all her\
own work?\
\
When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain from\
a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a\
few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation\
or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own better\
conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might\
be the following and every future winter of her life to the past, it\
would yet find her more rational, more acquainted with herself, and\
leave her less to regret when it were gone.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIII\
\
\
The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and\
the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at\
Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a\
softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was\
summer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma\
resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite\
sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after\
a storm, been more attractive to her. She longed for the serenity they\
might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry\'92s coming in soon after\
dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time\
in hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened, and\
thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she saw Mr.\
Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her.--It\
was the first intimation of his being returned from London. She had\
been thinking of him the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles\
distant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She\
must be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The\
\'93How d\'92ye do\'92s\'94 were quiet and constrained on each side. She asked after\
their mutual friends; they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only\
that morning. He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with\
her, she found. \'93He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he was\
not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.\'94--She thought he neither\
looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it,\
suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been communicating his\
plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had\
been received.\
\
They walked together. He was silent. She thought he was often looking\
at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to\
give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he wanted to\
speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet; he might be watching for\
encouragement to begin.--She did not, could not, feel equal to lead the\
way to any such subject. He must do it all himself. Yet she could\
not bear this silence. With him it was most unnatural. She\
considered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began--\
\
\'93You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather\
surprize you.\'94\
\
\'93Have I?\'94 said he quietly, and looking at her; \'93of what nature?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.\'94\
\
After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more, he\
replied,\
\
\'93If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that\
already.\'94\
\
\'93How is it possible?\'94 cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks towards\
him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he might have called\
at Mrs. Goddard\'92s in his way.\
\
\'93I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and\
at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened.\'94\
\
Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more\
composure,\
\
\'93_You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have\
had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give\
me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking voice\
and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.\'94\
\
For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious of having\
excited any particular interest, till she found her arm drawn within\
his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him thus saying, in a tone\
of great sensibility, speaking low,\
\
\'93Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent\
sense--your exertions for your father\'92s sake--I know you will not allow\
yourself--.\'94 Her arm was pressed again, as he added, in a more\
broken and subdued accent, \'93The feelings of the warmest\
friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!\'94--And in a louder,\
steadier tone, he concluded with, \'93He will soon be gone. They will soon\
be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for _her_. She deserves a better fate.\'94\
\
Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter\
of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,\
\
\'93You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--\
I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was\
going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed\
of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may\
well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason\
to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.\'94\
\
\'93Emma!\'94 cried he, looking eagerly at her, \'93are you, indeed?\'94--but\
checking himself--\'93No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am pleased\
that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret, indeed! and\
it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment\
of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not\
farther entangled!--I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure\
myself as to the degree of what you felt--I could only be certain that\
there was a preference--and a preference which I never believed him to\
deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he to be rewarded\
with that sweet young woman?--Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable\
creature.\'94\
\
\'93Mr. Knightley,\'94 said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--\'93I\
am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your\
error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I\
have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been\
at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural\
for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--But I never\
have.\'94\
\
He listened in perfect silence. She wished him to speak, but he would\
not. She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his\
clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in\
his opinion. She went on, however.\
\
\'93I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his\
attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--An old story,\
probably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds of my\
sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up\
as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation.\
He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was continually here--I always found\
him very pleasant--and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the\
causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last--my vanity\
was flattered, and I allowed his attentions. Latterly, however--for some\
time, indeed--I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought\
them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.\
He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me. I have never been\
attached to him. And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour. He\
never wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his real\
situation with another.--It was his object to blind all about him; and\
no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself--except\
that I was _not_ blinded--that it was my good fortune--that, in short, I\
was somehow or other safe from him.\'94\
\
She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her\
conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far as she\
could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his usual tone,\
he said,\
\
\'93I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,\
however, that I may have underrated him. My acquaintance with him has\
been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him hitherto, he\
may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has a chance.--I have no\
motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake, whose happiness will be\
involved in his good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him\
well.\'94\
\
\'93I have no doubt of their being happy together,\'94 said Emma; \'93I believe\
them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.\'94\
\
\'93He is a most fortunate man!\'94 returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. \'93So\
early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chuses a\
wife, he generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such\
a prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation,\
has before him!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterested\
love, for Jane Fairfax\'92s character vouches for her disinterestedness;\
every thing in his favour,--equality of situation--I mean, as far as\
regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important;\
equality in every point but one--and that one, since the purity of her\
heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his felicity, for it\
will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants.--A man would always\
wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from;\
and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of _her_ regard, must,\
I think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the\
favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets\
with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even\
weary her by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought\
round the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found\
her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has only to\
speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--He had used\
every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--He is a\
fortunate man indeed!\'94\
\
\'93You speak as if you envied him.\'94\
\
\'93And I do envy him, Emma. In one respect he is the object of my envy.\'94\
\
Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence\
of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if\
possible. She made her plan; she would speak of something totally\
different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for\
breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,\
\
\'93You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, I\
see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but _I_ cannot be wise. Emma,\
I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the\
next moment.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! then, don\'92t speak it, don\'92t speak it,\'94 she eagerly cried. \'93Take a\
little time, consider, do not commit yourself.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you,\'94 said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not\
another syllable followed.\
\
Emma could not bear to give him pain. He was wishing to confide in\
her--perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.\
She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it; she might give\
just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him his own independence,\
relieve him from that state of indecision, which must be more\
intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his.--They had\
reached the house.\
\
\'93You are going in, I suppose?\'94 said he.\
\
\'93No,\'94--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which\
he still spoke--\'93I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not\
gone.\'94 And, after proceeding a few steps, she added--\'93I stopped you\
ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you\
pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or\
to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--as\
a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like. I\
will tell you exactly what I think.\'94\
\
\'93As a friend!\'94--repeated Mr. Knightley.--\'93Emma, that I fear is a\
word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--I\
have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your\
offer--Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to\
you as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?\'94\
\
He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression\
of his eyes overpowered her.\
\
\'93My dearest Emma,\'94 said he, \'93for dearest you will always be, whatever\
the event of this hour\'92s conversation, my dearest, most beloved\
Emma--tell me at once. Say \'91No,\'92 if it is to be said.\'94--She could\
really say nothing.--\'93You are silent,\'94 he cried, with great animation;\
\'93absolutely silent! at present I ask no more.\'94\
\
Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The\
dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most\
prominent feeling.\
\
\'93I cannot make speeches, Emma:\'94 he soon resumed; and in a tone of\
such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably\
convincing.--\'93If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it\
more. But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I\
have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other\
woman in England would have borne it.--Bear with the truths I would\
tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The\
manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have\
been a very indifferent lover.--But you understand me.--Yes, you see,\
you understand my feelings--and will return them if you can. At present,\
I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice.\'94\
\
While he spoke, Emma\'92s mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful\
velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--to\
catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet\'92s\
hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a\
delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing; that she was every\
thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet\
had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her\
agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all\
received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time\
for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there\
was time also to rejoice that Harriet\'92s secret had not escaped her, and\
to resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service\
she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of\
sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his\
affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the\
two--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at\
once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not\
marry them both, Emma had it not. She felt for Harriet, with pain and\
with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that\
could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain. She had led her\
friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her for ever; but her\
judgment was as strong as her feelings, and as strong as it had ever\
been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him, as most unequal\
and degrading. Her way was clear, though not quite smooth.--She spoke\
then, on being so entreated.--What did she say?--Just what she ought,\
of course. A lady always does.--She said enough to shew there need not\
be despair--and to invite him to say more himself. He _had_ despaired at\
one period; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence,\
as for the time crushed every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear\
him.--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of\
taking another turn, her renewing the conversation which she had\
just put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its\
inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it,\
and seek no farther explanation.\
\
Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;\
seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a\
little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is\
mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--Mr.\
Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she\
possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.\
\
He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence. He had\
followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He had come,\
in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill\'92s engagement, with no\
selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she allowed him an\
opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest had been the work of\
the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard, on his feelings. The\
delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill,\
of her having a heart completely disengaged from him, had given birth\
to the hope, that, in time, he might gain her affection himself;--but\
it had been no present hope--he had only, in the momentary conquest of\
eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she did not forbid his\
attempt to attach her.--The superior hopes which gradually opened were\
so much the more enchanting.--The affection, which he had been asking\
to be allowed to create, if he could, was already his!--Within half\
an hour, he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to\
something so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.\
\
_Her_ change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the same\
precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same\
degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side, there had been\
a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation,\
of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank\
Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably\
enlightened him as to the other. It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill\
that had taken him from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided\
him on going away. He would save himself from witnessing again\
such permitted, encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be\
indifferent.--But he had gone to a wrong place. There was too much\
domestic happiness in his brother\'92s house; woman wore too amiable a form\
in it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking\
inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before\
him, for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had\
stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning\'92s\
post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the gladness\
which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel, having never\
believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much\
fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her, that he could stay no\
longer. He had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly\
after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures,\
faultless in spite of all her faults, bore the discovery.\
\
He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--\
He heard her declare that she had never loved him. Frank Churchill\'92s\
character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,\
when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought of Frank\
Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIV\
\
\
What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from\
what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope for\
a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite flutter of\
happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be\
greater when the flutter should have passed away.\
\
They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--how often\
it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen on the same\
shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the\
western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing\
like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her\
usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive\
daughter.\
\
Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the\
breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously\
hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he have seen the\
heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the\
most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest\
perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either,\
he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had\
received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment,\
totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return.\
\
As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma\'92s fever continued;\
but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and\
subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax\
for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points\
to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some\
alloy. Her father--and Harriet. She could not be alone without feeling\
the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort\
of both to the utmost, was the question. With respect to her father,\
it was a question soon answered. She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley\
would ask; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most\
solemn resolution of never quitting her father.--She even wept over\
the idea of it, as a sin of thought. While he lived, it must be only an\
engagement; but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of\
drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--How\
to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--how to spare\
her from any unnecessary pain; how to make her any possible atonement;\
how to appear least her enemy?--On these subjects, her perplexity\
and distress were very great--and her mind had to pass again and\
again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever\
surrounded it.--She could only resolve at last, that she would still\
avoid a meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by\
letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed\
just now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme\
more--nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation\
for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;\
and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--She did\
not think it in Harriet\'92s nature to escape being benefited by novelty\
and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--At any rate,\
it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom\
every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the\
evil day, when they must all be together again.\
\
She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment which\
left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking\
up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half\
an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him,\
literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her in a\
proper share of the happiness of the evening before.\
\
He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have the\
slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was\
brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed what it\
must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--She was now\
in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted no explanations, she\
wanted only to have her thoughts to herself--and as for understanding\
any thing he wrote, she was sure she was incapable of it.--It must be\
waded through, however. She opened the packet; it was too surely so;--a\
note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to\
Mrs. Weston.\
\
\'93I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the\
enclosed. I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely\
a doubt of its happy effect.--I think we shall never materially disagree\
about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We\
are quite well.--This letter has been the cure of all the little\
nervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks\
on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never\
own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east\
wind.--I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday\
afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last\
night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.\
\
                              \'93Yours ever,\
                                                       \'93A. W.\'94\
\
                       [To Mrs. Weston.]\
\
\
                                                       WINDSOR-JULY.\
MY DEAR MADAM,\
\
\'93If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be\
expected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and\
indulgence.--You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of\
even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--But\
I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent. My courage\
rises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be\
humble. I have already met with such success in two applications for\
pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours,\
and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You\
must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I\
first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret which\
was to be kept at all hazards. This was the fact. My right to place\
myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.\
I shall not discuss it here. For my temptation to _think_ it a right,\
I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and\
casements above, in Highbury. I dared not address her openly; my\
difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to\
require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we\
parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the\
creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--Had she refused, I\
should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say, what was your\
hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--To any thing, every\
thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts,\
perseverance and weariness, health and sickness. Every possibility of\
good was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her\
promises of faith and correspondence. If you need farther explanation,\
I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband\'92s son, and\
the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which no\
inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See\
me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to\
Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have\
been sooner paid. You will look back and see that I did not come till\
Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as _you_ were the person slighted, you\
will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father\'92s compassion, by\
reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house, so long\
I lost the blessing of knowing you. My behaviour, during the very\
happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to\
reprehension, excepting on one point. And now I come to the principal,\
the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which\
excites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation. With\
the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss\
Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest\
humiliation.--A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his\
opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour\
to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--In order to\
assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than\
an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately\
thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but\
I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been\
convinced of her indifference, I would not have been induced by any\
selfish views to go on.--Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is,\
she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and\
that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me,\
was as much my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with\
an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.\
We seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those\
attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss Woodhouse\
began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight,\
I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her, I remember that I was\
within a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she was not\
without suspicion; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me,\
at least in some degree.--She may not have surmised the whole, but her\
quickness must have penetrated a part. I cannot doubt it. You will find,\
whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it\
did not take her wholly by surprize. She frequently gave me hints of it.\
I remember her telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude\
for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--I hope this history of my conduct\
towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation\
of what you saw amiss. While you considered me as having sinned against\
Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. Acquit me here, and\
procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes\
of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly\
affection, as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as\
myself.--Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight,\
you have now a key to. My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to\
get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.\
If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--Of\
the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that\
its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would never\
have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--The\
delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam,\
is much beyond my power of doing justice to. You will soon, I earnestly\
hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--No description can describe her.\
She must tell you herself what she is--yet not by word, for never\
was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own\
merit.--Since I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw,\
I have heard from her.--She gives a good account of her own health; but\
as she never complains, I dare not depend. I want to have your opinion\
of her looks. I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread\
of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already. Let me hear from you without\
delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. Remember how few\
minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and\
I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or\
misery. When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her\
excellence and patience, and my uncle\'92s generosity, I am mad with joy:\
but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her, and how little\
I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger. If I could but see her\
again!--But I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me\
to encroach.--I must still add to this long letter. You have not heard\
all that you ought to hear. I could not give any connected detail\
yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness\
with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event\
of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the\
happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures,\
but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to\
lose. I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she\
would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and\
refinement.--But I had no choice. The hasty engagement she had entered\
into with that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off\
abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over\
the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of\
my letter what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying\
retrospect for me. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that\
my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly\
blameable. _She_ disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My\
plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was\
displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her, on a thousand\
occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her even\
cold. But she was always right. If I had followed her judgment, and\
subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have\
escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--\
Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--_There_ every little\
dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. I was late;\
I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her, but she\
would not suffer it. She absolutely refused to allow me, which I then\
thought most unreasonable. Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very\
natural and consistent degree of discretion. While I, to blind the\
world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable\
particularity to another woman, was she to be consenting the next to a\
proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had we\
been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must\
have been suspected.--I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted\
her affection. I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when,\
provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect\
of her, and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been\
impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her resentment in\
a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--In short, my dear\
madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side, abominable on mine; and\
I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with\
you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with\
her as possible. Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to\
be reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her\
coldness, and I went away determined that she should make the first\
advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of\
the Box Hill party. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly\
suppose you would ever have thought well of me again. Its effect upon\
her appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she\
found I was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that\
officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her, by the\
bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred. I must not quarrel\
with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards\
myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it\
which that woman has known.--\'91Jane,\'92 indeed!--You will observe that I\
have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name, even to you.\
Think, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between\
the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the\
insolence of imaginary superiority. Have patience with me, I shall soon\
have done.--She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me\
entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet\
again.--_She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_\
_repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_: _she_ _dissolved_ _it_.--This\
letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt\'92s death. I\
answered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the\
multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of\
being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in\
my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but\
a few lines, to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was\
rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily; but I\
made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--too cheerful\
in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor; and two\
days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters all\
returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her\
extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last; and\
adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued,\
and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate\
arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she now sent me, by a safe\
conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly\
command hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would\
forward them after that period to her at--: in short, the full direction\
to Mr. Smallridge\'92s, near Bristol, stared me in the face. I knew the\
name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had\
been doing. It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character\
which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained, as to\
any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive of its\
anxious delicacy. For the world would not she have seemed to threaten\
me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my\
own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--What was to be\
done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle. Without his sanction I\
could not hope to be listened to again.--I spoke; circumstances were\
in my favour; the late event had softened away his pride, and he was,\
earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying;\
and could say at last, poor man! with a deep sigh, that he wished I\
might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done.--I\
felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity\
me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my\
suspense while all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached\
Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her. Do not pity me till I saw her\
wan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my\
knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance\
of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was not\
disappointed either in the object of my journey. A great deal of very\
reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away. But it is\
done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment\'92s\
uneasiness can ever occur between us again. Now, my dear madam, I will\
release you; but I could not conclude before. A thousand and a thousand\
thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for\
the attentions your heart will dictate towards her.--If you think me in\
a way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss\
W. calls me the child of good fortune. I hope she is right.--In one\
respect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe\
myself,\
\
                    Your obliged and affectionate Son,\
\
                                          F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XV\
\
\
This letter must make its way to Emma\'92s feelings. She was obliged, in\
spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the\
justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name,\
it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting,\
and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject\
could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard\
for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of\
love must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till she had gone\
through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had\
been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had\
suffered, and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and\
so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that\
there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must\
have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.\
\
She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,\
she desired him to read it. She was sure of Mrs. Weston\'92s wishing it to\
be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so\
much to blame in his conduct.\
\
\'93I shall be very glad to look it over,\'94 said he; \'93but it seems long. I\
will take it home with me at night.\'94\
\
But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she\
must return it by him.\
\
\'93I would rather be talking to you,\'94 he replied; \'93but as it seems a\
matter of justice, it shall be done.\'94\
\
He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, \'93Had I been offered\
the sight of one of this gentleman\'92s letters to his mother-in-law a few\
months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.\'94\
\
He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a\
smile, observed, \'93Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his\
way. One man\'92s style must not be the rule of another\'92s. We will not be\
severe.\'94\
\
\'93It will be natural for me,\'94 he added shortly afterwards, \'93to speak my\
opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you.\
It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--\'94\
\
\'93Not at all. I should wish it.\'94\
\
Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.\
\
\'93He trifles here,\'94 said he, \'93as to the temptation. He knows he is wrong,\
and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought not to have formed the\
engagement.--\'91His father\'92s disposition:\'92--he is unjust, however, to his\
father. Mr. Weston\'92s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright\
and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort\
before he endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss\
Fairfax was here.\'94\
\
\'93And I have not forgotten,\'94 said Emma, \'93how sure you were that he might\
have come sooner if he would. You pass it over very handsomely--but you\
were perfectly right.\'94\
\
\'93I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--had\
_you_ not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him.\'94\
\
When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole of it\
aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look; a shake of the\
head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as\
the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady\
reflection, thus--\
\
\'93Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous\
game. Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--No judge of\
his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his own wishes, and\
regardless of little besides his own convenience.--Fancying you to have\
fathomed his secret. Natural enough!--his own mind full of intrigue,\
that he should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert\
the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more\
and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each\
other?\'94\
\
Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet\'92s account,\
which she could not give any sincere explanation of.\
\
\'93You had better go on,\'94 said she.\
\
He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, \'93the pianoforte! Ah! That\
was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether\
the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A\
boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man\'92s wishing to give a\
woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense\
with; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument\'92s\
coming if she could.\'94\
\
After this, he made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill\'92s\
confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for\
more than a word in passing.\
\
\'93I perfectly agree with you, sir,\'94--was then his remark. \'93You did behave\
very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.\'94 And having gone through\
what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his\
persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax\'92s sense of right,\
he made a fuller pause to say, \'93This is very bad.--He had induced her\
to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and\
uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from\
suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend\
with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He should have\
respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were\
all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that she\
had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she\
should have been in such a state of punishment.\'94\
\
Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew\
uncomfortable. Her own behaviour had been so very improper! She was\
deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look. It was all read,\
however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and,\
excepting one momentary glance at her, instantly withdrawn, in the fear\
of giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.\
\
\'93There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the\
Eltons,\'94 was his next observation.--\'93His feelings are natural.--What!\
actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt the engagement to\
be a source of repentance and misery to each--she dissolved it.--What a\
view this gives of her sense of his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most\
extraordinary--\'94\
\
\'93Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers.\'94\
\
\'93I hope he does,\'94 replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.\
\'93\'91Smallridge!\'92--What does this mean? What is all this?\'94\
\
\'93She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge\'92s children--a\
dear friend of Mrs. Elton\'92s--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the\
bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?\'94\
\
\'93Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even of\
Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter\
the man writes!\'94\
\
\'93I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him.\'94\
\
\'93Well, there _is_ feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in\
finding her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of\
her. \'91Dearer, much dearer than ever.\'92 I hope he may long continue to\
feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal\
thanker, with his thousands and tens of thousands.--\'91Happier than I\
deserve.\'92 Come, he knows himself there. \'91Miss Woodhouse calls me the\
child of good fortune.\'92--Those were Miss Woodhouse\'92s words, were they?--\
And a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child of good fortune!\
That was your name for him, was it?\'94\
\
\'93You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still\
you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I\
hope it does him some service with you.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, certainly it does. He has had great faults, faults of\
inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion\
in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he\
is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it\
may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am very\
ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers the\
steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk\
to you of something else. I have another person\'92s interest at present\
so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.\
Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work\
on one subject.\'94\
\
The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike\
English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love\
with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the\
happiness of her father. Emma\'92s answer was ready at the first word.\
\'93While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible\
for her. She could never quit him.\'94 Part only of this answer, however,\
was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr.\
Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any\
other change, he could not agree to. He had been thinking it over most\
deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to\
remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but\
his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself\
long; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation\
would be a risk of her father\'92s comfort, perhaps even of his life, which\
must not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt\
that it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the\
sacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any\
respect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield;\
that so long as her father\'92s happiness--in other words, his life--required\
Hartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.\
\
Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing\
thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such\
an alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all\
the affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must\
be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that\
in living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there\
would be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it,\
and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no\
reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had\
given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had\
been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his\
thoughts to himself.\
\
\'93Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,\'94 cried Emma. \'93I am sure\
William Larkins will not like it. You must get his consent before you\
ask mine.\'94\
\
She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised,\
moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good\
scheme.\
\
It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in\
which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never\
struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as\
heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she must\
of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only\
gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in\
detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley\'92s\
marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had\
wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.\
\
This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at\
Hartfield--the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.\
His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase, their mutual\
good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the\
periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--Such a partner in\
all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of\
melancholy!\
\
She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing\
of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend,\
who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family\
party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere\
charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in\
every way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction\
from her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a\
dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a\
peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of\
unmerited punishment.\
\
In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,\
supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr.\
Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--not\
like Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly\
considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped\
than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she\
could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVI\
\
\
It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as\
herself to avoid a meeting. Their intercourse was painful enough by\
letter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!\
\
Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without\
reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there\
was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her style,\
which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--It might be\
only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have\
been quite without resentment under such a stroke.\
\
She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella\'92s invitation; and she was\
fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting\
to invention.--There was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and\
had wished some time, to consult a dentist. Mrs. John Knightley was\
delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to\
her--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was\
quite eager to have Harriet under her care.--When it was thus settled\
on her sister\'92s side, Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her\
very persuadable.--Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a\
fortnight; she was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse\'92s carriage.--It was\
all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick\
Square.\
\
Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley\'92s visits; now she could\
talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense\
of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her\
when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her, how much might\
at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings\
which she had led astray herself.\
\
The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard\'92s, or in London, made perhaps\
an unreasonable difference in Emma\'92s sensations; but she could not think\
of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must\
be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.\
\
She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place\
in her mind which Harriet had occupied. There was a communication before\
her, one which _she_ only could be competent to make--the confession of\
her engagement to her father; but she would have nothing to do with it\
at present.--She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston\
were safe and well. No additional agitation should be thrown at this\
period among those she loved--and the evil should not act on herself\
by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of\
leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating,\
delight, should be hers.\
\
She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an\
hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--She ought\
to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of their present\
situations increasing every other motive of goodwill. It would be a\
_secret_ satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect\
would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any\
thing Jane might communicate.\
\
She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not\
been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had\
been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the\
worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--The fear of being still\
unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to\
wait in the passage, and send up her name.--She heard Patty announcing\
it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so\
happily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of,\
\'93Beg her to walk up;\'94--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs\
by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her\
were felt sufficient.--Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely,\
so engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was\
every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--\
She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very\
feeling tone,\
\
\'93This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me\
to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely\
without words.\'94\
\
Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the\
sound of Mrs. Elton\'92s voice from the sitting-room had not checked\
her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her\
congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.\
\
Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which\
accounted for the previous tranquillity. Emma could have wished Mrs.\
Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience with every\
body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness, she hoped the\
rencontre would do them no harm.\
\
She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton\'92s thoughts, and\
understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in\
Miss Fairfax\'92s confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was\
still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in\
the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs.\
Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady\'92s replies, she saw\
her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she\
had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into\
the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,\
\
\'93We can finish this some other time, you know. You and I shall not want\
opportunities. And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I\
only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is\
not offended. You see how delightfully she writes. Oh! she is a sweet\
creature! You would have doated on her, had you gone.--But not a word\
more. Let us be discreet--quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You\
remember those lines--I forget the poem at this moment:\
\
        \'93For when a lady\'92s in the case,\
        \'93You know all other things give place.\'94\
\
Now I say, my dear, in _our_ case, for _lady_, read----mum! a word to\
the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an\'92t I? But I want to set\
your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see, has\
quite appeased her.\'94\
\
And again, on Emma\'92s merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates\'92s\
knitting, she added, in a half whisper,\
\
\'93I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as a\
minister of state. I managed it extremely well.\'94\
\
Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every\
possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of\
the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,\
\
\'93Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is\
charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest\
credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my\
word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--Oh! if you had\
seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!\'94--And when Mrs. Bates\
was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, \'93We do not say a word\
of any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young\
physician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit.\'94\
\
\'93I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,\'94 she\
shortly afterwards began, \'93since the party to Box Hill. Very pleasant\
party. But yet I think there was something wanting. Things did not\
seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So\
it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken. However, I think\
it answered so far as to tempt one to go again. What say you both to our\
collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the\
fine weather lasts?--It must be the same party, you know, quite the\
same party, not _one_ exception.\'94\
\
Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being\
diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting,\
she supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say\
every thing.\
\
\'93Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible\
to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane\'92s prospects--that\
is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--How is Mr.\
Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--Such a happy little\
circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--Charming young man!--that\
is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--such attention to\
Jane!\'94--And from her great, her more than commonly thankful delight\
towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a\
little show of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter,\
which was now graciously overcome.--After a few whispers, indeed, which\
placed it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,\
\
\'93Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that\
anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth\
is, that I am waiting for my lord and master. He promised to join me\
here, and pay his respects to you.\'94\
\
\'93What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--That will\
be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and\
Mr. Elton\'92s time is so engaged.\'94\
\
\'93Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning to\
night.--There is no end of people\'92s coming to him, on some pretence or\
other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens, are always\
wanting his opinion. They seem not able to do any thing without\
him.--\'91Upon my word, Mr. E.,\'92 I often say, \'91rather you than I.--I do\
not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument, if I had\
half so many applicants.\'92--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect\
them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar\
this fortnight.--However, he is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on\
purpose to wait on you all.\'94 And putting up her hand to screen her\
words from Emma--\'93A congratulatory visit, you know.--Oh! yes, quite\
indispensable.\'94\
\
Miss Bates looked about her, so happily--!\
\
\'93He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself\
from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep\
consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley\'92s right hand.\'94\
\
Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, \'93Is Mr. Elton\
gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. Weston and\
Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who\
lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.\'94\
\
\'93Have not you mistaken the day?\'94 said Emma. \'93I am almost certain that\
the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley was at\
Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day,\'94 was the abrupt answer, which\
denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton\'92s side.--\'93I do\
believe,\'94 she continued, \'93this is the most troublesome parish that ever\
was. We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.\'94\
\
\'93Your parish there was small,\'94 said Jane.\
\
\'93Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject\
talked of.\'94\
\
\'93But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard\
you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the\
only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.\'94\
\
\'93Ah! you clever creature, that\'92s very true. What a thinking brain you\
have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should make, if we\
could be shaken together. My liveliness and your solidity would produce\
perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that _some_\
people may not think _you_ perfection already.--But hush!--not a word,\
if you please.\'94\
\
It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,\
not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.\
The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted, was very\
evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.\
\
Mr. Elton made his appearance. His lady greeted him with some of her\
sparkling vivacity.\
\
\'93Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an\
encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--But\
you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with. You knew I should\
not stir till my lord and master appeared.--Here have I been sitting\
this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal\
obedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?\'94\
\
Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.\
His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent\
object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering, and the\
walk he had had for nothing.\
\
\'93When I got to Donwell,\'94 said he, \'93Knightley could not be found. Very\
odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning, and the\
message he returned, that he should certainly be at home till one.\'94\
\
\'93Donwell!\'94 cried his wife.--\'93My dear Mr. E., you have not been to\
Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.\'94\
\
\'93No, no, that\'92s to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley\
to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--I went\
over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,) which made\
it so much the worse. And then not to find him at home! I assure you\
I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The\
housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected.--Very\
extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone. Perhaps\
to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--Miss\
Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it?\'94\
\
Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,\
indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.\
\
\'93I cannot imagine,\'94 said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife\
ought to do,) \'93I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you, of\
all people in the world! The very last person whom one should expect to\
be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you, I am\
sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--and his\
servants forgot it. Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely\
to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed,\
extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a\
creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration. And\
as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her very cheap indeed.--She promised\
Wright a receipt, and never sent it.\'94\
\
\'93I met William Larkins,\'94 continued Mr. Elton, \'93as I got near the house,\
and he told me I should not find his master at home, but I did not\
believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour. He did not know what\
was come to his master lately, he said, but he could hardly ever get the\
speech of him. I have nothing to do with William\'92s wants, but it really\
is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to-day; and it\
becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should\
have had this hot walk to no purpose.\'94\
\
Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly. In\
all probability she was at this very time waited for there; and Mr.\
Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards\
Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.\
\
She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to\
attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs; it gave her\
an opportunity which she immediately made use of, to say,\
\
\'93It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility. Had you\
not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been tempted to\
introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more openly than might\
have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should certainly have been\
impertinent.\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94 cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought\
infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual\
composure--\'93there would have been no danger. The danger would have\
been of my wearying you. You could not have gratified me more than\
by expressing an interest--. Indeed, Miss Woodhouse, (speaking more\
collectedly,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct, very\
great misconduct, it is particularly consoling to me to know that those\
of my friends, whose good opinion is most worth preserving, are not\
disgusted to such a degree as to--I have not time for half that I could\
wish to say. I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for\
myself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your\
compassion does not stand my friend--\'94\
\
\'93Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are,\'94 cried Emma warmly, and\
taking her hand. \'93You owe me no apologies; and every body to whom you\
might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied, so delighted\
even--\'94\
\
\'93You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--So\
cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life of\
deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you.\'94\
\
\'93Pray say no more. I feel that all the apologies should be on my side.\
Let us forgive each other at once. We must do whatever is to be done\
quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there. I hope you\
have pleasant accounts from Windsor?\'94\
\
\'93Very.\'94\
\
\'93And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--just as\
I begin to know you.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet. I am here\
till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.\'94\
\
\'93Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps,\'94 replied Emma,\
smiling--\'93but, excuse me, it must be thought of.\'94\
\
The smile was returned as Jane answered,\
\
\'93You are very right; it has been thought of. And I will own to you, (I\
am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living with Mr. Churchill\
at Enscombe, it is settled. There must be three months, at least, of\
deep mourning; but when they are over, I imagine there will be nothing\
more to wait for.\'94\
\
\'93Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured\
of.--Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and\
open!--Good-bye, good-bye.\'94\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVII\
\
\
Mrs. Weston\'92s friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the\
satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by\
knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in\
wishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with\
any view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella\'92s\
sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father\
and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew\
older--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to\
have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks\
and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--no\
one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be\
quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have\
their powers in exercise again.\
\
\'93She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,\'94 she\
continued--\'93like La Baronne d\'92Almane on La Comtesse d\'92Ostalis, in Madame\
de Genlis\'92 Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her own little\
Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan.\'94\
\
\'93That is,\'94 replied Mr. Knightley, \'93she will indulge her even more than\
she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will\
be the only difference.\'94\
\
\'93Poor child!\'94 cried Emma; \'93at that rate, what will become of her?\'94\
\
\'93Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable\
in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older. I am losing all my\
bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all\
my happiness to _you_, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be\
severe on them?\'94\
\
Emma laughed, and replied: \'93But I had the assistance of all your\
endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether\
my own sense would have corrected me without it.\'94\
\
\'93Do you?--I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:--Miss Taylor\
gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite\
as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what\
right has he to lecture me?--and I am afraid very natural for you to\
feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did\
you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the\
tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without\
doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,\
have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.\'94\
\
\'93I am sure you were of use to me,\'94 cried Emma. \'93I was very often\
influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time. I\
am very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be\
spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her\
as you have done for me, except falling in love with her when she is\
thirteen.\'94\
\
\'93How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your\
saucy looks--\'91Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I\
may, or I have Miss Taylor\'92s leave\'92--something which, you knew, I\
did not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad\
feelings instead of one.\'94\
\
\'93What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches\
in such affectionate remembrance.\'94\
\
\'93\'91Mr. Knightley.\'92--You always called me, \'91Mr. Knightley;\'92 and, from\
habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal. I want\
you to call me something else, but I do not know what.\'94\
\
\'93I remember once calling you \'91George,\'92 in one of my amiable fits, about\
ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as\
you made no objection, I never did it again.\'94\
\
\'93And cannot you call me \'91George\'92 now?\'94\
\
\'93Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but \'91Mr. Knightley.\'92 I\
will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by\
calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,\'94 she added presently, laughing\
and blushing--\'93I will promise to call you once by your Christian name.\
I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in\
which N. takes M. for better, for worse.\'94\
\
Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important\
service which his better sense would have rendered her, to the\
advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly\
follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a\
subject.--She could not enter on it.--Harriet was very seldom mentioned\
between them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being\
thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy,\
and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were\
declining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other\
circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that\
her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on\
Isabella\'92s letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being\
obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior to\
the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.\
\
Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be\
expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which\
appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but,\
since that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet\
different from what she had known her before.--Isabella, to be sure,\
was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing\
with the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma\'92s comforts and\
hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet\'92s being to stay longer;\
her fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John\
Knightley were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain\
till they could bring her back.\
\
\'93John does not even mention your friend,\'94 said Mr. Knightley. \'93Here is\
his answer, if you like to see it.\'94\
\
It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage. Emma\
accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know\
what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her\
friend was unmentioned.\
\
\'93John enters like a brother into my happiness,\'94 continued Mr. Knightley,\
\'93but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,\
likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from making\
flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather cool in\
her praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes.\'94\
\
\'93He writes like a sensible man,\'94 replied Emma, when she had read the\
letter. \'93I honour his sincerity. It is very plain that he considers the\
good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he is not\
without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as\
you think me already. Had he said any thing to bear a different\
construction, I should not have believed him.\'94\
\
\'93My Emma, he means no such thing. He only means--\'94\
\
\'93He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,\'94\
 interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--\'93much less, perhaps, than\
he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the\
subject.\'94\
\
\'93Emma, my dear Emma--\'94\
\
\'93Oh!\'94 she cried with more thorough gaiety, \'93if you fancy your brother\
does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret,\
and hear his opinion. Depend upon it, he will be much farther from doing\
_you_ justice. He will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on\
your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not\
sink into \'91poor Emma\'92 with him at once.--His tender compassion towards\
oppressed worth can go no farther.\'94\
\
\'93Ah!\'94 he cried, \'93I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as\
John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be\
happy together. I am amused by one part of John\'92s letter--did you notice\
it?--where he says, that my information did not take him wholly by\
surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the\
kind.\'94\
\
\'93If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having\
some thoughts of marrying. He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly\
unprepared for that.\'94\
\
\'93Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my\
feelings. What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious of any\
difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at\
this time for my marrying any more than at another.--But it was so, I\
suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them\
the other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much\
as usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, \'91Uncle seems\
always tired now.\'92\'94\
\
The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other\
persons\'92 reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently\
recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse\'92s visits, Emma having it in view that\
her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to\
announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--But how to break it to her\
father at last!--She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr.\
Knightley\'92s absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have\
failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come\
at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was\
forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a\
more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.\
She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she\
could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then,\
in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be\
obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty,\
since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--she and Mr.\
Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the\
constant addition of that person\'92s company whom she knew he loved, next\
to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.\
\
Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried\
earnestly to dissuade her from it. She was reminded, more than once, of\
having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be\
a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella,\
and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do. Emma hung about him\
affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must\
not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them\
from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not\
going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing\
no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she\
was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr.\
Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.--Did\
he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--He would not deny that he did,\
she was sure.--Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr.\
Knightley?--Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters,\
who so glad to assist him?--Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached\
to him?--Would not he like to have him always on the spot?--Yes. That\
was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should\
be glad to see him every day;--but they did see him every day as it\
was.--Why could not they go on as they had done?\
\
Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,\
the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--To\
Emma\'92s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley\'92s, whose fond\
praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon\
used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--They had all\
the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest\
approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to\
consider the subject in the most serviceable light--first, as a settled,\
and, secondly, as a good one--well aware of the nearly equal importance\
of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse\'92s mind.--It was agreed\
upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be\
guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some\
feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some\
time or other--in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very\
bad if the marriage did take place.\
\
Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she\
said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,\
never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she\
saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in\
urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as\
to think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect\
so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one\
respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible,\
so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely\
have attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself\
been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it\
long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma\
would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr.\
Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such\
an arrangement desirable!--The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr.\
Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband\'92s plans and her own, for\
a marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe\
and Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr.\
Weston than by herself--but even he had never been able to finish\
the subject better than by saying--\'93Those matters will take care of\
themselves; the young people will find a way.\'94 But here there was\
nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was\
all right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name.\
It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without\
one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.\
\
Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections\
as these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing could\
increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have\
outgrown its first set of caps.\
\
The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston\
had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to\
familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--He saw the advantages\
of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife;\
but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he\
was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.\
\
\'93It is to be a secret, I conclude,\'94 said he. \'93These matters are always a\
secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be\
told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.\'94\
\
He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that\
point. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest\
daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed,\
of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately\
afterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they\
had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon it\
would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening\
wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.\
\
In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him, and\
others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend their\
all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys;\
and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet,\
upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one\
habitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize was not softened by any\
satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife;\
he only hoped \'93the young lady\'92s pride would now be contented;\'94 and\
supposed \'93she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;\'94 and,\
on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, \'93Rather\
he than I!\'94--But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--\'93Poor\
Knightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him.\'94--She was extremely\
concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good\
qualities.--How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in\
love--not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all\
pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine\
with them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.--Poor\
fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_. Oh!\
no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every\
thing.--Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that\
she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, living\
together. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who\
had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first\
quarter.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XVIII\
\
\
Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would\
be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one\
morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, when\
Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the\
first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began\
with,\
\
\'93I have something to tell you, Emma; some news.\'94\
\
\'93Good or bad?\'94 said she, quickly, looking up in his face.\
\
\'93I do not know which it ought to be called.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance. You are trying not\
to smile.\'94\
\
\'93I am afraid,\'94 said he, composing his features, \'93I am very much afraid,\
my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.\'94\
\
\'93Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases\
or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.\'94\
\
\'93There is one subject,\'94 he replied, \'93I hope but one, on which we do not\
think alike.\'94 He paused a moment, again smiling, with his eyes fixed on\
her face. \'93Does nothing occur to you?--Do not you recollect?--Harriet\
Smith.\'94\
\
Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though\
she knew not what.\
\
\'93Have you heard from her yourself this morning?\'94 cried he. \'93You have, I\
believe, and know the whole.\'94\
\
\'93No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.\'94\
\
\'93You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet\
Smith marries Robert Martin.\'94\
\
Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her eyes,\
in eager gaze, said, \'93No, this is impossible!\'94 but her lips were closed.\
\
\'93It is so, indeed,\'94 continued Mr. Knightley; \'93I have it from Robert\
Martin himself. He left me not half an hour ago.\'94\
\
She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.\
\
\'93You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were\
the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one\
or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not\
talk much on the subject.\'94\
\
\'93You mistake me, you quite mistake me,\'94 she replied, exerting herself.\
\'93It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I\
cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say,\
that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he\
has even proposed to her again--yet. You only mean, that he intends it.\'94\
\
\'93I mean that he has done it,\'94 answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but\
determined decision, \'93and been accepted.\'94\
\
\'93Good God!\'94 she cried.--\'93Well!\'94--Then having recourse to her workbasket,\
in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite\
feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be\
expressing, she added, \'93Well, now tell me every thing; make this\
intelligible to me. How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never was\
more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.--How--how\
has it been possible?\'94\
\
\'93It is a very simple story. He went to town on business three days ago,\
and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send\
to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers, and was\
asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley\'92s. They were\
going to take the two eldest boys to Astley\'92s. The party was to be our\
brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could\
not resist. They called for him in their way; were all extremely amused;\
and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day--which he\
did--and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he found an\
opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak\
in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance, as happy even as he is\
deserving. He came down by yesterday\'92s coach, and was with me this\
morning immediately after breakfast, to report his proceedings, first\
on my affairs, and then on his own. This is all that I can relate of\
the how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much\
longer history when you see her.--She will give you all the minute\
particulars, which only woman\'92s language can make interesting.--In our\
communications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, that\
Robert Martin\'92s heart seemed for _him_, and to _me_, very overflowing;\
and that he did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that\
on quitting their box at Astley\'92s, my brother took charge of Mrs. John\
Knightley and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;\
and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith\
rather uneasy.\'94\
\
He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she\
was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.\
She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad. Her silence disturbed\
him; and after observing her a little while, he added,\
\
\'93Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you\
unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His\
situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies your\
friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him\
as you know him more. His good sense and good principles would delight\
you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend\
in better hands. His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is\
saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William\
Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.\'94\
\
He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not\
to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,\
\
\'93You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think\
Harriet is doing extremely well. _Her_ connexions may be worse than\
_his_. In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they\
are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You\
cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared\
I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined\
against him, much more, than she was before.\'94\
\
\'93You ought to know your friend best,\'94 replied Mr. Knightley; \'93but I\
should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be\
very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.\'94\
\
Emma could not help laughing as she answered, \'93Upon my word, I believe\
you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are you\
perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him.\
I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--Did not you\
misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things; of business,\
shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion of\
so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not Harriet\'92s hand that he was\
certain of--it was the dimensions of some famous ox.\'94\
\
The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert\
Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma\'92s feelings, and so strong\
was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet\'92s\
side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis,\
\'93No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,\'94 that she was\
really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature.\
It could not be otherwise.\
\
\'93Do you dare say this?\'94 cried Mr. Knightley. \'93Do you dare to suppose me\
so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--What do\
you deserve?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with\
any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are\
you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and\
Harriet now are?\'94\
\
\'93I am quite sure,\'94 he replied, speaking very distinctly, \'93that he\
told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity, nothing\
doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you a proof that\
it must be so. He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do. He knew\
of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he could apply for information of\
her relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done,\
than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him that I could not. Then, he\
said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.\'94\
\
\'93I am perfectly satisfied,\'94 replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,\
\'93and most sincerely wish them happy.\'94\
\
\'93You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.\'94\
\
\'93I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.\'94\
\
\'93And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all\
Harriet\'92s good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for\
Robert Martin\'92s sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much\
in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. I have often\
talked to her a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes,\
indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor\
Martin\'92s cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations,\
I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very good\
notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness in\
the affections and utility of domestic life.--Much of this, I have no\
doubt, she may thank you for.\'94\
\
\'93Me!\'94 cried Emma, shaking her head.--\'93Ah! poor Harriet!\'94\
\
She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more\
praise than she deserved.\
\
Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her\
father. She was not sorry. She wanted to be alone. Her mind was in a\
state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her to be\
collected. She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she\
had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she\
could be fit for nothing rational.\
\
Her father\'92s business was to announce James\'92s being gone out to put the\
horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she\
had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.\
\
The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations may be\
imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of\
Harriet\'92s welfare, she was really in danger of becoming too happy for\
security.--What had she to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of\
him, whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own.\
Nothing, but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility\
and circumspection in future.\
\
Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her\
resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the\
very midst of them. She must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the\
doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet!\
\
Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would be a\
pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.\
\
High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the\
reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would\
soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to\
practise, might soon be over. She could now look forward to giving him\
that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to\
welcome as a duty.\
\
In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father; not\
always listening, but always agreeing to what he said; and, whether in\
speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his\
being obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be\
disappointed.\
\
They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly\
had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks\
for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the\
blind, of two figures passing near the window.\
\
\'93It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,\'94 said Mrs. Weston. \'93I was just going to\
tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning. He\
stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the\
day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.\'94\
\
In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to\
see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing\
recollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a\
consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all\
sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that\
Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long\
felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane,\
would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the\
party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a\
want of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for Frank\
Churchill to draw near her and say,\
\
\'93I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message\
in one of Mrs. Weston\'92s letters. I hope time has not made you less\
willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said.\'94\
\
\'93No, indeed,\'94 cried Emma, most happy to begin, \'93not in the least. I am\
particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy\
in person.\'94\
\
He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with\
serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.\
\
\'93Is not she looking well?\'94 said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.\
\'93Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston\
doat upon her.\'94\
\
But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after\
mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named the name of\
Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing.\
\
\'93I can never think of it,\'94 she cried, \'93without extreme shame.\'94\
\
\'93The shame,\'94 he answered, \'93is all mine, or ought to be. But is it\
possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late. Early, I know, you\
had none.\'94\
\
\'93I never had the smallest, I assure you.\'94\
\
\'93That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish I\
had--it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong\
things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no\
service.--It would have been a much better transgression had I broken\
the bond of secrecy and told you every thing.\'94\
\
\'93It is not now worth a regret,\'94 said Emma.\
\
\'93I have some hope,\'94 resumed he, \'93of my uncle\'92s being persuaded to pay a\
visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her. When the Campbells\
are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust,\
till we may carry her northward.--But now, I am at such a distance from\
her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--Till this morning, we have not\
once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?\'94\
\
Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay\
thought, he cried,\
\
\'93Ah! by the bye,\'94 then sinking his voice, and looking demure for the\
moment--\'93I hope Mr. Knightley is well?\'94 He paused.--She coloured and\
laughed.--\'93I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish\
in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.--I assure you that\
I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He is\
a man whom I cannot presume to praise.\'94\
\
Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style; but\
his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane,\
and his next words were,\
\
\'93Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--and\
yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair. It is a\
most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--a most\
distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.--Just colour\
enough for beauty.\'94\
\
\'93I have always admired her complexion,\'94 replied Emma, archly; \'93but\
do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so\
pale?--When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--\'94\
\
But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help\
saying,\
\
\'93I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you\
had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am\
sure it was a consolation to you.\'94\
\
\'93Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most\
miserable wretch!\'94\
\
\'93Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a\
source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us\
all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the\
truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same\
situation. I think there is a little likeness between us.\'94\
\
He bowed.\
\
\'93If not in our dispositions,\'94 she presently added, with a look of true\
sensibility, \'93there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids\
fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.\'94\
\
\'93True, true,\'94 he answered, warmly. \'93No, not true on your side. You can\
have no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel. Look\
at her. Is not she an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her\
throat. Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--You will\
be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously) that my\
uncle means to give her all my aunt\'92s jewels. They are to be new set.\
I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be\
beautiful in her dark hair?\'94\
\
\'93Very beautiful, indeed,\'94 replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that he\
gratefully burst out,\
\
\'93How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent\
looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should\
certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.\'94\
\
The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account\
of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before, from the\
infant\'92s appearing not quite well. She believed she had been foolish,\
but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half a minute of sending\
for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been\
almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the child had\
been perfectly well again. This was her history; and particularly\
interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her very much for\
thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she had not done\
it. \'93She should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the\
slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She could not be\
too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps,\
that he had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,\
very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had\
seen it.\'94\
\
Frank Churchill caught the name.\
\
\'93Perry!\'94 said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss\
Fairfax\'92s eye. \'93My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr.\
Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does he travel now?--Has\
he set up his carriage?\'94\
\
Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined in the\
laugh, it was evident from Jane\'92s countenance that she too was really\
hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.\
\
\'93Such an extraordinary dream of mine!\'94 he cried. \'93I can never think of\
it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see\
it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown. Look at her. Do\
not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her own letter,\
which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--that the whole\
blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to nothing else,\
though pretending to listen to the others?\'94\
\
Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly\
remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious, low, yet\
steady voice,\
\
\'93How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--They\
_will_ sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!\'94\
\
He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but\
Emma\'92s feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving\
Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she\
felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill, and really\
regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never been more\
sensible of Mr. Knightley\'92s high superiority of character. The happiness\
of this most happy day, received its completion, in the animated\
contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.\
\
\
\
CHAPTER XIX\
\
\
If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a\
momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her\
attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from\
unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the\
recurrence of any such uncertainty. A very few days brought the party\
from London, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour\
alone with Harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable\
as it was!--that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,\
and was now forming all her views of happiness.\
\
Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:\
but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and\
self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with\
the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the\
fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend\'92s\
approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by\
meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--Harriet was\
most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley\'92s, and the\
dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.\
But what did such particulars explain?--The fact was, as Emma could now\
acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his\
continuing to love her had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever\
be unintelligible to Emma.\
\
The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh\
reason for thinking so.--Harriet\'92s parentage became known. She proved\
to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the\
comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to\
have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility\
which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely to\
be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what\
a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the\
Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy,\
unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.\
\
No objection was raised on the father\'92s side; the young man was treated\
liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted\
with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she fully\
acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could\
bid fairest for her little friend. She had no doubt of Harriet\'92s\
happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he\
offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and\
improvement. She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her,\
and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety,\
and occupied enough for cheerfulness. She would be never led into\
temptation, nor left for it to find her out. She would be respectable\
and happy; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the\
world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a\
man;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.\
\
Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,\
was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--The\
intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must change\
into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be,\
and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural\
manner.\
\
Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw\
her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as\
no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood before them,\
could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw Mr. Elton,\
but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on\
herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of\
the three, were the first to be married.\
\
Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the\
comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills\
were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.\
\
The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by\
Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought\
to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to\
allow them the fortnight\'92s absence in a tour to the seaside, which was\
the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in\
approving it. But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced\
to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a\
distant event.\
\
When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they were\
almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--He\
began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--a very\
promising step of the mind on its way to resignation. Still, however, he\
was not happy. Nay, he appeared so much otherwise, that his daughter\'92s\
courage failed. She could not bear to see him suffering, to know\
him fancying himself neglected; and though her understanding almost\
acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when\
once the event were over, his distress would be soon over too, she\
hesitated--she could not proceed.\
\
In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden\
illumination of Mr. Woodhouse\'92s mind, or any wonderful change of his\
nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another\
way.--Mrs. Weston\'92s poultry-house was robbed one night of all her\
turkeys--evidently by the ingenuity of man. Other poultry-yards in\
the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr.\
Woodhouse\'92s fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his\
son-in-law\'92s protection, would have been under wretched alarm every\
night of his life. The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the\
Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. While either of them\
protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--But Mr. John Knightley must\
be in London again by the end of the first week in November.\
\
The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,\
cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the\
moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was called\
on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to\
join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.\
\
The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have\
no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars\
detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very\
inferior to her own.--\'93Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a\
most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she heard of it.\'94--But,\
in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence,\
the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the\
ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.\

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\
people in all walks of life.\
\
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'92s\
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\
Literary Archive Foundation\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\
status with the IRS.\
\
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\
particular state visit http://pglaf.org\
\
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\
approach us with offers to donate.\
\
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\
\
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\
works.\
\
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\
\
\
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\
\
\
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\

\
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\
