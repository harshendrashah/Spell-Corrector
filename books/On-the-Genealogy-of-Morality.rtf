\par said: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." _Our_
\par treasure is there, where stand the hives of our knowledge. It is to
\par those hives that we are always striving; as born creatures of flight,
\par and as the honey-gatherers of the spirit, we care really in our hearts
\par only for one thing--to bring something "home to the hive!"
\par 
\par As far as the rest of life with its so-called "experiences" is
\par concerned, which of us has even sufficient serious interest? or
\par sufficient time? In our dealings with such points of life, we are, I
\par fear, never properly to the point; to be precise, our heart is not
\par there, and certainly not our ear. Rather like one who, delighting
\par in a divine distraction, or sunken in the seas of his own soul, in
\par whose ear the clock has just thundered with all its force its twelve
\par strokes of noon, suddenly wakes up, and asks himself, "What has in
\par point of fact just struck?" so do we at times rub afterwards, as it
\par were, our puzzled ears, and ask in complete astonishment and complete
\par embarrassment, "Through what have we in point of fact just lived?"
\par further, "Who are we in point of fact?" and count, _after they have
\par struck_, as I have explained, all the twelve throbbing beats of the
\par clock of our experience, of our life, of our being--ah!--and count
\par wrong in the endeavour. Of necessity we remain strangers to ourselves,
\par we understand ourselves not, in ourselves we are bound to be mistaken,
\par for of us holds good to all eternity the motto, "Each one is the
\par farthest away from himself"--as far as ourselves are concerned we are
\par not "knowers."

\par 
\par My thoughts concerning the _genealogy_ of our moral prejudices--for
\par they constitute the issue in this polemic--have their first, bald,
\par and provisional expression in that collection of aphorisms entitled
\par _Human, all-too-Human, a Book for Free Minds_, the writing of which
\par was begun in Sorrento, during a winter which allowed me to gaze over
\par the broad and dangerous territory through which my mind had up to that
\par time wandered. This took place in the winter of 1876-77; the thoughts
\par themselves are older. They were in their substance already the same
\par thoughts which I take up again in the following treatises:--we hope
\par that they have derived benefit from the long interval, that they have
\par grown riper, clearer, stronger, more complete. The fact, however,
\par that I still cling to them even now, that in the meanwhile they have
\par always held faster by each other, have, in fact, grown out of their
\par original shape and into each other, all this strengthens in my mind the
\par joyous confidence that they must have been originally neither separate
\par disconnected capricious nor sporadic phenomena, but have sprung from
\par a common root, from a fundamental "_fiat_" of knowledge, whose empire
\par reached to the soul's depth, and that ever grew more definite in its
\par voice, and more definite in its demands. That is the only state of
\par affairs that is proper in the case of a philosopher.
\par 
\par We have no right to be "_disconnected_"; we must neither err
\par "disconnectedly" nor strike the truth "disconnectedly." Rather with
\par the necessity with which a tree bears its fruit, so do our thoughts,
\par our values, our Yes's and No's and If's and Whether's, grow connected
\par and interrelated, mutual witnesses of _one_ will, _one_ health, _one_
\par kingdom, _one_ sun--as to whether they are to _your_ taste, these
\par fruits of ours?--But what matters that to the trees? What matters that
\par to us, us the philosophers?
\par

\par 
\par Owing to a scrupulosity peculiar to myself, which I confess
\par reluctantly,--it concerns indeed _morality_,--a scrupulosity, which
\par manifests itself in my life at such an early period, with so much
\par spontaneity, with so chronic a persistence and so keen an opposition
\par to environment, epoch, precedent, and ancestry that I should have
\par been almost entitled to style it my "_\'e2 priori_"--my curiosity and my
\par suspicion felt themselves betimes bound to halt at the question, of
\par what in point of actual fact was the _origin_ of our "Good" and of
\par our "Evil." Indeed, at the boyish age of thirteen the problem of the
\par origin of Evil already haunted me: at an age "when games and God divide
\par one's heart," I devoted to that problem my first childish attempt
\par at the literary game, my first philosophic essay--and as regards my
\par infantile solution of the problem, well, I gave quite properly the
\par honour to God, and made him the _father_ of evil. Did my own "_\'e2
\par priori_" demand that precise solution from me? that new, immoral, or
\par at least "amoral" "_\'e2 priori_" and that "categorical imperative" which
\par was its voice (but oh! how hostile to the Kantian article, and how
\par pregnant with problems!), to which since then I have given more and
\par more attention, and indeed what is more than attention. Fortunately
\par I soon learned to separate theological from moral prejudices, and
\par I gave up looking for a _supernatural_ origin of evil. A certain
\par amount of historical and philological education, to say nothing of
\par an innate faculty of psychological discrimination _par excellence_
\par succeeded in transforming almost immediately my original problem into
\par the following one:--Under what conditions did Man invent for himself
\par those judgments of values, "Good" and "Evil"? _And what intrinsic value
\par do they possess in themselves?_ Have they up to the present hindered
\par or advanced human well-being? Are they a symptom of the distress,
\par impoverishment, and degeneration of Human Life? Or, conversely, is
\par it in them that is manifested the fulness, the strength, and the
\par will of Life, its courage, its self-confidence, its future? On this
\par point I found and hazarded in my mind the most diverse answers, I
\par established distinctions in periods, peoples, and castes, I became a
\par specialist in my problem, and from my answers grew new questions, new
\par investigations, new conjectures, new probabilities; until at last I had
\par a land of my own and a soil of my own, a whole secret world growing and
\par flowering, like hidden gardens of whose existence no one could have an
\par inkling--oh, how happy are we, we finders of knowledge, provided that
\par we know how to keep silent sufficiently long.
\par 
\par 
\par 4.
\par 
\par My first impulse to publish some of my hypotheses concerning the origin
\par of morality I owe to a clear, well-written, and even precocious little
\par book, in which a perverse and vicious kind of moral philosophy (your
\par real English kind) was definitely presented to me for the first time;
\par and this attracted me--with that magnetic attraction, inherent in that
\par which is diametrically opposed and antithetical to one's own ideas.
\par The title of the book was _The Origin of the Moral Emotions_; its
\par author, Dr. Paul R\'e9e; the year of its appearance, 1877. I may almost
\par say that I have never read anything in which every single dogma and
\par conclusion has called forth from me so emphatic a negation as did that
\par book; albeit a negation tainted by either pique or intolerance. I
\par referred accordingly both in season and out of season in the previous
\par works, at which I was then working, to the arguments of that book, not
\par to refute them--for what have I got to do with mere refutations but
\par substituting, as is natural to a positive mind, for an improbable
\par theory one which is more probable, and occasionally no doubt, for one
\par philosophic error, another. In that early period I gave, as I have
\par said, the first public expression to those theories of origin to which
\par these essays are devoted, but with a clumsiness which I was the last
\par to conceal from myself, for I was as yet cramped, being still without
\par a special language for these special subjects, still frequently liable
\par to relapse and to vacillation. To go into details, compare what I say
\par in _Human, all-too-Human_, part i., about the parallel early history
\par of Good and Evil, Aph. 45 (namely, their origin from the castes of the
\par aristocrats and the slaves); similarly, Aph. 136 et seq., concerning
\par the birth and value of ascetic morality; similarly, Aphs. 96, 99,
\par vol. ii., Aph. 89, concerning the Morality of Custom, that far older
\par and more original kind of morality which is _toto c\'9clo_ different
\par from the altruistic ethics (in which Dr. R\'e9e, like all the English
\par moral philosophers, sees the ethical "Thing-in-itself"); finally,
\par Aph. 92. Similarly, Aph. 26 in _Human, all-too-Human_, part ii., and
\par Aph. 112, the _Dawn of Day_, concerning the origin of Justice as a
\par balance between persons of approximately equal power (equilibrium as
\par the hypothesis of all contract, consequently of all law); similarly,
\par concerning the origin of Punishment, _Human, all-too-Human_, part
\par ii., Aphs. 22, 23, in regard to which the deterrent object is neither
\par essential nor original (as Dr. R\'e9e thinks:--rather is it that this
\par object is only imported, under certain definite conditions, and always
\par as something extra and additional).
\par 
\par 
\par 5.
\par 
\par In reality I had set my heart at that time on something much more
\par important than the nature of the theories of myself or others
\par concerning the origin of morality (or, more precisely, the real
\par function from my view of these theories was to point an end to which
\par they were one among many means). The issue for me was the value
\par of morality, and on that subject I had to place myself in a state
\par of abstraction, in which I was almost alone with my great teacher
\par Schopenhauer, to whom that book, with all its passion and inherent
\par contradiction (for that book also was a polemic), turned for present
\par help as though he were still alive. The issue was, strangely enough,
\par the value of the "un-egoistic" instincts, the instincts of pity,
\par self-denial, and self-sacrifice which Schopenhauer had so persistently
\par painted in golden colours, deified and etherealised, that eventually
\par they appeared to him, as it were, high and dry, as "intrinsic values
\par in themselves," on the strength of which he uttered both to Life
\par and to himself his own negation. But against _these very_ instincts
\par there voiced itself in my soul a more and more fundamental mistrust, a
\par scepticism that dug ever deeper and deeper: and in this very instinct
\par I saw the _great_ danger of mankind, its most sublime temptation and
\par seduction--seduction to what? to nothingness?--in these very instincts
\par I saw the beginning of the end, stability, the exhaustion that gazes
\par backwards, the will turning _against_ Life, the last illness announcing
\par itself with its own mincing melancholy: I realised that the morality
\par of pity which spread wider and wider, and whose grip infected even
\par philosophers with its disease, was the most sinister symptom of our
\par modern European civilisation; I realised that it was the route along
\par which that civilisation slid on its way to--a new Buddhism?--a European
\par Buddhism?--_Nihilism_? This exaggerated estimation in which modern
\par philosophers have held pity, is quite a new phenomenon: up to that time
\par philosophers were absolutely unanimous as to the worthlessness of pity.
\par I need only mention Plato, Spinoza, La Rochefoucauld, and Kant--four
\par minds as mutually different as is possible, but united on one point;
\par their contempt of pity.
\par 
\par 
\par 6.
\par 
\par This problem of the value of pity and of the pity-morality (I am an
\par opponent of the modern infamous emasculation of our emotions) seems at
\par the first blush a mere isolated problem, a note of interrogation for
\par itself; he, however, who once halts at this problem, and learns how to
\par put questions, will experience what I experienced:--a new and immense
\par vista unfolds itself before him, a sense of potentiality seizes him
\par like a vertigo, every species of doubt, mistrust, and fear springs
\par up, the belief in morality, nay, in all morality, totters,--finally a
\par new demand voices itself. Let us speak out this _new demand_: we need
\par a _critique_ of moral values, _the value of these values_ is for the
\par first time to be called into question--and for this purpose a knowledge
\par is necessary of the conditions and circumstances out of which these
\par values grew, and under which they experienced their evolution and
\par their distortion (morality as a result, as a symptom, as a mask, as
\par Tartuffism, as disease, as a misunderstanding; but also morality as a
\par cause, as a remedy, as a stimulant, as a fetter, as a drug), especially
\par as such a knowledge has neither existed up to the present time nor is
\par even now generally desired. The value of these "values" was taken for
\par granted as an indisputable fact, which was beyond all question. No one
\par has, up to the present, exhibited the faintest doubt or hesitation in
\par judging the "good man" to be of a higher value than the "evil man," of
\par a higher value with regard specifically to human progress, utility,
\par and prosperity generally, not forgetting the future. What? Suppose the
\par converse were the truth! What? Suppose there lurked in the "good man"
\par a symptom of retrogression, such as a danger, a temptation, a poison,
\par a _narcotic_, by means of which the present _battened on the future_!
\par More comfortable and less risky perhaps than its opposite, but also
\par pettier, meaner! So that morality would really be saddled with the
\par guilt, if the _maximum potentiality of the power and splendour_ of the
\par human species were never to be attained? So that really morality would
\par be the danger of dangers?
\par 
\par 
\par 7.
\par 
\par Enough, that after this vista had disclosed itself to me, I myself had
\par reason to search for learned, bold, and industrious colleagues (I am
\par doing it even to this very day). It means traversing with new clamorous
\par questions, and at the same time with new eyes, the immense, distant,
\par and completely unexplored land of morality--of a morality which has
\par actually existed and been actually lived! and is this not practically
\par equivalent to first _discovering_ that land? If, in this context, I
\par thought, amongst others, of the aforesaid Dr. R\'e9e, I did so because I
\par had no doubt that from the very nature of his questions he would be
\par compelled to have recourse to a truer method, in order to obtain his
\par answers. Have I deceived myself on that score? I wished at all events
\par to give a better direction of vision to an eye of such keenness, and
\par such impartiality. I wished to direct him to the real _history of
\par morality_, and to warn him, while there was yet time, against a world
\par of English theories that culminated in _the blue vacuum of heaven_.
\par Other colours, of course, rise immediately to one's mind as being a
\par hundred times more potent than blue for a genealogy of morals:--for
\par instance, grey, by which I mean authentic facts capable of definite
\par proof and having actually existed, or, to put it shortly, the whole
\par of that long hieroglyphic script (which is so hard to decipher) about
\par the past history of human morals. This script was unknown to Dr. R\'e9e;
\par but he had read Darwin:--and so in his philosophy the Darwinian beast
\par and that pink of modernity, the demure weakling and dilettante, who
\par "bites no longer," shake hands politely in a fashion that is at least
\par instructive, the latter exhibiting a certain facial expression of
\par refined and good-humoured indolence, tinged with a touch of pessimism
\par and exhaustion; as if it really did not pay to take all these things--I
\par mean moral problems--so seriously. I, on the other hand, think that
\par there are no subjects which pay better for being taken seriously; part
\par of this payment is, that perhaps eventually they admit of being taken
\par gaily. This gaiety indeed, or, to use my own language, this joyful
\par wisdom, is a payment; a payment for a protracted, brave, laborious, and
\par burrowing seriousness, which, it goes without saying, is the attribute
\par of but a few. But on that day on which we say from the fullness of our
\par hearts, "Forward! our old morality too is fit material for Comedy,"
\par we shall have discovered a new plot, and a new possibility for the
\par Dionysian drama entitled The Soul's Fate--and he will speedily utilise
\par it, one can wager safely, he, the great ancient eternal dramatist of
\par the comedy of our existence.

\par 
\par If this writing be obscure to any individual, and jar on his ears, I
\par do not think that it is necessarily I who am to blame. It is clear
\par enough, on the hypothesis which I presuppose, namely, that the reader
\par has first read my previous writings and has not grudged them a certain
\par amount of trouble: it is not, indeed, a simple matter to get really at
\par their essence. Take, for instance, my _Zarathustra_; I allow no one
\par to pass muster as knowing that book, unless every single word therein
\par has at some time wrought in him a profound wound, and at some time
\par exercised on him a profound enchantment: then and not till then can he
\par enjoy the privilege of participating reverently in the halcyon element,
\par from which that work is born, in its sunny brilliance, its distance,
\par its spaciousness, its certainty. In other cases the aphoristic form
\par produces difficulty, but this is only because this form is treated
\par _too casually_. An aphorism properly coined and cast into its final
\par mould is far from being "deciphered" as soon as it has been read; on
\par the contrary, it is then that it first requires _to be expounded_--of
\par course for that purpose an art of exposition is necessary. The third
\par essay in this book provides an example of what is offered, of what in
\par such cases I call exposition: an aphorism is prefixed to that essay,
\par the essay itself is its commentary. Certainly one _quality_ which
\par nowadays has been best forgotten--and that is why it will take some
\par time yet for my writings to become readable--is essential in order
\par to practise reading as an art--a quality for the exercise of which it
\par is necessary to be a cow, and under no circumstances a modern man!--
\par rumination.

\par FIRST ESSAY. "GOOD AND EVIL," "GOOD AND BAD."
\par 
\par 
\par 1.
\par 
\par Those English psychologists, who up to the present are the only
\par philosophers who are to be thanked for any endeavour to get as far
\par as a history of the origin of morality--these men, I say, offer us
\par in their own personalities no paltry problem;--they even have, if I
\par am to be quite frank about it, in their capacity of living riddles,
\par an advantage over their books--_they themselves are interesting!_
\par These English psychologists--what do they really mean? We always
\par find them voluntarily or involuntarily at the same task of pushing
\par to the front the _partie honteuse_ of our inner world, and looking
\par for the efficient, governing, and decisive principle in that precise
\par quarter where the intellectual self-respect of the race would be
\par the most reluctant to find it (for example, in the _vis inerti\'e6_ of
\par habit, or in forgetfulness, or in a blind and fortuitous mechanism
\par and association of ideas, or in some factor that is purely passive,
\par reflex, molecular, or fundamentally stupid)--what is the real motive
\par power which always impels these psychologists in precisely _this_
\par direction? Is it an instinct for human disparagement somewhat sinister,
\par vulgar, and malignant, or perhaps incomprehensible even to itself? or
\par perhaps a touch of pessimistic jealousy, the mistrust of disillusioned
\par idealists who have become gloomy, poisoned, and bitter? or a petty
\par subconscious enmity and rancour against Christianity (and Plato), that
\par has conceivably never crossed the threshold of consciousness? or just a
\par vicious taste for those elements of life which are bizarre, painfully
\par paradoxical, mystical, and illogical? or, as a final alternative, a
\par dash of each of these motives--a little vulgarity, a little gloominess,
\par a little anti-Christianity, a little craving for the necessary piquancy?
\par 
\par But I am told that it is simply a case of old frigid and tedious frogs
\par crawling and hopping around men and inside men, as if they were as
\par thoroughly at home there, as they would be in a _swamp_.
\par 
\par I am opposed to this statement, nay, I do not believe it; and if, in
\par the impossibility of knowledge, one is permitted to wish, so do I wish
\par from my heart that just the converse metaphor should apply, and that
\par these analysts with their psychological microscopes should be, at
\par bottom, brave, proud, and magnanimous animals who know how to bridle
\par both their hearts and their smarts, and have specifically trained
\par themselves to sacrifice what is desirable to what is true, any truth
\par in fact, even the simple, bitter, ugly, repulsive, unchristian, and
\par immoral truths--for there are truths of that description.
\par 
\par 
\par 2.
\par 
\par All honour, then, to the noble spirits who would fain dominate these
\par historians of morality. But it is certainly a pity that they lack the
\par _historical sense_ itself, that they themselves are quite deserted
\par by all the beneficent spirits of history. The whole train of their
\par thought runs, as was always the way of old-fashioned philosophers, on
\par thoroughly unhistorical lines: there is no doubt on this point. The
\par crass ineptitude of their genealogy of morals is immediately apparent
\par when the question arises of ascertaining the origin of the idea and
\par judgment of "good." "Man had originally," so speaks their decree,
\par "praised and called 'good' altruistic acts from the standpoint of
\par those on whom they were conferred, that is, those to whom they were
\par _useful_; subsequently the origin of this praise was _forgotten_, and
\par altruistic acts, simply because, as a sheer matter of habit, they were
\par praised as good, came also to be felt as good--as though they contained
\par in themselves some intrinsic goodness." The thing is obvious:--this
\par initial derivation contains already all the typical and idiosyncratic
\par traits of the English psychologists--we have "utility," "forgetting,"
\par "habit," and finally "error," the whole assemblage forming the basis
\par of a system of values, on which the higher man has up to the present
\par prided himself as though it were a kind of privilege of man in general.
\par This pride _must_ be brought low, this system of values _must_ lose its
\par values: is that attained?
\par 
\par Now the first argument that comes ready to my hand is that the real
\par homestead of the concept "good" is sought and located in the wrong
\par place: the judgment "good" did not originate among those to whom
\par goodness was shown. Much rather has it been the good themselves,
\par that is, the aristocratic, the powerful, the high-stationed, the
\par high-minded, who have felt that they themselves were good, and that
\par their actions were good, that is to say of the first order, in
\par contradistinction to all the low, the low-minded, the vulgar, and
\par the plebeian. It was out of this pathos of distance that they first
\par arrogated the right to create values for their own profit, and to
\par coin the names of such values: what had they to do with utility? The
\par standpoint of utility is as alien and as inapplicable as it could
\par possibly be, when we have to deal with so volcanic an effervescence of
\par supreme values, creating and demarcating as they do a hierarchy within
\par themselves: it is at this juncture that one arrives at an appreciation
\par of the contrast to that tepid temperature, which is the presupposition
\par on which every combination of worldly wisdom and every calculation of
\par practical expediency is always based--and not for one occasional, not
\par for one exceptional instance, but chronically. The pathos of nobility
\par and distance, as I have said, the chronic and despotic _esprit de
\par corps_ and fundamental instinct of a higher dominant race coming into
\par association with a meaner race, an "under race," this is the origin of
\par the antithesis of good and bad.
\par 
\par (The masters' right of giving names goes so far that it is permissible
\par to look upon language itself as the expression of the power of the
\par masters: they say "this _is_ that, and that," they seal finally every
\par object and every event with a sound, and thereby at the same time take
\par possession of it.) It is because of this origin that the word "good"
\par is far from having any necessary connection with altruistic acts, in
\par accordance with the superstitious belief of these moral philosophers.
\par On the contrary, it is on the occasion of the _decay_ of aristocratic
\par values, that the antitheses between "egoistic" and "altruistic"
\par presses more and more heavily on the human conscience--it is, to use
\par my own language, the _herd instinct_ which finds in this antithesis an
\par expression in many ways. And even then it takes a considerable time
\par for this instinct to become sufficiently dominant, for the valuation
\par to be inextricably dependent on this antithesis (as is the case in
\par contemporary Europe); for to-day that prejudice is predominant, which,
\par acting even now with all the intensity of an obsession and brain
\par disease, holds that "moral," "altruistic," and "_d\'e9sint\'e9ress\'e9_" are
\par concepts of equal value.
\par 
\par 
\par 3.
\par 
\par In the second place, quite apart from the fact that this hypothesis as
\par to the genesis of the value "good" cannot be historically upheld, it
\par suffers from an inherent psychological contradiction. The utility of
\par altruistic conduct has presumably been the origin of its being praised,
\par and this origin has become _forgotten_:--But in what conceivable way is
\par this forgetting _possible_! Has perchance the utility of such conduct
\par ceased at some given moment? The contrary is the case. This utility has
\par rather been experienced every day at all times, and is consequently
\par a feature that obtains a new and regular emphasis with every fresh
\par day; it follows that, so far from vanishing from the consciousness, so
\par far indeed from being forgotten, it must necessarily become impressed
\par on the consciousness with ever-increasing distinctness. How much
\par more logical is that contrary theory (it is not the truer for that)
\par which is represented, for instance, by Herbert Spencer, who places
\par the concept "good" as essentially similar to the concept "useful,"
\par "purposive," so that in the judgments "good" and "bad" mankind is
\par simply summarising and investing with a sanction its _unforgotten_ and
\par _unforgettable_ experiences concerning the "useful-purposive" and the
\par "mischievous-non-purposive." According to this theory, "good" is the
\par attribute of that which has previously shown itself useful; and so
\par is able to claim to be considered "valuable in the highest degree,"
\par "valuable in itself." This method of explanation is also, as I have
\par said, wrong, but at any rate the explanation itself is coherent, and
\par psychologically tenable.
\par 
\par 
\par 4.
\par 
\par The guide-post which first put me on the right track was this
\par question--what is the true etymological significance of the various
\par symbols for the idea "good" which have been coined in the various
\par languages? I then found that they all led back to _the same evolution
\par of the same idea_--that everywhere "aristocrat," "noble" (in the
\par social sense), is the root idea, out of which have necessarily
\par developed "good" in the sense of "with aristocratic soul," "noble,"
\par in the sense of "with a soul of high calibre," "with a privileged
\par soul"--a development which invariably runs parallel with that other
\par evolution by which "vulgar," "plebeian," "low," are made to change
\par finally into "bad." The most eloquent proof of this last contention
\par is the German word "_schlecht_" itself: this word is identical with
\par "_schlicht_"--(compare "_schlechtweg_" and "_schlechterdings_")--which,
\par originally and as yet without any sinister innuendo, simply denoted
\par the plebeian man in contrast to the aristocratic man. It is at the
\par sufficiently late period of the Thirty Years' War that this sense
\par becomes changed to the sense now current. From the standpoint of
\par the Genealogy of Morals this discovery seems to be substantial: the
\par lateness of it is to be attributed to the retarding influence exercised
\par in the modern world by democratic prejudice in the sphere of all
\par questions of origin. This extends, as will shortly be shown, even to
\par the province of natural science and physiology, which, _prima facie_
\par is the most objective. The extent of the mischief which is caused by
\par this prejudice (once it is free of all trammels except those of its own
\par malice), particularly to Ethics and History, is shown by the notorious
\par case of Buckle: it was in Buckle that that _plebeianism_ of the modern
\par spirit, which is of English origin, broke out once again from its
\par malignant soil with all the violence of a slimy volcano, and with that
\par salted, rampant, and vulgar eloquence with which up to the present time
\par all volcanoes have spoken.

\par 
\par With regard to our problem, which can justly be called an intimate
\par problem, and which elects to appeal to only a limited number of ears:
\par it is of no small interest to ascertain that in those words and roots
\par which denote "good" we catch glimpses of that arch-trait, on the
\par strength of which the aristocrats feel themselves to be beings of
\par a higher order than their fellows. Indeed, they call themselves in
\par perhaps the most frequent instances simply after their superiority
\par in power (_e.g._ "the powerful," "the lords," "the commanders"), or
\par after the most obvious sign of their superiority, as for example
\par "the rich," "the possessors" (that is the meaning of _arya_; and the
\par Iranian and Slav languages correspond). But they also call themselves
\par after some _characteristic idiosyncrasy_; and this is the case which
\par now concerns us. They name themselves, for instance, "the truthful":
\par this is first done by the Greek nobility whose mouthpiece is found in
\par Theognis, the Megarian poet. The word }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u7952\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'f3\'e8\'eb\'ef\'f2, which is coined for the
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 purpose, signifies etymologically "one who _is_," who has reality, who
\par is real, who is true; and then with a subjective twist, the "true,"
\par as the "truthful": at this stage in the evolution of the idea, it
\par becomes the motto and party cry of the nobility, and quite completes
\par the transition to the meaning "noble," so as to place outside the pale
\par the lying, vulgar man, as Theognis conceives and portrays him--till
\par finally the word after the decay of the nobility is left to delineate
\par psychological _noblesse_, and becomes as it were ripe and mellow. In
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 the word \'ea\'e1\'ea\'fc\'f2 as in \'e4\'e5\'e9\'eb\'fc\'f2 (the plebeian in contrast to the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u7936\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'e3\'e1\'e8\'fc\'f2)
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 the cowardice is emphasised. This affords perhaps an inkling on what
\par lines the etymological origin of the very ambiguous }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u7936\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'e3\'e1\'e8\'fc\'f2 is to be
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 investigated. In the Latin _malus_ (which I place side by side with
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'ec\'dd\'eb\'e1\'f2) the vulgar man can be distinguished as the dark-coloured, and
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 above all as the black-haired ("_hic niger est_"), as the pre-Aryan
\par inhabitants of the Italian soil, whose complexion formed the clearest
\par feature of distinction from the dominant blondes, namely, the Aryan
\par conquering race:--at any rate Gaelic has afforded me the exact
\par analogue--_Fin_ (for instance, in the name Fin-Gal), the distinctive
\par word of the nobility, finally--good, noble, clean, but originally the
\par blonde-haired man in contrast to the dark black-haired aboriginals. The
\par Celts, if I may make a parenthetic statement, were throughout a blonde
\par race; and it is wrong to connect, as Virchow still connects, those
\par traces of an essentially dark-haired population which are to be seen
\par on the more elaborate ethnographical maps of Germany with any Celtic
\par ancestry or with any admixture of Celtic blood: in this context it is
\par rather the _pre-Aryan_ population of Germany which surges up to these
\par districts. (The same is true substantially of the whole of Europe: in
\par point of fact, the subject race has finally again obtained the upper
\par hand, in complexion and the shortness of the skull, and perhaps in
\par the intellectual and social qualities. Who can guarantee that modern
\par democracy, still more modern anarchy, and indeed that tendency to the
\par "Commune," the most primitive form of society, which is now common to
\par all the Socialists in Europe, does not in its real essence signify a
\par monstrous reversion--and that the conquering and _master_ race--the
\par Aryan race, is not also becoming inferior physiologically?) I believe
\par that I can explain the Latin _bonus_ as the "warrior": my hypothesis
\par is that I am right in deriving _bonus_ from an older _duonus_ (compare
\par _bellum_ = _duellum_ = _duen-lum_, in which the word _duonus_ appears
\par to me to be contained). Bonus accordingly as the man of discord, of
\par variance, "entzweiung" (_duo_), as the warrior: one sees what in
\par ancient Rome "the good" meant for a man. Must not our actual German
\par word _gut_ mean "_the godlike_, the man of godlike race"? and be
\par identical with the national name (originally the nobles' name) of the
\par _Goths_?
\par 
\par The grounds for this supposition do not appertain to this work.
\par 
\par 
\par 6.
\par 
\par Above all, there is no exception (though there are opportunities for
\par exceptions) to this rule, that the idea of political superiority
\par always resolves itself into the idea of psychological superiority, in
\par those cases where the highest caste is at the same time the _priestly_
\par caste, and in accordance with its general characteristics confers on
\par itself the privilege of a title which alludes specifically to its
\par priestly function. It is in these cases, for instance, that "clean" and
\par "unclean" confront each other for the first time as badges of class
\par distinction; here again there develops a "good" and a "bad," in a sense
\par which has ceased to be merely social. Moreover, care should be taken
\par not to take these ideas of "clean" and "unclean" too seriously, too
\par broadly, or too symbolically: all the ideas of ancient man have, on
\par the contrary, got to be understood in their initial stages, in a sense
\par which is, to an almost inconceivable extent, crude, coarse, physical,
\par and narrow, and above all essentially unsymbolical. The "clean man" is
\par originally only a man who washes himself, who abstains from certain
\par foods which are conducive to skin diseases, who does not sleep with
\par the unclean women of the lower classes, who has a horror of blood--not
\par more, not much more! On the other hand, the very nature of a priestly
\par aristocracy shows the reasons why just at such an early juncture
\par there should ensue a really dangerous sharpening and intensification
\par of opposed values: it is, in fact, through these opposed values that
\par gulfs are cleft in the social plane, which a veritable Achilles of
\par free thought would shudder to cross. There is from the outset a
\par certain _diseased taint_ in such sacerdotal aristocracies, and in the
\par habits which prevail in such societies--habits which, _averse_ as they
\par are to action, constitute a compound of introspection and explosive
\par emotionalism, as a result of which there appears that introspective
\par morbidity and neurasthenia, which adheres almost inevitably to all
\par priests at all times: with regard, however, to the remedy which they
\par themselves have invented for this disease--the philosopher has no
\par option but to state, that it has proved itself in its effects a hundred
\par times more dangerous than the disease, from which it should have been
\par the deliverer. Humanity itself is still diseased from the effects of
\par the na\'efvet\'e9s of this priestly cure. Take, for instance, certain kinds
\par of diet (abstention from flesh), fasts, sexual continence, flight
\par into the wilderness (a kind of Weir-Mitchell isolation, though of
\par course without that system of excessive feeding and fattening which
\par is the most efficient antidote to all the hysteria of the ascetic
\par ideal); consider too the whole metaphysic of the priests, with its
\par war on the senses, its enervation, its hair-splitting; consider its
\par self-hypnotism on the fakir and Brahman principles (it uses Brahman as
\par a glass disc and obsession), and that climax which we can understand
\par only too well of an unusual satiety with its panacea of _nothingness_
\par (or God:--the demand for a _unio mystica_ with God is the demand of the
\par Buddhist for nothingness, Nirvana--and nothing else!). In sacerdotal
\par societies _every_ element is on a more dangerous scale, not merely
\par cures and remedies, but also pride, revenge, cunning, exaltation, love,
\par ambition, virtue, morbidity:--further, it can fairly be stated that it
\par is on the soil of this _essentially dangerous_ form of human society,
\par the sacerdotal form, that man really becomes for the first time an
\par _interesting animal_, that it is in this form that the soul of man has
\par in a higher sense attained _depths_ and become _evil_--and those are
\par the two fundamental forms of the superiority which up to the present
\par man has exhibited over every other animal.
\par 
\par 
\par 7.
\par 
\par The reader will have already surmised with what ease the priestly mode
\par of valuation can branch off from the knightly aristocratic mode, and
\par then develop into the very antithesis of the latter: special impetus
\par is given to this opposition, by every occasion when the castes of the
\par priests and warriors confront each other with mutual jealousy and
\par cannot agree over the prize. The knightly-aristocratic "values" are
\par based on a careful cult of the physical, on a flowering, rich, and
\par even effervescing healthiness, that goes considerably beyond what
\par is necessary for maintaining life, on war, adventure, the chase,
\par the dance, the tourney--on everything, in fact, which is contained
\par in strong, free, and joyous action. The priestly-aristocratic mode
\par of valuation is--we have seen--based on other hypotheses: it is bad
\par enough for this class when it is a question of war! Yet the priests
\par are, as is notorious, _the worst enemies_--why? Because they are the
\par weakest. Their weakness causes their hate to expand into a monstrous
\par and sinister shape, a shape which is most crafty and most poisonous.
\par The really great haters in the history of the world have always been
\par priests, who are also the cleverest haters--in comparison with the
\par cleverness of priestly revenge, every other piece of cleverness is
\par practically negligible. Human history would be too fatuous for anything
\par were it not for the cleverness imported into it by the weak--take at
\par once the most important instance. All the world's efforts against the
\par "aristocrats," the "mighty," the "masters," the "holders of power,"
\par are negligible by comparison with what has been accomplished against
\par those classes by _the Jews_--the Jews, that priestly nation which
\par eventually realised that the one method of effecting satisfaction on
\par its enemies and tyrants was by means of a radical transvaluation of
\par values, which was at the same time an act of the _cleverest revenge_.
\par Yet the method was only appropriate to a nation of priests, to a nation
\par of the most jealously nursed priestly revengefulness. It was the Jews
\par who, in opposition to the aristocratic equation (good = aristocratic
\par = beautiful = happy = loved by the gods), dared with a terrifying
\par logic to suggest the contrary equation, and indeed to maintain with
\par the teeth of the most profound hatred (the hatred of weakness) this
\par contrary equation, namely, "the wretched are alone the good; the poor,
\par the weak, the lowly, are alone the good; the suffering, the needy, the
\par sick, the loathsome, are the only ones who are pious, the only ones
\par who are blessed, for them alone is salvation--but you, on the other
\par hand, you aristocrats, you men of power, you are to all eternity the
\par evil, the horrible, the covetous, the insatiate, the godless; eternally
\par also shall you be the unblessed, the cursed, the damned!" We know who
\par it was who reaped the heritage of this Jewish transvaluation. In the
\par context of the monstrous and inordinately fateful initiative which
\par the Jews have exhibited in connection with this most fundamental of
\par all declarations of war, I remember the passage which came to my pen
\par on another occasion (_Beyond Good and Evil_, Aph. 195)--that it was,
\par in fact, with the Jews that the _revolt of the slaves_ begins in the
\par sphere _of morals_; that revolt which has behind it a history of two
\par millennia, and which at the present day has only moved out of our
\par sight, because it--has achieved victory.
\par 
\par 
\par 8.
\par 
\par But you understand this not? You have no eyes for a force which
\par has taken two thousand years to achieve victory?--There is nothing
\par wonderful in this: all _lengthy_ processes are hard to see and to
\par realise. But _this_ is what took place: from the trunk of that tree
\par of revenge and hate, Jewish hate,--that most profound and sublime
\par hate, which creates ideals and changes old values to new creations,
\par the like of which has never been on earth,--there grew a phenomenon
\par which was equally incomparable, _a new love_, the most profound and
\par sublime of all kinds of love;--and from what other trunk could it have
\par grown? But beware of supposing that this love has soared on its upward
\par growth, as in any way a real negation of that thirst for revenge, as
\par an antithesis to the Jewish hate! No, the contrary is the truth! This
\par love grew out of that hate, as its crown, as its triumphant crown,
\par circling wider and wider amid the clarity and fulness of the sun, and
\par pursuing in the very kingdom of light and height its goal of hatred,
\par its victory, its spoil, its strategy, with the same intensity with
\par which the roots of that tree of hate sank into everything which was
\par deep and evil with increasing stability and increasing desire. This
\par Jesus of Nazareth, the incarnate gospel of love, this "Redeemer"
\par bringing salvation and victory to the poor, the sick, the sinful--was
\par he not really temptation in its most sinister and irresistible form,
\par temptation to take the tortuous path to those very _Jewish_ values and
\par those very Jewish ideals? Has not Israel really obtained the final goal
\par of its sublime revenge, by the tortuous paths of this "Redeemer," for
\par all that he might pose as Israel's adversary and Israel's destroyer? Is
\par it not due to the black magic of a really _great_ policy of revenge,
\par of a far-seeing, burrowing revenge, both acting and calculating with
\par slowness, that Israel himself must repudiate before all the world the
\par actual instrument of his own revenge and nail it to the cross, so
\par that all the world--that is, all the enemies of Israel--could nibble
\par without suspicion at this very bait? Could, moreover, any human mind
\par with all its elaborate ingenuity invent a bait that was more truly
\par _dangerous_? Anything that was even equivalent in the power of its
\par seductive, intoxicating, defiling, and corrupting influence to that
\par symbol of the holy cross, to that awful paradox of a "god on the
\par cross," to that mystery of the unthinkable, supreme, and utter horror
\par of the self-crucifixion of a god for the _salvation of man_? It is
\par at least certain that _sub hoc signo_ Israel, with its revenge and
\par transvaluation of all values, has up to the present always triumphed
\par again over all other ideals, over all more aristocratic ideals.
\par 
\par 
\par 9.
\par 
\par "But why do you talk of nobler ideals? Let us submit to the facts;
\par that the people have triumphed--or the slaves, or the populace, or the
\par herd, or whatever name you care to give them--if this has happened
\par through the Jews, so be it! In that case no nation ever had a greater
\par mission in the world's history. The 'masters' have been done away
\par with; the morality of the vulgar man has triumphed. This triumph may
\par also be called a blood-poisoning (it has mutually fused the races)--I
\par do not dispute it; but there is no doubt but that this intoxication
\par has succeeded. The 'redemption' of the human race (that is, from the
\par masters) is progressing swimmingly; everything is obviously becoming
\par Judaised, or Christianised, or vulgarised (what is there in the
\par words?). It seems impossible to stop the course of this poisoning
\par through the whole body politic of mankind--but its _tempo_ and pace
\par may from the present time be slower, more delicate, quieter, more
\par discreet--there is time enough. In view of this context has the Church
\par nowadays any necessary purpose? has it, in fact, a right to live? Or
\par could man get on without it? _Qu\'e6ritur_. It seems that it fetters and
\par retards this tendency, instead of accelerating it. Well, even that
\par might be its utility. The Church certainly is a crude and boorish
\par institution, that is repugnant to an intelligence with any pretence at
\par delicacy, to a really modern taste. Should it not at any rate learn to
\par be somewhat more subtle? It alienates nowadays, more than it allures.
\par Which of us would, forsooth, be a freethinker if there were no Church?
\par It is the Church which repels us, not its poison--apart from the Church
\par we like the poison." This is the epilogue of a freethinker to my
\par discourse, of an honourable animal (as he has given abundant proof),
\par and a democrat to boot; he had up to that time listened to me, and
\par could not endure my silence, but for me, indeed, with regard to this
\par topic there is much on which to be silent.
\par 
\par 
\par 10.
\par 
\par The revolt of the slaves in morals begins in the very principle of
\par _resentment_ becoming creative and giving birth to values--a resentment
\par experienced by creatures who, deprived as they are of the proper outlet
\par of action, are forced to find their compensation in an imaginary
\par revenge. While every aristocratic morality springs from a triumphant
\par affirmation of its own demands, the slave morality says "no" from the
\par very outset to what is "outside itself," "different from itself," and
\par "not itself": and this "no" is its creative deed. This volte-face of
\par the valuing standpoint--this _inevitable_ gravitation to the objective
\par instead of back to the subjective--is typical of "resentment": the
\par slave-morality requires as the condition of its existence an external
\par and objective world, to employ physiological terminology, it requires
\par objective stimuli to be capable of action at all--its action is
\par fundamentally a reaction. The contrary is the case when we come to
\par the aristocrat's system of values: it acts and grows spontaneously,
\par it merely seeks its antithesis in order to pronounce a more grateful
\par and exultant "yes" to its own self;--its negative conception, "low,"
\par "vulgar," "bad," is merely a pale late-born foil in comparison with its
\par positive and fundamental conception (saturated as it is with life and
\par passion), of "we aristocrats, we good ones, we beautiful ones, we happy
\par ones."
\par 
\par When the aristocratic morality goes astray and commits sacrilege on
\par reality, this is limited to that particular sphere with which it
\par is _not_ sufficiently acquainted--a sphere, in fact, from the real
\par knowledge of which it disdainfully defends itself. It misjudges, in
\par some cases, the sphere which it despises, the sphere of the common
\par vulgar man and the low people: on the other hand, due weight should be
\par given to the consideration that in any case the mood of contempt, of
\par disdain, of superciliousness, even on the supposition that it _falsely_
\par portrays the object of its contempt, will always be far removed from
\par that degree of falsity which will always characterise the attacks--in
\par effigy, of course--of the vindictive hatred and revengefulness of
\par the weak in onslaughts on their enemies. In point of fact, there is
\par in contempt too strong an admixture of nonchalance, of casualness,
\par of boredom, of impatience, even of personal exultation, for it to be
\par capable of distorting its victim into a real caricature or a real
\par monstrosity. Attention again should be paid to the almost benevolent
\par _nuances_ which, for instance, the Greek nobility imports into all
\par the words by which it distinguishes the common people from itself;
\par note how continuously a kind of pity, care, and consideration imparts
\par its honeyed _flavour_, until at last almost all the words which are
\par applied to the vulgar man survive finally as expressions for "unhappy,"
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 "worthy of pity" (compare \'e4\'e5\'e9\'eb\'ef, \'e4\'e5\'df\'eb\'e1\'e9\'ef\'f2, \'f0\'ef\'ed\'e7\'f1\'fc\'f2, \'ec\'ef\'f7\'e8\'e7\'f1\'fc\'f2]; the
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 latter two names really denoting the vulgar man as labour-slave
\par and beast of burden)--and how, conversely, "bad," "low," "unhappy"
\par have never ceased to ring in the Greek ear with a tone in which
\par "unhappy" is the predominant note: this is a heritage of the old noble
\par aristocratic morality, which remains true to itself even in contempt
\par (let philologists remember the sense in which }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u8000\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'e9\'e6\'f5\'f1\'fc\'f2, }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u7940\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'ed\'ef\'eb\'e2
\'ef\'f2, \'f4\'eb\'de\'ec\'f9\'ed,
\par \'e4\'f5\'f3\'f4\'f5\'f7\'e5}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u8145\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'ed, \'ee\'f5\'ec\'f6\'ef\'f1\'dc used to be employed). The "well-born" simply
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 _felt_ themselves the "happy"; they did not have to manufacture their
\par happiness artificially through looking at their enemies, or in cases
\par to talk and _lie themselves_ into happiness (as is the custom with all
\par resentful men); and similarly, complete men as they were, exuberant
\par with strength, and consequently _necessarily_ energetic, they were too
\par wise to dissociate happiness from action--activity becomes in their
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 minds necessarily counted as happiness (that is the etymology of \'e5}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u8022\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'f0\'f1}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u7942\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'f4\'f4\'e5\'e9\'ed)--all in sharp contrast to the "happiness" of the weak and
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 the oppressed, with their festering venom and malignity, among whom
\par happiness appears essentially as a narcotic, a deadening, a quietude,
\par a peace, a "Sabbath," an enervation of the mind and relaxation
\par of the limbs,--in short, a purely _passive_ phenomenon. While the
\par aristocratic man lived in confidence and openness with himself
\par (gennaios, "noble-born," emphasises the nuance "sincere," and perhaps
\par also "na\'eff"), the resentful man, on the other hand, is neither sincere
\par nor na\'eff, nor honest and candid with himself. His soul _squints_; his
\par mind loves hidden crannies, tortuous paths and back-doors, everything
\par secret appeals to him as _his_ world, _his_ safety, _his_ balm; he is
\par past master in silence, in not forgetting, in waiting, in provisional
\par self-depreciation and self-abasement. A race of such _resentful_ men
\par will of necessity eventually prove more _prudent_ than any aristocratic
\par race, it will honour prudence on quite a distinct scale, as, in fact, a
\par paramount condition of existence, while prudence among aristocratic men
\par is apt to be tinged with a delicate flavour of luxury and refinement;
\par so among them it plays nothing like so integral a part as that complete
\par certainty of function of the governing _unconscious_ instincts, or
\par as indeed a certain lack of prudence, such as a vehement and valiant
\par charge, whether against danger or the enemy, or as those ecstatic
\par bursts of rage, love, reverence, gratitude, by which at all times
\par noble souls have recognised each other. When the resentment of the
\par aristocratic man manifests itself, it fulfils and exhausts itself in
\par an immediate reaction, and consequently instills no _venom_: on the
\par other hand, it never manifests itself at all in countless instances,
\par when in the case of the feeble and weak it would be inevitable. An
\par inability to take seriously for any length of time their enemies,
\par their disasters, their _misdeeds_--that is the sign of the full strong
\par natures who possess a superfluity of moulding plastic force, that
\par heals completely and produces forgetfulness: a good example of this in
\par the modern world is Mirabeau, who had no memory for any insults and
\par meannesses which were practised on him, and who was only incapable
\par of forgiving because he forgot. Such a man indeed shakes off with a
\par shrug many a worm which would have buried itself in another; it is
\par only in characters like these that we see the possibility (supposing,
\par of course, that there is such a possibility in the world) of the real
\par "_love_ of one's enemies." What respect for his enemies is found,
\par forsooth, in an aristocratic man--and such a reverence is already
\par a bridge to love! He insists on having his enemy to himself as his
\par distinction. He tolerates no other enemy but a man in whose character
\par there is nothing to despise and much to honour! On the other hand,
\par imagine the "enemy" as the resentful man conceives him--and it is here
\par exactly that we see his work, his creativeness; he has conceived "the
\par evil enemy," the "evil one," and indeed that is the root idea from
\par which he now evolves as a contrasting and corresponding figure a "good
\par one," himself--his very self!
\par 
\par 
\par 11
\par 
\par The method of this man is quite contrary to that of the aristocratic
\par man, who conceives the root idea "good" spontaneously and straight
\par away, that is to say, out of himself, and from that material then
\par creates for himself a concept of "bad"! This "bad" of aristocratic
\par origin and that "evil" out of the cauldron of unsatisfied hatred--the
\par former an imitation, an "extra," an additional nuance; the latter,
\par on the other hand, the original, the beginning, the essential act in
\par the conception of a slave-morality--these two words "bad" and "evil,"
\par how great a difference do they mark, in spite of the fact that they
\par have an identical contrary in the idea "good." But the idea "good" is
\par not the same: much rather let the question be asked, "Who is really
\par evil according to the meaning of the morality of resentment?" In
\par all sternness let it be answered thus:--_just_ the good man of the
\par other morality, just the aristocrat, the powerful one, the one who
\par rules, but who is distorted by the venomous eye of resentfulness,
\par into a new colour, a new signification, a new appearance. This
\par particular point we would be the last to deny: the man who learnt to
\par know those "good" ones only as enemies, learnt at the same time not
\par to know them only as "_evil enemies_" and the same men who _inter
\par pares_ were kept so rigorously in bounds through convention, respect,
\par custom, and gratitude, though much more through mutual vigilance
\par and jealousy _inter pares_, these men who in their relations with
\par each other find so many new ways of manifesting consideration,
\par self-control, delicacy, loyalty, pride, and friendship, these men
\par are in reference to what is outside their circle (where the foreign
\par element, a _foreign_ country, begins), not much better than beasts
\par of prey, which have been let loose. They enjoy there freedom from
\par all social control, they feel that in the wilderness they can give
\par vent with impunity to that tension which is produced by enclosure and
\par imprisonment in the peace of society, they _revert_ to the innocence
\par of the beast-of-prey conscience, like jubilant monsters, who perhaps
\par come from a ghastly bout of murder, arson, rape, and torture, with
\par bravado and a moral equanimity, as though merely some wild student's
\par prank had been played, perfectly convinced that the poets have now an
\par ample theme to sing and celebrate. It is impossible not to recognise
\par at the core of all these aristocratic races the beast of prey; the
\par magnificent _blonde brute_, avidly rampant for spoil and victory;
\par this hidden core needed an outlet from time to time, the beast must
\par get loose again, must return into the wilderness--the Roman, Arabic,
\par German, and Japanese nobility, the Homeric heroes, the Scandinavian
\par Vikings, are all alike in this need. It is the aristocratic races who
\par have left the idea "Barbarian" on all the tracks in which they have
\par marched; nay, a consciousness of this very barbarianism, and even
\par a pride in it, manifests itself even in their highest civilisation
\par (for example, when Pericles says to his Athenians in that celebrated
\par funeral oration, "Our audacity has forced a way over every land and
\par sea, rearing everywhere imperishable memorials of itself for _good_
\par and for _evil_"). This audacity of aristocratic races, mad, absurd,
\par and spasmodic as may be its expression; the incalculable and fantastic
\par nature of their enterprises,Pericles sets in special relief and
\par glory the }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u8125\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'f1\'e1\'e8\'f5\'ec\'df\'e1 of the Athenians, their nonchalance and contempt for
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 safety, body, life, and comfort, their awful joy and intense delight
\par in all destruction, in all the ecstasies of victory and cruelty,--all
\par these features become crystallised, for those who suffered thereby
\par in the picture of the "barbarian," of the "evil enemy," perhaps of
\par the "Goth" and of the "Vandal." The profound, icy mistrust which
\par the German provokes, as soon as he arrives at power,--even at the
\par present time,--is always still an aftermath of that inextinguishable
\par horror with which for whole centuries Europe has regarded the wrath
\par of the blonde Teuton beast (although between the old Germans and
\par ourselves there exists scarcely a psychological, let alone a physical,
\par relationship). I have once called attention to the embarrassment of
\par Hesiod, when he conceived the series of social ages, and endeavoured
\par to express them in gold, silver, and bronze. He could only dispose
\par of the contradiction, with which he was confronted, by the Homeric
\par world, an age magnificent indeed, but at the same time so awful and
\par so violent, by making two ages out of one, which he henceforth placed
\par one behind each other--first, the age of the heroes and demigods, as
\par that world had remained in the memories of the aristocratic families,
\par who found therein their own ancestors; secondly, the bronze age, as
\par that corresponding age appeared to the descendants of the oppressed,
\par spoiled, ill-treated, exiled, enslaved; namely, as an age of bronze,
\par as I have said, hard, cold, terrible, without feelings and without
\par conscience, crushing everything, and bespattering everything with
\par blood. Granted the truth of the theory now believed to be true, that
\par the very _essence of all civilisation_ is to _train_ out of man, the
\par beast of prey, a tame and civilised animal, a domesticated animal,
\par it follows indubitably that we must regard as the real _tools of
\par civilisation_ all those instincts of reaction and resentment, by the
\par help of which the aristocratic races, together with their ideals,
\par were finally degraded and overpowered; though that has not yet come
\par to be synonymous with saying that the bearers of those tools also
\par _represented_ the civilisation. It is rather the contrary that is
\par not only probable--nay, it is _palpable_ to-day; these bearers of
\par vindictive instincts that have to be bottled up, these descendants of
\par all European and non-European slavery, especially of the pre-Aryan
\par population--these people, I say, represent the _decline_ of humanity!
\par These "tools of civilisation" are a disgrace to humanity, and
\par constitute in reality more of an argument against civilisation, more
\par of a reason why civilisation should be suspected. One may be perfectly
\par justified in being always afraid of the blonde beast that lies at
\par the core of all aristocratic races, and in being on one's guard: but
\par who would not a hundred times prefer to be afraid, when one at the
\par same time admires, than to be immune from fear, at the cost of being
\par perpetually obsessed with the loathsome spectacle of the distorted, the
\par dwarfed, the stunted, the envenomed? And is that not our fate? What
\par produces to-day our repulsion towards "man"?--for we _suffer_ from
\par "man," there is no doubt about it. It is not fear; it is rather that
\par we have nothing more to fear from men; it is that the worm "man" is in
\par the foreground and pullulates; it is that the "tame man," the wretched
\par mediocre and unedifying creature, has learnt to consider himself a goal
\par and a pinnacle, an inner meaning, an historic principle, a "higher
\par man"; yes, it is that he has a certain right so to consider himself,
\par in so far as he feels that in contrast to that excess of deformity,
\par disease, exhaustion, and effeteness whose odour is beginning to pollute
\par present-day Europe, he at any rate has achieved a relative success, he
\par at any rate still says "yes" to life.
\par 
\par 
\par 12.
\par 
\par I cannot refrain at this juncture from uttering a sigh and one last
\par hope. What is it precisely which I find intolerable? That which I alone
\par cannot get rid of, which makes me choke and faint? Bad air! bad air!
\par That something misbegotten comes near me; that I must inhale the odour
\par of the entrails of a misbegotten soul!--That excepted, what can one
\par not endure in the way of need, privation, bad weather, sickness, toil,
\par solitude? In point of fact, one manages to get over everything, born
\par as one is to a burrowing and battling existence; one always returns
\par once again to the light, one always lives again one's golden hour of
\par victory--and then one stands as one was born, unbreakable, tense, ready
\par for something more difficult, for something more distant, like a bow
\par stretched but the tauter by every strain. But from time to time do ye
\par grant me--assuming that "beyond good and evil" there are goddesses who
\par can grant--one glimpse, grant me but one glimpse only, of something
\par perfect, fully realised, happy, mighty, triumphant, of something
\par that still gives cause for fear! A glimpse of a man that justifies
\par the existence of man, a glimpse of an incarnate human happiness that
\par realises and redeems, for the sake of which one may hold fast to _the
\par belief in man_! For the position is this: in the dwarfing and levelling
\par of the European man lurks _our_ greatest peril, for it is this outlook
\par which fatigues--we see to-day nothing which wishes to be greater, we
\par surmise that the process is always still backwards, still backwards
\par towards something more attenuated, more inoffensive, more cunning,
\par more comfortable, more mediocre, more indifferent, more Chinese, more
\par Christian--man, there is no doubt about it, grows always "better"
\par --the destiny of Europe lies even in this--that in losing the fear of
\par man, we have also lost the hope in man, yea, the will to be man. The
\par sight of man now fatigues.--What is present-day Nihilism if it is not
\par _that_?--We are tired of _man_.
\par 
\par 
\par 13.
\par 
\par But let us come back to it; the problem of another origin of the
\par _good_--of the good, as the resentful man has thought it out--demands
\par its solution. It is not surprising that the lambs should bear a grudge
\par against the great birds of prey, but that is no reason for blaming the
\par great birds of prey for taking the little lambs. And when the lambs
\par say among themselves, "These birds of prey are evil, and he who is as
\par far removed from being a bird of prey, who is rather its opposite,
\par a lamb,--is he not good?" then there is nothing to cavil at in the
\par setting up of this ideal, though it may also be that the birds of prey
\par will regard it a little sneeringly, and perchance say to themselves,
\par "_We_ bear no grudge against them, these good lambs, we even like them:
\par nothing is tastier than a tender lamb." To require of strength that it
\par should not express itself as strength, that it should not be a wish to
\par overpower, a wish to overthrow, a wish to become master, a thirst for
\par enemies and antagonisms and triumphs, is just as absurd as to require
\par of weakness that it should express itself as strength. A quantum of
\par force is just such a quantum of movement, will, action--rather it
\par is nothing else than just those very phenomena of moving, willing,
\par acting, and can only appear otherwise in the misleading errors of
\par language (and the fundamental fallacies of reason which have become
\par petrified therein), which understands, and understands wrongly, all
\par working as conditioned by a worker, by a "subject." And just exactly
\par as the people separate the lightning from its flash, and interpret the
\par latter as a thing done, as the working of a subject which is called
\par lightning, so also does the popular morality separate strength from the
\par expression of strength, as though behind the strong man there existed
\par some indifferent neutral _substratum_, which enjoyed a _caprice and
\par option_ as to whether or not it should express strength. But there
\par is no such _substratum_, there is no "being" behind doing, working,
\par becoming; "the doer" is a mere appanage to the action. The action is
\par everything. In point of fact, the people duplicate the doing, when they
\par make the lightning lighten, that is a "doing-doing": they make the same
\par phenomenon first a cause, and then, secondly, the effect of that cause.
\par The scientists fail to improve matters when they say, "Force moves,
\par force causes," and so on. Our whole science is still, in spite of all
\par its coldness, of all its freedom from passion, a dupe of the tricks of
\par language, and has never succeeded in getting rid of that superstitious
\par changeling "the subject" (the atom, to give another instance, is such
\par a changeling, just as the Kantian "Thing-in-itself"). What wonder,
\par if the suppressed and stealthily simmering passions of revenge and
\par hatred exploit for their own advantage this belief, and indeed hold no
\par belief with a more steadfast enthusiasm than this--"that the strong
\par has the _option_ of being weak, and the bird of prey of being a lamb."
\par Thereby do they win for themselves the right of attributing to the
\par birds of prey the _responsibility_ for being birds of prey: when the
\par oppressed, down-trodden, and overpowered say to themselves with the
\par vindictive guile of weakness, "Let us be otherwise than the evil,
\par namely, good! and good is every one who does not oppress, who hurts
\par no one, who does not attack, who does not pay back, who hands over
\par revenge to God, who holds himself, as we do, in hiding; who goes out
\par of the way of evil, and demands, in short, little from life; like
\par ourselves the patient, the meek, the just,"--yet all this, in its cold
\par and unprejudiced interpretation, means nothing more than "once for
\par all, the weak are weak; it is good to do _nothing for which we are not
\par strong enough_"; but this dismal state of affairs, this prudence of the
\par lowest order, which even insects possess (which in a great danger are
\par fain to sham death so as to avoid doing "too much"), has, thanks to
\par the counterfeiting and self-deception of weakness, come to masquerade
\par in the pomp of an ascetic, mute, and expectant virtue, just as though
\par the _very_ weakness of the weak--that is, forsooth, its _being_, its
\par working, its whole unique inevitable inseparable reality--were a
\par voluntary result, something wished, chosen, a deed, an act of _merit_.
\par This kind of man finds the belief in a neutral, free-choosing "subject"
\par _necessary_ from an instinct of self-preservation, of self-assertion,
\par in which every lie is fain to sanctify itself. The subject (or, to
\par use popular language, the _soul_) has perhaps proved itself the best
\par dogma in the world simply because it rendered possible to the horde
\par of mortal, weak, and oppressed individuals of every kind, that most
\par sublime specimen of self-deception, the interpretation of weakness as
\par freedom, of being this, or being that, as _merit_.
\par 
\par 
\par 14.
\par 
\par Will any one look a little into--right into--the mystery of how _ideals
\par are manufactured_ in this world? Who has the courage to do it? Come!
\par 
\par Here we have a vista opened into these grimy workshops. Wait just a
\par moment, dear Mr. Inquisitive and Foolhardy; your eye must first grow
\par accustomed to this false changing light--Yes! Enough! Now speak! What
\par is happening below down yonder? Speak out that what you see, man of the
\par most dangerous curiosity--for now _I_ am the listener.
\par 
\par "I see nothing, I hear the more. It is a cautious, spiteful, gentle
\par whispering and muttering together in all the corners and crannies. It
\par seems to me that they are lying; a sugary softness adheres to every
\par sound. Weakness is turned to _merit_, there is no doubt about it--it is
\par just as you say."
\par 
\par Further!
\par 
\par "And the impotence which requites not, is turned to 'goodness,' craven
\par baseness to meekness, submission to those whom one hates, to obedience
\par (namely, obedience to one of whom they say that he ordered this
\par submission--they call him God). The inoffensive character of the weak,
\par the very cowardice in which he is rich, his standing at the door, his
\par forced necessity of waiting, gain here fine names, such as 'patience,'
\par which is also called 'virtue'; not being able to avenge one's self, is
\par called not wishing to avenge one's self, perhaps even forgiveness (for
\par _they_ know not what they do--we alone know what _they_ do). They also
\par talk of the 'love of their enemies' and sweat thereby."
\par 
\par Further!
\par 
\par "They are miserable, there is no doubt about it, all these whisperers
\par and counterfeiters in the corners, although they try to get warm by
\par crouching close to each other, but they tell me that their misery is
\par a favour and distinction given to them by God, just as one beats the
\par dogs one likes best; that perhaps this misery is also a preparation, a
\par probation, a training; that perhaps it is still more something which
\par will one day be compensated and paid back with a tremendous interest in
\par gold, nay in happiness. This they call 'Blessedness.'"
\par 
\par Further!
\par 
\par "They are now giving me to understand, that not only are they better
\par men than the mighty, the lords of the earth, whose spittle they have
\par got to lick (not out of fear, not at all out of fear! But because
\par God ordains that one should honour all authority)--not only are they
\par better men, but that they also have a 'better time,' at any rate,
\par will one day have a 'better time.' But enough! Enough! I can endure
\par it no longer. Bad air! Bad air! These workshops _where ideals are
\par manufactured_--verily they reek with the crassest lies."
\par 
\par Nay. Just one minute! You are saying nothing about the masterpieces
\par of these virtuosos of black magic, who can produce whiteness, milk,
\par and innocence out of any black you like: have you not noticed what a
\par pitch of refinement is attained by their _chef d'\'9cuvre_, their most
\par audacious, subtle, ingenious, and lying artist-trick? Take care! These
\par cellar-beasts, full of revenge and hate--what do they make, forsooth,
\par out of their revenge and hate? Do you hear these words? Would you
\par suspect, if you trusted only their words, that you are among men of
\par resentment and nothing else?
\par 
\par "I understand, I prick my ears up again (ah! ah! ah! and I hold my
\par nose). Now do I hear for the first time that which they have said so
\par often: 'We good, _we are the righteous_'--what they demand they call
\par not revenge but 'the triumph of _righteousness_'; what they hate is
\par not their enemy, no, they hate 'unrighteousness,' 'godlessness'; what
\par they believe in and hope is not the hope of revenge, the intoxication
\par of sweet revenge (--"sweeter than honey," did Homer call it?), but the
\par victory of God, of the _righteous_ _God_ over the 'godless'; what is
\par left for them to love in this world is not _their_ brothers in hate,
\par but their 'brothers in love,' as they say, all the good and righteous
\par on the earth."
\par 
\par And how do they name that which serves them as a solace against all
\par the troubles of life--their phantasmagoria of their anticipated future
\par blessedness?
\par 
\par "How? Do I hear right? They call it 'the last judgment,' the advent of
\par their kingdom, 'the kingdom of God'--but _in the meanwhile_ they live
\par 'in faith,' 'in love,' 'in hope.'"
\par 
\par Enough! Enough!
\par 
\par 
\par 15.
\par 
\par In the faith in what? In the love for what? In the hope of what? These
\par weaklings!--they also, forsooth, wish to be the strong some time; there
\par is no doubt about it, some time _their_ kingdom also must come--"the
\par kingdom of God" is their name for it, as has been mentioned: they are
\par so meek in everything! Yet in order to experience _that_ kingdom it
\par is necessary to live long, to live beyond death,--yes, _eternal_ life
\par is necessary so that one can make up for ever for that earthly life
\par "in faith," "in love," "in hope." Make up for what? Make up by what?
\par Dante, as it seems to me, made a crass mistake when with awe-inspiring
\par ingenuity he placed that inscription over the gate of his hell, "Me too
\par made eternal love": at any rate the following inscription would have
\par a much better right to stand over the gate of the Christian Paradise
\par and its "eternal blessedness"--"Me too made eternal hate"--granted
\par of course that a truth may rightly stand over the gate to a lie! For
\par what is the blessedness of that Paradise? Possibly we could quickly
\par surmise it; but it is better that it should be explicitly attested by
\par an authority who in such matters is not to be disparaged, Thomas of
\par Aquinas, the great teacher and saint. "_Beati in regno celesti_" says
\par he, as gently as a lamb, "_videbunt p\'9cnas damnatorum, ut beatitudo
\par illis magis complaceat_." Or if we wish to hear a stronger tone, a word
\par from the mouth of a triumphant father of the Church, who warned his
\par disciples against the cruel ecstasies of the public spectacles--But
\par why? Faith offers us much more,--says he, _de Spectac._, c. 29
\par ss.,--something much stronger; thanks to the redemption, joys of quite
\par another kind stand at our disposal; instead of athletes we have our
\par martyrs; we wish for blood, well, we have the blood of Christ--but
\par what then awaits us on the day of his return, of his triumph. And
\par then does he proceed, does this enraptured visionary: "_at enim
\par supersunt alia spectacula, ille ultimas et perpetuus judicii dies, ille
\par nationibus insperatus, ille derisus, cum tanta s\'e6culi vetustas et tot
\par ejus nativitates uno igne haurientur. Qu\'e6 tunc spectaculi latitudo!
\par Quid admirer! quid rideam! Ubigaudeam! Ubi exultem, spectans tot et
\par tantos reges, qui in c\'9clum recepti nuntiabantur, cum ipso Jove et ipsis
\par suis testibus in imis tenebris congemescentes! Item pr\'e6sides_" (the
\par provincial governors) "_persecutores dominici nominis s\'e6vioribus quam
\par ipsi flammis s\'e6vierunt insultantibus contra Christianos liquescentes!
\par Quos pr\'e6terea sapientes illos philosophos coram discipulis suis una
\par conflagrantibus erubescentes, quibus nihil ad deum pertinere suadebant,
\par quibus animas aut nullas aut non in pristina corpora redituras
\par affirmabant! Etiam poetas non ad Rhadamanti nec ad Minois, sed ad
\par inopinati Christi tribunal palpitantes! Tunc magis trag\'9cdi audiendi,
\par magis scilicet vocales_" (with louder tones and more violent shrieks)
\par "_in sua propria calamitate; tunc histriones cognoscendi, solutiores
\par multo per ignem; tunc spectandus auriga in flammea rota totus rubens,
\par tunc xystici contemplandi non in gymnasiis, sed in igne jaculati, nisi
\par quod ne tunc quidem illos velim vivos, ut qui malim ad eos potius
\par conspectum insatiabilem conferre, qui in dominum scevierunt. Hic est
\par ille, dicam fabri aut qu\'e6stuari\'e6 filius_" (as is shown by the whole of
\par the following, and in particular by this well-known description of the
\par mother of Jesus from the Talmud, Tertullian is henceforth referring to
\par the Jews), "_sabbati destructor, Samarites et d\'e6monium habens. Hic est
\par quem a Juda redemistis, hic est ille arundine et colaphis diverberatus,
\par sputamentis de decoratus, felle et acete potatus. Hic est, quem
\par clam discentes subripuerunt, ut resurrexisse dicatur vel hortulanus
\par detraxit, ne lactuc\'e6 su\'e6 frequentia commeantium laderentur. Ut talia
\par species, ut talibus exultes, quis tibi pr\'e6tor aut consul aut sacerdos
\par de sua liberalitate prastabit? Et tamen h\'e6c jam habemus quodammodo per
\par fidem spiritu imaginante repr\'e6sentata. Ceterum qualia illa sunt, qu\'e6
\par nec oculus vidit nec auris audivit nec in cor hominis ascenderunt?_" (I
\par Cor. ii. 9.) "_Credo circo et utraque cavea_" (first and fourth row,
\par or, according to others, the comic and the tragic stage) "_et omni
\par studio gratiora._" _Per fidem_: so stands it written.

\par 
\par 16.
\par 
\par Let us come to a conclusion. The two _opposing values_, "good and bad,"
\par "good and evil," have fought a dreadful, thousand-year fight in the
\par world, and though indubitably the second value has been for a long time
\par in the preponderance, there are not wanting places where the fortune
\par of the fight is still undecisive. It can almost be said that in the
\par meanwhile the fight reaches a higher and higher level, and that in the
\par meanwhile it has become more and more intense, and always more and more
\par psychological; so that nowadays there is perhaps no more decisive mark
\par of the _higher nature_, of the more psychological nature, than to be in
\par that sense self-contradictory, and to be actually still a battleground
\par for those two opposites. The symbol of this fight, written in a writing
\par which has remained worthy of perusal throughout the course of history
\par up to the present time, is called "Rome against Jud\'e6a, Jud\'e6a against
\par Rome." Hitherto there has been no greater event than _that_ fight,
\par the putting of _that_ question, _that_ deadly antagonism. Rome found
\par in the Jew the incarnation of the unnatural, as though it were its
\par diametrically opposed monstrosity, and in Rome the Jew was held to
\par be _convicted of hatred_ of the whole human race: and rightly so, in
\par so far as it is right to link the well-being and the future of the
\par human race to the unconditional mastery of the aristocratic values, of
\par the Roman values. What, conversely, did the Jews feel against Rome?
\par One can surmise it from a thousand symptoms, but it is sufficient to
\par carry one's mind back to the Johannian Apocalypse, that most obscene
\par of all the written outbursts, which has revenge on its conscience.
\par (One should also appraise at its full value the profound logic of the
\par Christian instinct, when over this very book of hate it wrote the name
\par of the Disciple of Love, that self-same disciple to whom it attributed
\par that impassioned and ecstatic Gospel--therein lurks a portion of
\par truth, however much literary forging may have been necessary for
\par this purpose.) The Romans were the strong and aristocratic; a nation
\par stronger and more aristocratic has never existed in the world, has
\par never even been dreamed of; every relic of them, every inscription
\par enraptures, granted that one can divine _what_ it is that writes the
\par inscription. The Jews, conversely, were that priestly nation of
\par resentment par excellence, possessed by a unique genius for popular
\par morals: just compare with the Jews the nations with analogous gifts,
\par such as the Chinese or the Germans, so as to realise afterwards what is
\par first rate, and what is fifth rate.
\par 
\par Which of them has been provisionally victorious, Rome or Jud\'e6a? but
\par there is not a shadow of doubt; just consider to whom in Rome itself
\par nowadays you bow down, as though before the quintessence of all the
\par highest values--and not only in Rome, but almost over half the world,
\par everywhere where man has been tamed or is about to be tamed--to _three
\par Jews_, as we know, and _one Jewess_ (to Jesus of Nazareth, to Peter
\par the fisher, to Paul the tent-maker, and to the mother of the aforesaid
\par Jesus, named Mary). This is very remarkable: Rome is undoubtedly
\par defeated. At any rate there took place in the Renaissance a brilliantly
\par sinister revival of the classical ideal, of the aristocratic valuation
\par of all things: Rome herself, like a man waking up from a trance,
\par stirred beneath the burden of the new Judaised Rome that had been built
\par over her, which presented the appearance of an \'9ccumenical synagogue
\par and was called the "Church": but immediately Jud\'e6a triumphed again,
\par thanks to that fundamentally popular (German and English) movement
\par of revenge, which is called the Reformation, and taking also into
\par account its inevitable corollary, the restoration of the Church--the
\par restoration also of the ancient graveyard peace of classical Rome.
\par Jud\'e6a proved yet once more victorious over the classical ideal in the
\par French Revolution, and in a sense which was even more crucial and even
\par more profound: the last political aristocracy that existed in Europe,
\par that of the _French_ seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, broke into
\par pieces beneath the instincts of a resentful populace--never had the
\par world heard a greater jubilation, a more uproarious enthusiasm: indeed,
\par there took place in the midst of it the most monstrous and unexpected
\par phenomenon; the ancient ideal _itself_ swept before the eyes and
\par conscience of humanity with all its life and with unheard-of splendour,
\par and in opposition to resentment's lying war-cry of _the prerogative
\par of the most_, in opposition to the will to lowliness, abasement, and
\par equalisation, the will to a retrogression and twilight of humanity,
\par there rang out once again, stronger, simpler, more penetrating than
\par ever, the terrible and enchanting counter-warcry of _the prerogative of
\par the few_! Like a final signpost to other ways, there appeared Napoleon,
\par the most unique and violent anachronism that ever existed, and in him
\par the incarnate problem _of the aristocratic ideal in itself_--consider
\par well what a problem it is:--Napoleon, that synthesis of Monster and
\par Superman.
\par 
\par 
\par 17.
\par 
\par Was it therewith over? Was that greatest of all antitheses of ideals
\par thereby relegated _ad acta_ for all time? Or only postponed, postponed
\par for a long time? May there not take place at some time or other a
\par much more awful, much more carefully prepared flaring up of the old
\par conflagration? Further! Should not one wish _that_ consummation with
\par all one's strength?--will it one's self? demand it one's self? He who
\par at this juncture begins, like my readers, to reflect, to think further,
\par will have difficulty in coming quickly to a conclusion,--ground enough
\par for me to come myself to a conclusion, taking it for granted that for
\par some time past what I mean has been sufficiently clear, what I exactly
\par _mean_ by that dangerous motto which is inscribed on the body of my
\par last book: _Beyond Good and Evil_--at any rate that is not the same as
\par "Beyond Good and Bad."
\par 
\par 
\par Note.--I avail myself of the opportunity offered by this treatise to
\par express, openly and formally, a wish which up to the present has only
\par been expressed in occasional conversations with scholars, namely,
\par that some Faculty of philosophy should, by means of a series of prize
\par essays, gain the glory of having promoted the further study of the
\par _history of morals_--perhaps this book may serve to give forcible
\par impetus in such a direction. With regard to a possibility of this
\par character, the following question deserves consideration. It merits
\par quite as much the attention of philologists and historians as of actual
\par professional philosophers.
\par 
\par "_What indication of the history of the evolution of the moral ideas is
\par afforded by philology, and especially by etymological investigation?_"
\par 
\par On the other hand, it is of course equally necessary to induce
\par physiologists and doctors to be interested in these problems (_of the
\par value of the valuations_ which have prevailed up to the present): in
\par this connection the professional philosophers may be trusted to act
\par as the spokesmen and intermediaries in these particular instances,
\par after, of course, they have quite succeeded in transforming the
\par relationship between philosophy and physiology and medicine, which
\par is originally one of coldness and suspicion, into the most friendly
\par and fruitful reciprocity. In point of fact, all tables of values,
\par all the "thou shalts" known to history and ethnology, need primarily
\par a _physiological_, at any rate in preference to a psychological,
\par elucidation and interpretation; all equally require a critique from
\par medical science. The question, "What is the _value_ of this or that
\par table of 'values' and morality?" will be asked from the most varied
\par standpoints. For instance, the question of "valuable _for what_" can
\par never be analysed with sufficient nicety. That, for instance, which
\par would evidently have value with regard to promoting in a race the
\par greatest possible powers of endurance (or with regard to increasing its
\par adaptability to a specific climate, or with regard to the preservation
\par of the greatest number) would have nothing like the same value, if it
\par were a question of evolving a stronger species. In gauging values,
\par the good of the majority and the good of the minority are opposed
\par standpoints: we leave it to the na\'efvet\'e9 of English biologists to regard
\par the former standpoint as _intrinsically_ superior. _All_ the sciences
\par have now to pave the way for the future task of the philosopher; this
\par task being understood to mean, that he must solve the problem of
\par _value_, that he has to fix the _hierarchy of values_.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par SECOND ESSAY. "GUILT," "BAD CONSCIENCE," AND THE LIKE.
\par 
\par 
\par 1.
\par 
\par The breeding of an animal that _can promise_--is not this just that
\par very paradox of a task which nature has set itself in regard to man? Is
\par not this the very problem of man? The fact that this problem has been
\par to a great extent solved, must appear all the more phenomenal to one
\par who can estimate at its full value that force of _forgetfulness_ which
\par works in opposition to it. Forgetfulness is no mere _vis inerti\'e6_,
\par as the superficial believe, rather is it a power of obstruction,
\par active and, in the strictest sense of the word, positive--a power
\par responsible for the fact that what we have lived, experienced, taken
\par into ourselves, no more enters into consciousness during the process
\par of digestion (it might be called psychic absorption) than all the
\par whole manifold process by which our physical nutrition, the so-called
\par "incorporation," is carried on. The temporary shutting of the doors
\par and windows of consciousness, the relief from the clamant alarums and
\par excursions, with which our subconscious world of servant organs works
\par in mutual co-operation and antagonism; a little quietude, a little
\par _tabula rasa_ of the consciousness, so as to make room again for the
\par new, and above all for the more noble functions and functionaries, room
\par for government, foresight, predetermination (for our organism is on an
\par oligarchic model)--this is the utility, as I have said, of the active
\par forgetfulness, which is a very sentinel and nurse of psychic order,
\par repose, etiquette; and this shows at once why it is that there can
\par exist no happiness, no gladness, no hope, no pride, no real _present_,
\par without forgetfulness. The man in whom this preventative apparatus is
\par damaged and discarded, is to be compared to a dyspeptic, and it is
\par something more than a comparison--he can "get rid of" nothing. But
\par this very animal who finds it necessary to be forgetful, in whom, in
\par fact, forgetfulness represents a force and a form of _robust_ health,
\par has reared for himself an opposition-power, a memory, with whose help
\par forgetfulness is, in certain instances, kept in check--in the cases,
\par namely, where promises have to be made;--so that it is by no means
\par a mere passive inability to get rid of a once indented impression,
\par not merely the indigestion occasioned by a once pledged word, which
\par one cannot dispose of, but an _active_ refusal to get rid of it, a
\par continuing and a wish to continue what has once been willed, an actual
\par _memory of the will_; so that between the original "I will," "I shall
\par do," and the actual discharge of the will, its act, we can easily
\par interpose a world of new strange phenomena, circumstances, veritable
\par volitions, without the snapping of this long chain of the will. But
\par what is the underlying hypothesis of all this? How thoroughly, in order
\par to be able to regulate the future in this way, must man have first
\par learnt to distinguish between necessitated and accidental phenomena, to
\par think causally, to see the distant as present and to anticipate it, to
\par fix with certainty what is the end, and what is the means to that end;
\par above all, to reckon, to have power to calculate--how thoroughly must
\par man have first become _calculable, disciplined, necessitated_ even for
\par himself and his own conception of himself, that, like a man entering
\par into a promise, he could guarantee himself _as a future_.
\par 
\par 
\par 2.
\par 
\par This is simply the long history of the origin of _responsibility_.
\par That task of breeding an animal which can make promises, includes, as
\par we have already grasped, as its condition and preliminary, the more
\par immediate task of first _making_ man to a certain extent, necessitated,
\par uniform, like among his like, regular, and consequently calculable. The
\par immense work of what I have called, "morality of custom"[1] (cp. _Dawn
\par of Day_, Aphs. 9, 14, and 16), the actual work of man on himself during
\par the longest period of the human race, his whole prehistoric work,
\par finds its meaning, its great justification (in spite of all its innate
\par hardness, despotism, stupidity, and idiocy) in this fact: man, with
\par the help of the morality of customs and of social strait-waistcoats,
\par was _made_ genuinely calculable. If, however, we place ourselves at
\par the end of this colossal process, at the point where the tree finally
\par matures its fruits, when society and its morality of custom finally
\par bring to light that to which it was only the means, then do we find as
\par the ripest fruit on its tree the _sovereign individual_, that resembles
\par only himself, that has got loose from the morality of custom, the
\par autonomous "super-moral" individual (for "autonomous" and "moral" are
\par mutually-exclusive terms),--in short, the man of the personal, long,
\par and independent will, _competent to promise_, and we find in him a
\par proud consciousness (vibrating in every fibre), of _what_ has been at
\par last achieved and become vivified in him, a genuine consciousness of
\par power and freedom, a feeling of human perfection in general. And this
\par man who has grown to freedom, who is really _competent_ to promise,
\par this lord of the _free_ will, this sovereign--how is it possible for
\par him not to know how great is his superiority over everything incapable
\par of binding itself by promises, or of being its own security, how great
\par is the trust, the awe, the reverence that he awakes--he "deserves"
\par all three--not to know that with this mastery over himself he is
\par necessarily also given the mastery over circumstances, over nature,
\par over all creatures with shorter wills, less reliable characters?
\par The "free" man, the owner of a long unbreakable will, finds in this
\par possession his _standard of value_: looking out from himself upon
\par the others, he honours or he despises, and just as necessarily as he
\par honours his peers, the strong and the reliable (those who can bind
\par themselves by promises),--that is, every one who promises like a
\par sovereign, with difficulty, rarely and slowly, who is sparing with his
\par trusts but confers _honour_ by the very fact of trusting, who gives
\par his word as something that can be relied on, because he knows himself
\par strong enough to keep it even in the teeth of disasters, even in the
\par "teeth of fate,"--so with equal necessity will he have the heel of his
\par foot ready for the lean and empty jackasses, who promise when they have
\par no business to do so, and his rod of chastisement ready for the liar,
\par who already breaks his word at the very minute when it is on his lips.
\par The proud knowledge of the extraordinary privilege of _responsibility_,
\par the consciousness of this rare freedom, of this power over himself and
\par over fate, has sunk right down to his innermost depths, and has become
\par an instinct, a dominating instinct--what name will he give to it, to
\par this dominating instinct, if he needs to have a word for it? But there
\par is no doubt about it--the sovereign man calls it his _conscience_.
\par 
\par 
\par 3.
\par 
\par His conscience?--One apprehends at once that the idea "conscience,"
\par which is here seen in its supreme manifestation, supreme in fact to
\par almost the point of strangeness, should already have behind it a long
\par history and evolution. The ability to guarantee one's self with all
\par due pride, and also at the same time to _say yes_ to one's self--that
\par is, as has been said, a ripe fruit, but also a _late_ fruit:--How long
\par must needs this fruit hang sour and bitter on the tree! And for an even
\par longer period there was not a glimpse of such a fruit to to be had--no
\par one had taken it on himself to promise it, although everything on the
\par tree was quite ready for it, and everything was maturing for that very
\par consummation. "How is a memory to be made for the man-animal? How is an
\par impression to be so deeply fixed upon this ephemeral understanding,
\par half dense, and half silly, upon this incarnate forgetfulness, that
\par it will be permanently present?" As one may imagine, this primeval
\par problem was not solved by exactly gentle answers and gentle means;
\par perhaps there is nothing more awful and more sinister in the early
\par history of man than his _system of mnemonics_. "Something is burnt in
\par so as to remain in his memory: only that which never stops _hurting_
\par remains in his memory." This is an axiom of the oldest (unfortunately
\par also the longest) psychology in the world. It might even be said that
\par wherever solemnity, seriousness, mystery, and gloomy colours are now
\par found in the life of the men and of nations of the world, there is some
\par _survival_ of that horror which was once the universal concomitant of
\par all promises, pledges, and obligations. The past, the past with all
\par its length, depth, and hardness, wafts to us its breath, and bubbles
\par up in us again, when we become "serious." When man thinks it necessary
\par to make for himself a memory, he never accomplishes it without blood,
\par tortures, and sacrifice; the most dreadful sacrifices and forfeitures
\par (among them the sacrifice of the first-born), the most loathsome
\par mutilation (for instance, castration), the most cruel rituals of all
\par the religious cults (for all religions are really at bottom systems
\par of cruelty)--all these things originate from that instinct which
\par found in pain its most potent mnemonic. In a certain sense the whole
\par of asceticism is to be ascribed to this: certain ideas have got to
\par be made inextinguishable, omnipresent, "fixed," with the object of
\par hypnotising the whole nervous and intellectual system through these
\par "fixed ideas"--and the ascetic methods and modes of life are the means
\par of freeing those ideas from the competition of all other ideas so as to
\par make them "unforgettable." The worse memory man had, the ghastlier the
\par signs presented by his customs; the severity of the penal laws affords
\par in particular a gauge of the extent of man's difficulty in conquering
\par forgetfulness, and in keeping a few primal postulates of social
\par intercourse ever present to the minds of those who were the slaves
\par of every momentary emotion and every momentary desire. We Germans do
\par certainly not regard ourselves as an especially cruel and hard-hearted
\par nation, still less as an especially casual and happy-go-lucky one;
\par but one has only to look at our old penal ordinances in order to
\par realise what a lot of trouble it takes in the world to evolve a
\par "nation of thinkers" (I mean: _the_ European nation which exhibits at
\par this very day the maximum of reliability, seriousness, bad taste, and
\par positiveness, which has on the strength of these qualities a right to
\par train every kind of European mandarin). These Germans employed terrible
\par means to make for themselves a memory, to enable them to master their
\par rooted plebeian instincts and the brutal crudity of those instincts:
\par think of the old German punishments, for instance, stoning (as far back
\par as the legend, the millstone falls on the head of the guilty man),
\par breaking on the wheel (the most original invention and speciality of
\par the German genius in the sphere of punishment), dart-throwing, tearing,
\par or trampling by horses ("quartering"), boiling the criminal in oil or
\par wine (still prevalent in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries), the
\par highly popular flaying ("slicing into strips"), cutting the flesh out
\par of the breast; think also of the evil-doer being besmeared with honey,
\par and then exposed to the flies in a blazing sun. It was by the help of
\par such images and precedents that man eventually kept in his memory five
\par or six "I will nots" with regard to which he had already given his
\par _promise_, so as to be able to enjoy the advantages of society--and
\par verily with the help of this kind of memory man eventually attained
\par "reason"! Alas! reason, seriousness, mastery over the emotions, all
\par these gloomy, dismal things which are called reflection, all these
\par privileges and pageantries of humanity: how dear is the price that they
\par have exacted! How much blood and cruelty is the foundation of all "good
\par things"!
\par 
\par 
\par 4.
\par 
\par But how is it that that other melancholy object, the consciousness of
\par sin, the whole "bad conscience," came into the world? And it is here
\par that we turn back to our genealogists of morals. For the second time
\par I say--or have I not said it yet?--that they are worth nothing. Just
\par their own five-spans-long limited modern experience; no knowledge of
\par the past, and no wish to know it; still less a historic instinct, a
\par power of "second sight" (which is what is really required in this
\par case)--and despite this to go in for the history of morals. It stands
\par to reason that this must needs produce results which are removed from
\par the truth by something more than a respectful distance.
\par 
\par Have these current genealogists of morals ever allowed themselves to
\par have even the vaguest notion, for instance, that the cardinal moral
\par idea of "ought"[2] originates from the very material idea of "owe"? Or
\par that punishment developed as a retaliation absolutely independently
\par of any preliminary hypothesis of the freedom or determination of the
\par will?--And this to such an extent, that a high degree of civilisation
\par was always first necessary for the animal man to begin to make those
\par much more primitive distinctions of "intentional," "negligent,"
\par "accidental," "responsible," and their contraries, and apply them
\par in the assessing of punishment. That idea--"the wrong-doer deserves
\par punishment _because_ he might have acted otherwise," in spite of the
\par fact that it is nowadays so cheap, obvious, natural, and inevitable,
\par and that it has had to serve as an illustration of the way in which
\par the sentiment of justice appeared on earth, is in point of fact
\par an exceedingly late, and even refined form of human judgment and
\par inference; the placing of this idea back at the beginning of the world
\par is simply a clumsy violation of the principles of primitive psychology.
\par Throughout the longest period of human history punishment was _never_
\par based on the responsibility of the evil-doer for his action, and was
\par consequently not based on the hypothesis that only the guilty should
\par be punished;--on the contrary, punishment was inflicted in those days
\par for the same reason that parents punish their children even nowadays,
\par out of anger at an injury that they have suffered, an anger which vents
\par itself mechanically on the author of the injury--but this anger is kept
\par in bounds and modified through the idea that every injury has somewhere
\par or other its _equivalent_ price, and can really be paid off, even
\par though it be by means of pain to the author. Whence is it that this
\par ancient deep-rooted and now perhaps ineradicable idea has drawn its
\par strength, this idea of an equivalency between injury and pain? I have
\par already revealed its origin, in the contractual relationship between
\par _creditor_ and _ower_, that is as old as the existence of legal rights
\par at all, and in its turn points back to the primary forms of purchase,
\par sale, barter, and trade.
\par 
\par 
\par 5.
\par 
\par The realisation of these contractual relations excites, of course (as
\par would be already expected from our previous observations), a great
\par deal of suspicion and opposition towards the primitive society which
\par made or sanctioned them. In this society promises will be made; in
\par this society the object is to provide the promiser with a memory;
\par in this society, so may we suspect, there will be full scope for
\par hardness, cruelty, and pain: the "ower," in order to induce credit
\par in his promise of repayment, in order to give a guarantee of the
\par earnestness and sanctity of his promise, in order to drill into his
\par own conscience the duty, the solemn duty, of repayment, will, by
\par virtue of a contract with his creditor to meet the contingency of
\par his not paying, pledge something that he still possesses, something
\par that he still has in his power, for instance, his life or his wife,
\par or his freedom or his body (or under certain religious conditions
\par even his salvation, his soul's welfare, even his peace in the grave;
\par so in Egypt, where the corpse of the ower found even in the grave no
\par rest from the creditor--of course, from the Egyptian standpoint, this
\par peace was a matter of particular importance). But especially has the
\par creditor the power of inflicting on the body of the ower all kinds of
\par pain and torture--the power, for instance, of cutting off from it an
\par amount that appeared proportionate to the greatness of the debt;--this
\par point of view resulted in the universal prevalence at an early date of
\par precise schemes of valuation, frequently horrible in the minuteness
\par and meticulosity of their application, _legally_ sanctioned schemes of
\par valuation for individual limbs and parts of the body. I consider it as
\par already a progress, as a proof of a freer, less petty, and more Roman
\par conception of law, when the Roman Code of the Twelve Tables decreed
\par that it was immaterial how much or how little the creditors in such a
\par contingency cut off, "si plus minusve secuerunt, ne fraude esto." Let
\par us make the logic of the whole of this equalisation process clear; it
\par is strange enough. The equivalence consists in this: instead of an
\par advantage directly compensatory of his injury (that is, instead of an
\par equalisation in money, lands, or some kind of chattel), the creditor
\par is granted by way of repayment and compensation a certain _sensation
\par of satisfaction_--the satisfaction of being able to vent, without any
\par trouble, his power on one who is powerless, the delight "_de faire le
\par mal pour le plaisir de le faire_," the joy in sheer violence: and this
\par joy will be relished in proportion to the lowness and humbleness of
\par the creditor in the social scale, and is quite apt to have the effect
\par of the most delicious dainty, and even seem the foretaste of a higher
\par social position. Thanks to the punishment of the "ower," the creditor
\par participates in the rights of the masters. At last he too, for once in
\par a way, attains the edifying consciousness of being able to despise and
\par ill-treat a creature--as an "inferior"--or at any rate of _seeing_ him
\par being despised and ill-treated, in case the actual power of punishment,
\par the administration of punishment, has already become transferred to the
\par "authorities." The compensation consequently consists in a claim on
\par cruelty and a right to draw thereon.
\par 
\par 
\par 6.
\par 
\par It is then in _this_ sphere of the law of contract that we find the
\par cradle of the whole moral world of the ideas of "guilt," "conscience,"
\par "duty," the "sacredness of duty,"--their commencement, like the
\par commencement of all great things in the world, is thoroughly and
\par continuously saturated with blood. And should we not add that this
\par world has never really lost a certain savour of blood and torture (not
\par even in old Kant; the categorical imperative reeks of cruelty). It was
\par in this sphere likewise that there first became formed that sinister
\par and perhaps now indissoluble association of the ideas of "guilt" and
\par "suffering." To put the question yet again, why can suffering be a
\par compensation for "owing"?--Because the _infliction_ of suffering
\par produces the highest degree of happiness, because the injured party
\par will get in exchange for his loss (including his vexation at his loss)
\par an extraordinary counter-pleasure: the _infliction_ of suffering--a
\par real _feast_, something that, as I have said, was all the more
\par appreciated the greater the paradox created by the rank and social
\par status of the creditor. These observations are purely conjectural; for,
\par apart from the painful nature of the task, it is hard to plumb such
\par profound depths: the clumsy introduction of the idea of "revenge" as a
\par connecting-link simply hides and obscures the view instead of rendering
\par it clearer (revenge itself simply leads back again to the identical
\par problem--"How can the infliction of suffering be a satisfaction?").
\par In my opinion it is repugnant to the delicacy, and still more to the
\par hypocrisy of tame domestic animals (that is, modern men; that is,
\par ourselves), to realise with all their energy the extent to which
\par _cruelty_ constituted the great joy and delight of ancient man, was
\par an ingredient which seasoned nearly all his pleasures, and conversely
\par the extent of the na\'efvet\'e9 and innocence with which he manifested his
\par need for cruelty, when he actually made as a matter of principle
\par "disinterested malice" (or, to use Spinoza's expression, the _sympathia
\par malevolens_) into a _normal_ characteristic of man--as consequently
\par something to which the conscience says a hearty yes. The more profound
\par observer has perhaps already had sufficient opportunity for noticing
\par this most ancient and radical joy and delight of mankind; in _Beyond
\par Good and Evil_, Aph. 188 (and even earlier, in _The Dawn of Day_, Aphs.
\par 18, 77, 113), I have cautiously indicated the continually growing
\par spiritualisation and "deification" of cruelty, which pervades the
\par whole history of the higher civilisation (and in the larger sense even
\par constitutes it). At any rate the time is not so long past when it was
\par impossible to conceive of royal weddings and national festivals on a
\par grand scale, without executions, tortures, or perhaps an _auto-da-f\'e9_",
\par or similarly to conceive of an aristocratic household, without a
\par creature to serve as a butt for the cruel and malicious baiting of the
\par inmates. (The reader will perhaps remember Don Quixote at the court of
\par the Duchess: we read nowadays the whole of _Don Quixote_ with a bitter
\par taste in the mouth, almost with a sensation of torture, a fact which
\par would appear very strange and very incomprehensible to the author and
\par his contemporaries--they read it with the best conscience in the world
\par as the gayest of books; they almost died with laughing at it.) The
\par sight of suffering does one good, the infliction of suffering does one
\par more good--this is a hard maxim, but none the less a fundamental maxim,
\par old, powerful, and "human, all-too-human"; one, moreover, to which
\par perhaps even the apes as well would subscribe: for it is said that in
\par inventing bizarre cruelties they are giving abundant proof of their
\par future humanity, to which, as it were, they are playing the prelude.
\par Without cruelty, no feast: so teaches the oldest and longest history of
\par man--and in punishment too is there so much of the festive.
\par 
\par 
\par 7.
\par 
\par Entertaining, as I do, these thoughts, I am, let me say in parenthesis,
\par fundamentally opposed to helping our pessimists to new water for the
\par discordant and groaning mills of their disgust with life; on the
\par contrary, it should be shown specifically that, at the time when
\par mankind was not yet ashamed of its cruelty, life in the world was
\par brighter than it is nowadays when there are pessimists. The darkening
\par of the heavens over man has always increased in proportion to the
\par growth of man's shame _before man_. The tired pessimistic outlook,
\par the mistrust of the riddle of life, the icy negation of disgusted
\par ennui, all those are not the signs of the _most evil_ age of the human
\par race: much rather do they come first to the light of day, as the
\par swamp-flowers, which they are, when the swamp to which they belong,
\par comes into existence--I mean the diseased refinement and moralisation,
\par thanks to which the "animal man" has at last learnt to be ashamed of
\par all his instincts. On the road to angelhood (not to use in this context
\par a harder word) man has developed that dyspeptic stomach and coated
\par tongue, which have made not only the joy and innocence of the animal
\par repulsive to him, but also life itself:--so that sometimes he stands
\par with stopped nostrils before his own self, and, like Pope Innocent the
\par Third, makes a black list of his own horrors ("unclean generation,
\par loathsome nutrition when in the maternal body, badness of the matter
\par out of which man develops, awful stench, secretion of saliva, urine,
\par and excrement"). Nowadays, when suffering is always trotted out
\par as the first argument _against_ existence, as its most sinister
\par query, it is well to remember the times when men judged on converse
\par principles because they could not dispense with the _infliction_ of
\par suffering, and saw therein a magic of the first order, a veritable
\par bait of seduction to life.
\par 
\par Perhaps in those days (this is to solace the weaklings) pain did not
\par hurt so much as it does nowadays: any physician who has treated negroes
\par (granted that these are taken as representative of the prehistoric
\par man) suffering from severe internal inflammations which would bring
\par a European, even though he had the soundest constitution, almost to
\par despair, would be in a position to come to this conclusion. Pain has
\par _not_ the same effect with negroes. (The curve of human sensibilities
\par to pain seems indeed to sink in an extraordinary and almost sudden
\par fashion, as soon as one has passed the upper ten thousand or ten
\par millions of over-civilised humanity, and I personally have no doubt
\par that, by comparison with one painful night passed by one single
\par hysterical chit of a cultured woman, the suffering of all the animals
\par taken together who have been put to the question of the knife, so as
\par to give scientific answers, are simply negligible.) We may perhaps
\par be allowed to admit the possibility of the craving for cruelty not
\par necessarily having become really extinct: it only requires, in view
\par of the fact that pain hurts more nowadays, a certain sublimation and
\par subtilisation, it must especially be translated to the imaginative and
\par psychic plane, and be adorned with such smug euphemisms, that even the
\par most fastidious and hypocritical conscience could never grow suspicious
\par of their real nature ("Tragic pity" is one of these euphemisms:
\par another is "_les nostalgies de la croix_"). What really raises one's
\par indignation against suffering is not suffering intrinsically, but
\par the senselessness of suffering; such a _senselessness_, however,
\par existed neither in Christianity, which interpreted suffering into a
\par whole mysterious salvation-apparatus, nor in the beliefs of the naive
\par ancient man, who only knew how to find a meaning in suffering from
\par the standpoint of the spectator, or the inflictor of the suffering.
\par In order to get the secret, undiscovered, and unwitnessed suffering
\par out of the world it was almost compulsory to invent gods and a
\par hierarchy of intermediate beings, in short, something which wanders
\par even among secret places, sees even in the dark, and makes a point
\par of never missing an interesting and painful spectacle. It was with
\par the help of such inventions that life got to learn the _tour de
\par force_, which has become part of its stock-in-trade, the _tour de
\par force_ of self-justification, of the justification of evil; nowadays
\par this would perhaps require other auxiliary devices (for instance,
\par life as a riddle, life as a problem of knowledge). "Every evil is
\par justified in the sight of which a god finds edification," so rang the
\par logic of primitive sentiment--and, indeed, was it only of primitive?
\par The gods conceived as friends of spectacles of cruelty--oh how far
\par does this primeval conception extend even nowadays into our European
\par civilisation! One would perhaps like in this context to consult Luther
\par and Calvin. It is at any rate certain that even the Greeks knew no
\par more piquant seasoning for the happiness of their gods than the joys
\par of cruelty. What, do you think, was the mood with which Homer makes
\par his gods look down upon the fates of men? What final meaning have at
\par bottom the Trojan War and similar tragic horrors? It is impossible to
\par entertain any doubt on the point: they were intended as festival games
\par for the gods, and, in so far as the poet is of a more godlike breed
\par than other men, as festival games also for the poets. It was in just
\par this spirit and no other, that at a later date the moral philosophers
\par of Greece conceived the eyes of God as still looking down on the moral
\par struggle, the heroism, and the self-torture of the virtuous; the
\par Heracles of duty was on a stage, and was conscious of the fact; virtue
\par without witnesses was something quite unthinkable for this nation of
\par actors. Must not that philosophic invention, so audacious and so fatal,
\par which was then absolutely new to Europe, the invention of "free will,"
\par of the absolute spontaneity of man in good and evil, simply have been
\par made for the specific purpose of justifying the idea, that the interest
\par of the gods in humanity and human virtue was _inexhaustible_?
\par 
\par There would never on the stage of this free-will world be a dearth of
\par really new, really novel and exciting situations, plots, catastrophes.
\par A world thought out on completely deterministic lines would be easily
\par guessed by the gods, and would consequently soon bore them--sufficient
\par reason for these _friends of the gods_, the philosophers, not to
\par ascribe to their gods such a deterministic world. The whole of ancient
\par humanity is full of delicate consideration for the spectator, being as
\par it is a world of thorough publicity and theatricality, which could not
\par conceive of happiness without spectacles and festivals.--And, as has
\par already been said, even in great punishment there is so much which is
\par festive.
\par 
\par 
\par 8.
\par 
\par The feeling of "ought," of personal obligation (to take up again
\par the train of our inquiry), has had, as we saw, its origin in the
\par oldest and most original personal relationship that there is, the
\par relationship between buyer and seller, creditor and ower: here it
\par was that individual confronted individual, and that individual
\par _matched himself against_ individual. There has not yet been found
\par a grade of civilisation so low, as not to manifest some trace of
\par this relationship. Making prices, assessing values, thinking out
\par equivalents, exchanging--all this preoccupied the primal thoughts
\par of man to such an extent that in a certain sense it constituted
\par _thinking_ itself: it was here that was trained the oldest form of
\par sagacity, it was here in this sphere that we can perhaps trace the
\par first commencement of man's pride, of his feeling of superiority over
\par other animals. Perhaps our word "Mensch" (_manas_) still expresses
\par just something of _this_ self-pride: man denoted himself as the being
\par who measures values, who values and measures, as the "assessing"
\par animal _par excellence_. Sale and purchase, together with their
\par psychological concomitants, are older than the origins of any form of
\par social organisation and union: it is rather from the most rudimentary
\par form of individual right that the budding consciousness of exchange,
\par commerce, debt, right, obligation, compensation was first transferred
\par to the rudest and most elementary of the social complexes (in their
\par relation to similar complexes), the habit of comparing force with
\par force, together with that of measuring, of calculating. His eye was
\par now focussed to this perspective; and with that ponderous consistency
\par characteristic of ancient thought, which, though set in motion with
\par difficulty, yet proceeds inflexibly along the line on which it has
\par started, man soon arrived at the great generalisation, "everything has
\par its price, _all_ can be paid for," the oldest and most naive moral
\par canon of _justice_, the beginning of all "kindness," of all "equity,"
\par of all "goodwill," of all "objectivity" in the world. Justice in this
\par initial phase is the goodwill among people of about equal power to come
\par to terms with each other, to come to an understanding again by means of
\par a settlement, and with regard to the less powerful, to _compel_ them
\par to agree among themselves to a settlement.
\par 
\par 
\par 9.
\par 
\par Measured always by the standard of antiquity (this antiquity, moreover,
\par is present or again possible at all periods), the community stands to
\par its members in that important and radical relationship of creditor to
\par his "owers." Man lives in a community, man enjoys the advantages of
\par a community (and what advantages! we occasionally underestimate them
\par nowadays), man lives protected, spared, in peace and trust, secure
\par from certain injuries and enmities, to which the man outside the
\par community, the "peaceless" man, is exposed,--a German understands the
\par original meaning of "Elend" (_\'ealend_),--secure because he has entered
\par into pledges and obligations to the community in respect of these very
\par injuries and enmities. What happens _when this is not the case_? The
\par community, the defrauded creditor, will get itself paid, as well as it
\par can, one can reckon on that. In this case the question of the direct
\par damage done by the offender is quite subsidiary: quite apart from
\par this the criminal[3] is above all a breaker, a breaker of word and
\par covenant _to the whole_, as regards all the advantages and amenities
\par of the communal life in which up to that time he had participated. The
\par criminal is an "ower" who not only fails to repay the advances and
\par advantages that have been given to him, but even sets out to attack
\par his creditor: consequently he is in the future not only, as is fair,
\par deprived of all these advantages and amenities--he is in addition
\par reminded of the _importance_ of those advantages. The wrath of the
\par injured creditor, of the community, puts him back in the wild and
\par outlawed status from which he was previously protected: the community
\par repudiates him--and now every kind of enmity can vent itself on him.
\par Punishment is in this stage of civilisation simply the copy, the mimic,
\par of the normal treatment of the hated, disdained, and conquered enemy,
\par who is not only deprived of every right and protection but of every
\par mercy; so we have the martial law and triumphant festival of the _v\'e6
\par victis_! in all its mercilessness and cruelty. This shows why war
\par itself (counting the sacrificial cult of war) has produced all the
\par forms under which punishment has manifested itself in history.
\par 
\par 
\par 10.
\par 
\par As it grows more powerful, the community tends to take the offences of
\par the individual less seriously, because they are now regarded as being
\par much less revolutionary and dangerous to the corporate existence: the
\par evil-doer is no more outlawed and put outside the pale, the common
\par wrath can no longer vent itself upon him with its old licence,--on
\par the contrary, from this very time it is against this wrath, and
\par particularly against the wrath of those directly injured, that the
\par evil-doer is carefully shielded and protected by the community. As, in
\par fact, the penal law develops, the following characteristics become
\par more and more clearly marked: compromise with the wrath of those
\par directly affected by the misdeed; a consequent endeavour to localise
\par the matter and to prevent a further, or indeed a general spread of
\par the disturbance; attempts to find equivalents and to settle the whole
\par matter (compositio); above all, the will, which manifests itself with
\par increasing definiteness, to treat every offence as in a certain degree
\par capable of _being paid off_, and consequently, at any rate up to a
\par certain point, to _isolate_ the offender from his act. As the power and
\par the self-consciousness of a community increases, so proportionately
\par does the penal law become mitigated; conversely every weakening and
\par jeopardising of the community revives the harshest forms of that law.
\par The creditor has always grown more humane proportionately as he has
\par grown more rich; finally the amount of injury he can endure without
\par really suffering becomes the criterion of his wealth. It is possible
\par to conceive of a society blessed with so great a _consciousness of its
\par own power_ as to indulge in the most aristocratic luxury of letting
\par its wrong-doers go _scot-free_.--"What do my parasites matter to me?"
\par might society say. "Let them live and flourish! I am strong enough for
\par it."--The justice which began with the maxim, "Everything can be paid
\par off, everything must be paid off," ends with connivance at the escape
\par of those who cannot pay to escape--it ends, like every good thing on
\par earth, by _destroying itself_.--The self-destruction of Justice! we
\par know the pretty name it calls itself--_Grace!_ it remains, as is
\par obvious, the privilege of the strongest, better still, their super-law.
\par 
\par 
\par 11.
\par 
\par A deprecatory word here against the attempts, that have lately been
\par made, to find the origin of justice on quite another basis--namely,
\par on that of _resentment_. Let me whisper a word in the ear of the
\par psychologists, if they would fain study revenge itself at close
\par quarters: this plant blooms its prettiest at present among Anarchists
\par and anti-Semites, a hidden flower, as it has ever been, like the
\par violet, though, forsooth, with another perfume. And as like must
\par necessarily emanate from like, it will not be a matter for surprise
\par that it is just in such circles that we see the birth of endeavours (it
\par is their old birthplace--compare above, First Essay, paragraph 14),
\par to sanctify _revenge_ under the name of _justice_ (as though Justice
\par were at bottom merely a _development_ of the consciousness of injury),
\par and thus with the rehabilitation of revenge to reinstate generally
\par and collectively all the _reactive_ emotions. I object to this last
\par point least of all. It even seems _meritorious_ when regarded from the
\par standpoint of the whole problem of biology (from which standpoint the
\par value of these emotions has up to the present been underestimated).
\par And that to which I alone call attention, is the circumstance that
\par it is the spirit of revenge itself, from which develops this new
\par nuance of scientific equity (for the benefit of hate, envy, mistrust,
\par jealousy, suspicion, rancour, revenge). This scientific "equity"
\par stops immediately and makes way for the accents of deadly enmity and
\par prejudice, so soon as another group of emotions comes on the scene,
\par which in my opinion are of a much higher biological value than these
\par reactions, and consequently have a paramount claim to the valuation
\par and appreciation of science: I mean the really _active_ emotions, such
\par as personal and material ambition, and so forth. (E. D\'fchring, _Value
\par of Life; Course of Philosophy_, and _passim_.) So much against this
\par tendency in general: but as for the particular maxim of D\'fchring's,
\par that the home of Justice is to be found in the sphere of the reactive
\par feelings, our love of truth compels us drastically to invert his own
\par proposition and to oppose to him this other maxim: the _last_ sphere
\par conquered by the spirit of justice is the sphere of the feeling of
\par reaction! When it really comes about that the just man remains just
\par even as regards his injurer (and not merely cold, moderate, reserved,
\par indifferent: being just is always a _positive_ state); when, in spite
\par of the strong provocation of personal insult, contempt, and calumny,
\par the lofty and clear objectivity of the just and judging eye (whose
\par glance is as profound as it is gentle) is untroubled, why then we have
\par a piece of perfection, a past master of the world--something, in fact,
\par which it would not be wise to expect, and which should not at any
\par rate be too easily _believed_. Speaking generally, there is no doubt
\par but that even the justest individual only requires a little dose of
\par hostility, malice, or innuendo to drive the blood into his brain and
\par the fairness _from_ it. The active man, the attacking, aggressive man
\par is always a hundred degrees nearer to justice than the man who merely
\par reacts; he certainly has no need to adopt the tactics, necessary in the
\par case of the reacting man, of making false and biassed valuations of his
\par object. It is, in point of fact, for this reason that the aggressive
\par man has at all times enjoyed the stronger, bolder, more aristocratic,
\par and also _freer_ outlook, the _better_ conscience. On the other hand,
\par we already surmise who it really is that has on his conscience the
\par invention of the "bad conscience,"--the resentful man! Finally, let man
\par look at himself in history. In what sphere up to the present has the
\par whole administration of law, the actual need of law, found its earthly
\par home? Perchance in the sphere of the reacting man? Not for a minute:
\par rather in that of the active, strong, spontaneous, aggressive man? I
\par deliberately defy the above-mentioned agitator (who himself makes this
\par self-confession, "the creed of revenge has run through all my works
\par and endeavours like the red thread of Justice"), and say, that judged
\par historically law in the world represents the very war _against_ the
\par reactive feelings, the very war waged on those feelings by the powers
\par of activity and aggression, which devote some of their strength to
\par damming and keeping within bounds this effervescence of hysterical
\par reactivity, and to forcing it to some compromise. Everywhere where
\par justice is practised and justice is maintained, it is to be observed
\par that the stronger power, when confronted with the weaker powers which
\par are inferior to it (whether they be groups, or individuals), searches
\par for weapons to put an end to the senseless fury of resentment, while
\par it carries on its object, partly by taking the victim of resentment
\par out of the clutches of revenge, partly by substituting for revenge a
\par campaign of its own against the enemies of peace and order, partly
\par by finding, suggesting, and occasionally enforcing settlements,
\par partly by standardising certain equivalents for injuries, to which
\par equivalents the element of resentment is henceforth finally referred.
\par The most drastic measure, however, taken and effectuated by the supreme
\par power, to combat the preponderance of the feelings of spite and
\par vindictiveness--it takes this measure as soon as it is at all strong
\par enough to do so--is the foundation of _law_, the imperative declaration
\par of what in its eyes is to be regarded as just and lawful, and what
\par unjust and unlawful: and while, after the foundation of law, the
\par supreme power treats the aggressive and arbitrary acts of individuals,
\par or of whole groups, as a violation of law, and a revolt against
\par itself, it distracts the feelings of its subjects from the immediate
\par injury inflicted by such a violation, and thus eventually attains the
\par very opposite result to that always desired by revenge, which sees
\par and recognises nothing but the standpoint of the injured party. From
\par henceforth the eye becomes trained to a more and more _impersonal_
\par valuation of the deed, even the eye of the injured party himself
\par (though this is in the final stage of all, as has been previously
\par remarked)--on this principle "right" and "wrong" first manifest
\par themselves after the foundation of law (and not, as D\'fchring maintains,
\par only after the act of violation). To talk of intrinsic right and
\par intrinsic wrong is absolutely non-sensical; intrinsically, an injury,
\par an oppression, an exploitation, an annihilation can be nothing wrong,
\par inasmuch as life is _essentially_ (that is, in its cardinal functions)
\par something which functions by injuring, oppressing, exploiting, and
\par annihilating, and is absolutely inconceivable without such a character.
\par It is necessary to make an even more serious confession:--viewed from
\par the most advanced biological standpoint, conditions of legality can be
\par only _exceptional conditions_, in that they are partial restrictions
\par of the real life-will, which makes for power, and in that they are
\par subordinated to the life-will's general end as particular means,
\par that is, as means to create _larger_ units of strength. A legal
\par organisation, conceived of as sovereign and universal, not as a weapon
\par in a fight of complexes of power, but as a weapon _against_ fighting,
\par generally something after the style of D\'fchring's communistic model
\par of treating every will as equal with every other will, would be a
\par principle _hostile to life_, a destroyer and dissolver of man, an
\par outrage on the future of man, a symptom of fatigue, a secret cut to
\par Nothingness.--
\par 
\par 
\par 12.
\par 
\par A word more on the origin and end of punishment--two problems which
\par are or ought to be kept distinct, but which unfortunately are usually
\par lumped into one. And what tactics have our moral genealogists employed
\par up to the present in these cases? Their inveterate na\'efvet\'e9. They find
\par out some "end" in the punishment, for instance, revenge and deterrence,
\par and then in all their innocence set this end at the beginning, as the
\par _causa fiendi_ of the punishment, and--they have done the trick. But
\par the patching up of a history of the origin of law is the last use to
\par which the "End in Law"[4] ought to be put. Perhaps there is no more
\par pregnant principle for any kind of history than the following, which,
\par difficult though it is to master, _should_ none the less be _mastered_
\par in every detail.--The origin of the existence of a thing and its final
\par utility, its practical application and incorporation in a system of
\par ends, are _toto c\'9clo_ opposed to each other--everything, anything,
\par which exists and which prevails anywhere, will always be put to new
\par purposes by a force superior to itself, will be commandeered afresh,
\par will be turned and transformed to new uses; all "happening" in the
\par organic world consists of _overpowering_ and dominating, and again all
\par overpowering and domination is a new interpretation and adjustment,
\par which must necessarily obscure or absolutely extinguish the subsisting
\par "meaning" and "end." The most perfect comprehension of the utility
\par of any physiological organ (or also of a legal institution, social
\par custom, political habit, form in art or in religious worship) does not
\par for a minute imply any simultaneous comprehension of its origin: this
\par may seem uncomfortable and unpalatable to the older men,--for it has
\par been the immemorial belief that understanding the final cause or the
\par utility of a thing, a form, an institution, means also understanding
\par the reason for its origin: to give an example of this logic, the eye
\par was made to see, the hand was made to grasp. So even punishment was
\par conceived as invented with a view to punishing. But all ends and all
\par utilities are only _signs_ that a Will to Power has mastered a less
\par powerful force, has impressed thereon out of its own self the meaning
\par of a function; and the whole history of a "Thing," an organ, a custom,
\par can on the same principle be regarded as a continuous "sign-chain"
\par of perpetually new interpretations and adjustments, whose causes, so
\par far from needing to have even a mutual connection, sometimes follow
\par and alternate with each other absolutely haphazard. Similarly, the
\par evolution of a "thing," of a custom, is anything but its _progressus_
\par to an end, still less a logical and direct _progressus_ attained
\par with the minimum expenditure of energy and cost: it is rather the
\par succession of processes of subjugation, more or less profound, more
\par or less mutually independent, which operate on the thing itself; it
\par is, further, the resistance which in each case invariably displayed
\par this subjugation, the Protean wriggles by way of defence and reaction,
\par and, further, the results of successful counter-efforts. The form is
\par fluid, but the meaning is even more so--even inside every individual
\par organism the case is the same: with every genuine growth of the whole,
\par the "function" of the individual organs becomes shifted,--in certain
\par cases a partial perishing of these organs, a diminution of their
\par numbers (for instance, through annihilation of the connecting members),
\par can be a symptom of growing strength and perfection. What I mean is
\par this: even partial _loss of utility_, decay, and degeneration, loss of
\par function and purpose, in a word, death, appertain to the conditions
\par of the genuine _progressus_; which always appears in the shape of
\par a will and way to _greater_ power, and is always realised at the
\par expense of innumerable smaller powers. The magnitude of a "progress"
\par is gauged by the greatness of the sacrifice that it requires: humanity
\par as a mass sacrificed to the prosperity of the one _stronger_ species
\par of Man--that _would be_ a progress. I emphasise all the more this
\par cardinal characteristic of the historic method, for the reason that in
\par its essence it runs counter to predominant instincts and prevailing
\par taste, which much prefer to put up with absolute casualness, even with
\par the mechanical senselessness of all phenomena, than with the theory
\par of a power-will, in exhaustive play throughout all phenomena. The
\par democratic idiosyncrasy against everything which rules and wishes to
\par rule, the modern _misarchism_ (to coin a bad word for a bad thing),
\par has gradually but so thoroughly transformed itself into the guise of
\par intellectualism, the most abstract intellectualism, that even nowadays
\par it penetrates and _has the right_ to penetrate step by step into the
\par most exact and apparently the most objective sciences: this tendency
\par has, in fact, in my view already dominated the whole of physiology
\par and biology, and to their detriment, as is obvious, in so far as
\par it has spirited away a radical idea, the idea of true _activity_.
\par The tyranny of this idiosyncrasy, however, results in the theory
\par of "adaptation" being pushed forward into the van of the argument,
\par exploited; adaptation--that means to say, a second-class activity, a
\par mere capacity for "reacting"; in fact, life itself has been defined
\par (by Herbert Spencer) as an increasingly effective internal adaptation
\par to external circumstances. This definition, however, fails to realise
\par the real essence of life, its will to power. It fails to appreciate the
\par paramount superiority enjoyed by those plastic forces of spontaneity,
\par aggression, and encroachment with their new interpretations and
\par tendencies, to the operation of which adaptation is only a natural
\par corollary: consequently the sovereign office of the highest
\par functionaries in the organism itself (among which the life-will appears
\par as an active and formative principle) is repudiated. One remembers
\par Huxley's reproach to Spencer of his "administrative Nihilism": but it
\par is a case of something much _more_ than "administration."
\par 
\par 
\par 13.
\par 
\par To return to our subject, namely _punishment_, we must make
\par consequently a double distinction: first, the relatively permanent
\par _element_, the custom, the act, the "drama," a certain rigid sequence
\par of methods of procedure; on the other hand, the fluid element, the
\par meaning, the end, the expectation which is attached to the operation of
\par such procedure. At this point we immediately assume, _per analogiam_
\par (in accordance with the theory of the historic method, which we have
\par elaborated above), that the procedure itself is something older and
\par earlier than its utilisation in punishment, that this utilisation was
\par _introduced_ and interpreted into the procedure (which had existed
\par for a long time, but whose employment had another meaning), in short,
\par that the case is _different_ from that hitherto supposed by our _na\'eff_
\par genealogists of morals and of law, who thought that the procedure was
\par _invented_ for the purpose of punishment, in the same way that the hand
\par had been previously thought to have been invented for the purpose of
\par grasping. With regard to the other element in _punishment_, its fluid
\par element, its meaning, the idea of punishment in a very late stage of
\par civilisation (for instance, contemporary Europe) is not content with
\par manifesting merely one meaning, but manifests a whole synthesis "of
\par meanings." The past general history of punishment, the history of its
\par employment for the most diverse ends, crystallises eventually into
\par a kind of unity, which is difficult to analyse into its parts, and
\par which, it is necessary to emphasise, absolutely defies definition.
\par (It is nowadays impossible to say definitely _the precise reason_
\par for punishment: all ideas, in which a whole process is promiscuously
\par comprehended, elude definition; it is only that which has no history,
\par which can be defined.) At an earlier stage, on the contrary, that
\par synthesis of meanings appears much less rigid and much more elastic; we
\par can realise how in each individual case the elements of the synthesis
\par change their value and their position, so that now one element and
\par now another stands out and predominates over the others, nay, in
\par certain cases one element (perhaps the end of deterrence) seems to
\par eliminate all the rest. At any rate, so as to give some idea of the
\par uncertain, supplementary, and accidental nature of the meaning of
\par punishment and of the manner in which one identical procedure can
\par be employed and adapted for the most diametrically opposed objects,
\par I will at this point give a scheme that has suggested itself to
\par me, a scheme itself based on comparatively small and accidental
\par material.--Punishment, as rendering the criminal harmless and incapable
\par of further injury.--Punishment, as compensation for the injury
\par sustained by the injured party, in any form whatsoever (including
\par the form of sentimental compensation).--Punishment, as an isolation
\par of that which disturbs the equilibrium, so as to prevent the further
\par spreading of the disturbance.--Punishment as a means of inspiring
\par fear of those who determine and execute the punishment.--Punishment
\par as a kind of compensation for advantages which the wrong-doer has
\par up to that time enjoyed (for example, when he is utilised as a
\par slave in the mines).--Punishment, as the elimination of an element
\par of decay (sometimes of a whole branch, as according to the Chinese
\par laws, consequently as a means to the purification of the race, or
\par the preservation of a social type).---Punishment as a festival, as
\par the violent oppression and humiliation of an enemy that has at last
\par been subdued.--Punishment as a mnemonic, whether for him who suffers
\par the punishment--the so-called "correction," or for the witnesses of
\par its administration. Punishment, as the payment of a fee stipulated
\par for by the power which protects the evil-doer from the excesses of
\par revenge.--Punishment, as a compromise with the natural phenomenon
\par of revenge, in so far as revenge is still maintained and claimed
\par as a privilege by the stronger races.--Punishment as a declaration
\par and measure of war against an enemy of peace, of law, of order,
\par of authority, who is fought by society with the weapons which war
\par provides, as a spirit dangerous to the community, as a breaker of the
\par contract on which the community is based, as a rebel, a traitor, and a
\par breaker of the peace.
\par 
\par 
\par 14.
\par 
\par This list is certainly not complete; it is obvious that punishment
\par is overloaded with utilities of all kinds. This makes it all the
\par more permissible to eliminate one supposed utility, which passes, at
\par any rate in the popular mind, for its most essential utility, and
\par which is just what even now provides the strongest support for that
\par faith in punishment which is nowadays for many reasons tottering.
\par Punishment is supposed to have the value of exciting in the guilty
\par the consciousness of guilt; in punishment is sought the proper
\par instrumentum of that psychic reaction which becomes known as a "bad
\par conscience," "remorse." But this theory is even, from the point of
\par view of the present, a violation of reality and psychology: and how
\par much more so is the case when we have to deal with the longest period
\par of man's history, his primitive history! Genuine remorse is certainly
\par extremely rare among wrong-doers and the victims of punishment; prisons
\par and houses of correction are not _the_ soil on which this worm of
\par remorse pullulates for choice--this is the unanimous opinion of all
\par conscientious observers, who in many cases arrive at such a judgment
\par with enough reluctance and against their own personal wishes. Speaking
\par generally, punishment hardens and numbs, it produces concentration, it
\par sharpens the consciousness of alienation, it strengthens the power of
\par resistance. When it happens that it breaks the man's energy and brings
\par about a piteous prostration and abjectness, such a result is certainly
\par even less salutary than the average effect of punishment, which is
\par characterised by a harsh and sinister doggedness. The thought of those
\par _prehistoric_ millennia brings us to the unhesitating conclusion,
\par that it was simply through punishment that the evolution of the
\par consciousness of guilt was most forcibly retarded--at any rate in the
\par victims of the punishing power. In particular, let us not underestimate
\par the extent to which, by the very sight of the judicial and executive
\par procedure, the wrong-doer is himself prevented from feeling that his
\par deed, the character of his act, is _intrinsically_ reprehensible: for
\par he sees clearly the same kind of acts practised in the service of
\par justice, and then called good, and practised with a good conscience;
\par acts such as espionage, trickery, bribery, trapping, the whole
\par intriguing and insidious art of the policeman and the informer--the
\par whole system, in fact, manifested in the different kinds of punishment
\par (a system not excused by passion, but based on principle), of robbing,
\par oppressing, insulting, imprisoning, racking, murdering.--All this
\par he sees treated by his judges, not as acts meriting censure and
\par condemnation _in themselves_, but only in a particular context and
\par application. It was not on this soil that grew the "bad conscience,"
\par that most sinister and interesting plant of our earthly vegetation--
\par in point of fact, throughout a most lengthy period, no suggestion of
\par having to do with a "guilty man" manifested itself in the consciousness
\par of the man who judged and punished. One had merely to deal with an
\par author of an injury, an irresponsible piece of fate. And the man
\par himself, on whom the punishment subsequently fell like a piece of fate,
\par was occasioned no more of an "inner pain" than would be occasioned by
\par the sudden approach of some uncalculated event, some terrible natural
\par catastrophe, a rushing, crushing avalanche against which there is no
\par resistance.
\par 
\par 
\par 15.
\par 
\par This truth came insidiously enough to the consciousness of Spinoza (to
\par the disgust of his commentators, who (like Kuno Fischer, for instance)
\par give themselves no end of _trouble_ to misunderstand him on this
\par point), when one afternoon (as he sat raking up who knows what memory)
\par he indulged in the question of what was really left for him personally
\par of the celebrated _morsus conscienti\'e6_--Spinoza, who had relegated
\par "good and evil" to the sphere of human imagination, and indignantly
\par defended the honour of his "free" God against those blasphemers who
\par affirmed that God did everything _sub ratione boni_ ("but this was
\par tantamount to subordinating God to fate, and would really be the
\par greatest of all absurdities"). For Spinoza the world had returned
\par again to that innocence in which it lay before the discovery of the
\par bad conscience: what, then, had happened to the _morsus conscienti\'e6_?
\par "The antithesis of _gaudium_," said he at last to himself,--"A sadness
\par accompanied by the recollection of a past event which has turned out
\par contrary to all expectation" (_Eth_. III., Propos. XVIII. Schol.
\par i. ii.). Evil-doers have throughout thousands of years felt when
\par overtaken by punishment _exactly like Spinoza_, on the subject of
\par their "offence": "here is something which went wrong contrary to my
\par anticipation," not "I ought not to have done this."--They submitted
\par themselves to punishment, just as one submits one's self to a disease,
\par to a misfortune, or to death, with that stubborn and resigned fatalism
\par which gives the Russians, for instance, even nowadays, the advantage
\par over us Westerners, in the handling of life. If at that period there
\par was a critique of action, the criterion was prudence: the real _effect_
\par of punishment is unquestionably chiefly to be found in a sharpening
\par of the sense of prudence, in a lengthening of the memory, in a will
\par to adopt more of a policy of caution, suspicion, and secrecy; in the
\par recognition that there are many things which are unquestionably beyond
\par one's capacity; in a kind of improvement in self-criticism. The broad
\par effects which can be obtained by punishment in man and beast, are the
\par increase of fear, the sharpening of the sense of cunning, the mastery
\par of the desires: so it is that punishment _tames_ man, but does not make
\par him "better"--it would be more correct even to go so far as to assert
\par the contrary ("Injury makes a man cunning," says a popular proverb: so
\par far as it makes him cunning, it makes him also bad. Fortunately, it
\par often enough makes him stupid).
\par 
\par 
\par 16.
\par 
\par At this juncture I cannot avoid trying to give a tentative and
\par provisional expression to my own hypothesis concerning the origin of
\par the bad conscience: it is difficult to make it fully appreciated,
\par and it requires continuous meditation, attention, and digestion. I
\par regard the bad conscience as the serious illness which man was bound
\par to contract under the stress of the most radical change which he has
\par ever experienced--that change, when he found himself finally imprisoned
\par within the pale of society and of peace.
\par 
\par Just like the plight of the water-animals, when they were compelled
\par either to become land-animals or to perish, so was the plight of these
\par half-animals, perfectly adapted as they were to the savage life of war,
\par prowling, and adventure--suddenly all their instincts were rendered
\par worthless and "switched off." Henceforward they had to walk on their
\par feet--"carry themselves," whereas heretofore they had been carried by
\par the water: a terrible heaviness oppressed them. They found themselves
\par clumsy in obeying the simplest directions, confronted with this new
\par and unknown world they had no longer their old guides--the regulative
\par instincts that had led them unconsciously to safety--they were reduced,
\par were those unhappy creatures, to thinking, inferring, calculating,
\par putting together causes and results, reduced to that poorest and most
\par erratic organ of theirs, their "consciousness." I do not believe
\par there was ever in the world such a feeling of misery, such a leaden
\par discomfort--further, those old instincts had not immediately ceased
\par their demands! Only it was difficult and rarely possible to gratify
\par them: speaking broadly, they were compelled to satisfy themselves by
\par new and, as it were, hole-and-corner methods. All instincts which
\par do not find a vent without, _turn inwards_--this is what I mean by
\par the growing "internalisation" of man: consequently we have the first
\par growth in man, of what subsequently was called his soul. The whole
\par inner world, originally as thin as if it had been stretched between
\par two layers of skin, burst apart and expanded proportionately, and
\par obtained depth, breadth, and height, when man's external outlet
\par became _obstructed_. These terrible bulwarks, with which the social
\par organisation protected itself against the old instincts of freedom
\par (punishments belong pre-eminently to these bulwarks), brought it
\par about that all those instincts of wild, free, prowling man became
\par turned backwards against man himself. Enmity, cruelty, the delight
\par in persecution, in surprises, change, destruction--the turning all
\par these instincts against their own possessors: this is the origin of
\par the "bad conscience." It was man, who, lacking external enemies and
\par obstacles, and imprisoned as he was in the oppressive narrowness and
\par monotony of custom, in his own impatience lacerated, persecuted,
\par gnawed, frightened, and ill-treated himself; it was this animal in the
\par hands of the tamer, which beat itself against the bars of its cage; it
\par was this being who, pining and yearning for that desert home of which
\par it had been deprived, was compelled to create out of its own self, an
\par adventure, a torture-chamber, a hazardous and perilous desert--it was
\par this fool, this homesick and desperate prisoner--who invented the "bad
\par conscience." But thereby he introduced that most grave and sinister
\par illness, from which mankind has not yet recovered, the suffering of
\par man from the disease called man, as the result of a violent breaking
\par from his animal past, the result, as it were, of a spasmodic plunge
\par into a new environment and new conditions of existence, the result of
\par a declaration of war against the old instincts, which up to that time
\par had been the staple of his power, his joy, his formidableness. Let
\par us immediately add that this fact of an animal ego turning against
\par itself, taking part against itself, produced in the world so novel,
\par profound, unheard-of, problematic, inconsistent, and _pregnant_ a
\par phenomenon, that the aspect of the world was radically altered thereby.
\par In sooth, only divine spectators could have appreciated the drama
\par that then began, and whose end baffles conjecture as yet--a drama too
\par subtle, too wonderful, too paradoxical to warrant its undergoing a
\par non-sensical and unheeded performance on some random grotesque planet!
\par Henceforth man is to be counted as one of the most unexpected and
\par sensational lucky shots in the game of the "big baby" of Heracleitus,
\par whether he be called Zeus or Chance--he awakens on his behalf the
\par interest, excitement, hope, almost the confidence, of his being the
\par harbinger and forerunner of something, of man being no end, but only a
\par stage, an interlude, a bridge, a great promise.
\par 
\par 
\par 17.
\par 
\par It is primarily involved in this hypothesis of the origin of the bad
\par conscience, that that alteration was no gradual and no voluntary
\par alteration, and that it did not manifest itself as an organic
\par adaptation to new conditions, but as a break, a jump, a necessity, an
\par inevitable fate, against which there was no resistance and never a
\par spark of resentment. And secondarily, that the fitting of a hitherto
\par unchecked and amorphous population into a fixed form, starting as
\par it had done in an act of violence, could only be accomplished by
\par acts of violence and nothing else--that the oldest "State" appeared
\par consequently as a ghastly tyranny, a grinding ruthless piece of
\par machinery, which went on working, till this raw material of a
\par semi-animal populace was not only thoroughly kneaded and elastic, but
\par also _moulded_. I used the word "State": my meaning is self-evident,
\par namely, a herd of blonde beasts of prey, a race of conquerors and
\par masters, which with all its warlike organisation and all its organising
\par power pounces with its terrible claws on a population, in numbers
\par possibly tremendously superior, but as yet formless, as yet nomad.
\par Such is the origin of the "State." That fantastic theory that makes it
\par begin with a contract is, I think, disposed of. He who can command,
\par he who is a master by "nature," he who comes on the scene forceful
\par in deed and gesture--what has he to do with contracts? Such beings
\par defy calculation, they come like fate, without cause, reason, notice,
\par excuse, they are there like the lightning is there, too terrible, too
\par sudden, too convincing, too "different," to be personally even hated.
\par Their work is an instinctive creating and impressing of forms, they
\par are the most involuntary, unconscious artists that there are:--their
\par appearance produces instantaneously a scheme of sovereignty which is
\par live, in which the functions are partitioned and apportioned, in which
\par above all no part is received or finds a place, until pregnant with
\par a "meaning" in regard to the whole. They are ignorant of the meaning
\par of guilt, responsibility, consideration, are these born organisers;
\par in them predominates that terrible artist-egoism, that gleams like
\par brass, and that knows itself justified to all eternity, in its work,
\par even as a mother in her child. It is not in _them_ that there grew
\par the bad conscience, that is elementary--but it would not have grown
\par _without_ them, repulsive growth as it was, it would be missing, had
\par not a tremendous quantity of freedom been expelled from the world by
\par the stress of their hammer-strokes, their artist violence, or been at
\par any rate made invisible and, as it were, _latent_. This _instinct of
\par freedom_ forced into being latent--it is already clear--this instinct
\par of freedom forced back, trodden back, imprisoned within itself, and
\par finally only able to find vent and relief in itself; this, only this,
\par is the beginning of the "bad conscience."
\par 
\par 
\par 18.
\par 
\par Beware of thinking lightly of this phenomenon, by reason of its initial
\par painful ugliness. At bottom it is the same active force which is at
\par work on a more grandiose scale in those potent artists and organisers,
\par and builds states, which here, internally, on a smaller and pettier
\par scale and with a retrogressive tendency, makes itself a bad science in
\par the "labyrinth of the breast," to use Goethe's phrase, and which builds
\par negative ideals; it is, I repeat, that identical _instinct of freedom_
\par (to use my own language, the will to power): only the material, on
\par which this force with all its constructive and tyrannous nature is
\par let loose, is here man himself, his whole old animal self--and not as
\par in the case of that more grandiose and sensational phenomenon, the
\par _other_ man, _other_ men. This secret self-tyranny, this cruelty of
\par the artist, this delight in giving a form to one's self as a piece of
\par difficult, refractory, and suffering material, in burning in a will, a
\par critique, a contradiction, a contempt, a negation; this sinister and
\par ghastly labour of love on the part of a soul, whose will is cloven
\par in two within itself, which makes itself suffer from delight in the
\par infliction of suffering; this wholly _active_ bad conscience has
\par finally (as one already anticipates)--true fountainhead as it is of
\par idealism and imagination--produced an abundance of novel and amazing
\par beauty and affirmation, and perhaps has really been the first to
\par give birth to beauty at all. What would beauty be, forsooth, if its
\par contradiction had not first been presented to consciousness, if the
\par ugly had not first said to itself, "I am ugly"? At any rate, after this
\par hint the problem of how far idealism and beauty can be traced in such
\par opposite ideas as "_selflessness_," _self-denial_, _self-sacrifice_,
\par becomes less problematical; and indubitably in future we shall
\par certainly know the real and original character of the _delight_
\par experienced by the self-less, the self-denying, the self-sacrificing:
\par this delight is a phase of cruelty.--So much provisionally for the
\par origin of "altruism" as a _moral_ value, and the marking out the ground
\par from which this value has grown: it is only the bad conscience, only
\par the will for self-abuse, that provides the necessary conditions for the
\par existence of altruism as a _value_.
\par 
\par 
\par 19.
\par 
\par Undoubtedly the bad conscience is an illness, but an illness like
\par pregnancy is an illness. If we search out the conditions under which
\par this illness reaches its most terrible and sublime zenith, we shall see
\par what really first brought about its entry into the world. But to do
\par this we must take a long breath, and we must first of all go back once
\par again to an earlier point of view. The relation at civil law of the
\par ower to his creditor (which has already been discussed in detail), has
\par been interpreted once again (and indeed in a manner which historically
\par is exceedingly remarkable and suspicious) into a relationship, which
\par is perhaps more incomprehensible to us moderns than to any other era;
\par that is, into the relationship of the _existing_ generation to its
\par _ancestors_. Within the original tribal association--we are talking of
\par primitive times--each living generation recognises a legal obligation
\par towards the earlier generation, and particularly towards the earliest,
\par which founded the family (and this is something much more than a mere
\par sentimental obligation, the existence of which, during the longest
\par period of man's history, is by no means indisputable). There prevails
\par in them the conviction that it is only thanks to sacrifices and efforts
\par of their ancestors, that the race _persists_ at all--and that this
\par has to be _paid back_ to them by sacrifices and services. Thus is
\par recognised the _owing_ of a debt, which accumulates continually by
\par reason of these ancestors never ceasing in their subsequent life as
\par potent spirits to secure by their power new privileges and advantages
\par to the race. Gratis, perchance? But there is no gratis for that raw
\par and "mean-souled" age. What return can be made?--Sacrifice (at first,
\par nourishment, in its crudest sense), festivals, temples, tributes of
\par veneration, above all, obedience--since all customs are, _qu\'e2_ works of
\par the ancestors, equally their precepts and commands--are the ancestors
\par ever given enough? This suspicion remains and grows: from time to time
\par it extorts a great wholesale ransom, something monstrous in the way of
\par repayment of the creditor (the notorious sacrifice of the first-born,
\par for example, blood, human blood in any case). The _fear_ of ancestors
\par and their power, the consciousness of owing debts to them, necessarily
\par increases, according to this kind of logic, in the exact proportion
\par that the race itself increases, that the race itself becomes more
\par victorious, more independent, more honoured, more feared. This, and not
\par the contrary, is the fact. Each step towards race decay, all disastrous
\par events, all symptoms of degeneration, of approaching disintegration,
\par always _diminish_ the fear of the founders' spirit, and whittle away
\par the idea of his sagacity, providence, and potent presence. Conceive
\par this crude kind of logic carried to its climax: it follows that the
\par ancestors of the _most powerful_ races must, through the growing fear
\par that they exercise on the imaginations, grow themselves into monstrous
\par dimensions, and become relegated to the gloom of a divine mystery that
\par transcends imagination--the ancestor becomes at last necessarily
\par transfigured into a _god_. Perhaps this is the very origin of the gods,
\par that is, an origin from _fear_! And those who feel bound to add, "but
\par from piety also," will have difficulty in maintaining this theory,
\par with regard to the primeval and longest period of the human race. And
\par of course this is even more the case as regards the _middle_ period,
\par the formative period of the aristocratic races--the aristocratic
\par races which have given back with interest to their founders, the
\par ancestors (heroes, gods), all those qualities which in the meanwhile
\par have appeared in themselves, that is, the aristocratic qualities. We
\par will later on glance again at the ennobling and promotion of the gods
\par (which of course is totally distinct from their "sanctification"): let
\par us now provisionally follow to its end the course of the whole of this
\par development of the consciousness of "owing."
\par 
\par 
\par 20.
\par 
\par According to the teaching of history, the consciousness of owing
\par debts to the deity by no means came to an end with the decay of the
\par clan organisation of society; just as mankind has inherited the
\par ideas of "good" and "bad" from the race-nobility (together with its
\par fundamental tendency towards establishing social distinctions), so
\par with the heritage of the racial and tribal gods it has also inherited
\par the incubus of debts as yet unpaid and the desire to discharge them.
\par The transition is effected by those large populations of slaves and
\par bondsmen, who, whether through compulsion or through submission and
\par "_mimicry,_" have accommodated themselves to the religion of their
\par masters; through this channel these inherited tendencies inundate
\par the world. The feeling of owing a debt to the deity has grown
\par continuously for several centuries, always in the same proportion in
\par which the idea of God and the consciousness of God have grown and
\par become exalted among mankind. (The whole history of ethnic fights,
\par victories, reconciliations, amalgamations, everything, in fact, which
\par precedes the eventual classing of all the social elements in each great
\par race-synthesis, are mirrored in the hotch-potch genealogy of their
\par gods, in the legends of their fights, victories, and reconciliations.
\par Progress towards universal empires invariably means progress towards
\par universal deities; despotism, with its subjugation of the independent
\par nobility, always paves the way for some system or other of monotheism.)
\par The appearance of the Christian god, as the record god up to this time,
\par has for that very reason brought equally into the world the record
\par amount of guilt consciousness. Granted that we have gradually started
\par on the _reverse_ movement, there is no little probability in the
\par deduction, based on the continuous decay in the belief in the Christian
\par god, to the effect that there also already exists a considerable
\par decay in the human consciousness of owing (ought); in fact, we cannot
\par shut our eyes to the prospect of the complete and eventual triumph of
\par atheism freeing mankind from all this feeling of obligation to their
\par origin, their _causa prima_. Atheism and a kind of second innocence
\par complement and supplement each other.
\par 
\par 
\par 21.
\par 
\par So much for my rough and preliminary sketch of the interrelation of
\par the ideas "ought" (owe) and "duty" with the postulates of religion. I
\par have intentionally shelved up to the present the actual moralisation
\par of these ideas (their being pushed back into the conscience, or more
\par precisely the interweaving of the _bad_ conscience with the idea of
\par God), and at the end of the last paragraph used language to the effect
\par that this moralisation did not exist, and that consequently these ideas
\par had necessarily come to an end, by reason of what had happened to their
\par hypothesis, the credence in our "creditor," in God. The actual facts
\par differ terribly from this theory. It is with the moralisation of the
\par ideas "ought" and "duty," and with their being pushed back into the
\par _bad_ conscience, that comes the first actual attempt to _reverse_ the
\par direction of the development we have just described, or at any rate
\par to arrest its evolution; it is just at this juncture that the very
\par hope of an eventual redemption _has to_ put itself once for all into
\par the prison of pessimism, it is at this juncture that the eye _has to_
\par recoil and rebound in despair from off an adamantine impossibility,
\par it is at this juncture that the ideas "guilt" and "duty" have to turn
\par backwards--turn backwards against _whom_? There is no doubt about
\par it; primarily against the "ower," in whom the bad conscience now
\par establishes itself, eats, extends, and grows like a polypus throughout
\par its length and breadth, all with such virulence, that at last, with
\par the impossibility of paying the debt, there becomes conceived the
\par idea of the impossibility of paying the penalty, the thought of its
\par inexpiability (the idea of "eternal punishment")--finally, too, it
\par turns against the "creditor," whether found in the _causa prima_ of
\par man, the origin of the human race, its sire, who henceforth becomes
\par burdened with a curse ("Adam," "original sin," "determination of the
\par will"), or in Nature from whose womb man springs, and on whom the
\par responsibility for the principle of evil is now cast ("Diabolisation of
\par Nature"), or in existence generally, on this logic an absolute _white
\par elephant_, with which mankind is landed (the Nihilistic flight from
\par life, the demand for Nothingness, or for the opposite of existence, for
\par some other existence, Buddhism and the like)--till suddenly we stand
\par before that paradoxical and awful expedient, through which a tortured
\par humanity has found a temporary alleviation, that stroke of genius
\par called Christianity:--God personally immolating himself for the debt of
\par man, God paying himself personally out of a pound of his own flesh, God
\par as the one being who can deliver man from what man had become unable to
\par deliver himself--the creditor playing scapegoat for his debtor, from
\par _love_ (can you believe it?), from love of his debtor!...
\par 
\par 
\par 22.
\par 
\par The reader will already have conjectured what took place on the stage
\par and behind the scenes of this drama. That will for self-torture, that
\par inverted cruelty of the animal man, who, turned subjective and scared
\par into introspection (encaged as he was in "the State," as part of his
\par taming process), invented the bad conscience so as to hurt himself,
\par after the _natural_ outlet for this will to hurt, became blocked--in
\par other words, this man of the bad conscience exploited the religious
\par hypothesis so as to carry his martyrdom to the ghastliest pitch of
\par agonised intensity. Owing something to _God_: this thought becomes his
\par instrument of torture. He apprehends in God the most extreme antitheses
\par that he can find to his own characteristic and ineradicable animal
\par instincts, he himself gives a new interpretation to these animal
\par instincts as being against what he "owes" to God (as enmity, rebellion,
\par and revolt against the "Lord," the "Father," the "Sire," the "Beginning
\par of the world"), he places himself between the horns of the dilemma,
\par "God" and "Devil." Every negation which he is inclined to utter to
\par himself, to the nature, naturalness, and reality of his being, he
\par whips into an ejaculation of "yes," uttering it as something existing,
\par living, efficient, as being God, as the holiness of God, the judgment
\par of God, as the hangmanship of God, as transcendence, as eternity, as
\par unending torment, as hell, as infinity of punishment and guilt. This is
\par a kind of madness of the will in the sphere of psychological cruelty
\par which is absolutely unparalleled:--man's _will_ to find himself guilty
\par and blameworthy to the point of inexpiability, his _will_ to think of
\par himself as punished, without the punishment ever being able to balance
\par the guilt, his _will_ to infect and to poison the fundamental basis
\par of the universe with the problem of punishment and guilt, in order to
\par cut off once and for all any escape out of this labyrinth of "fixed
\par ideas," his will for rearing an ideal--that of the "holy God"--face to
\par face with which he can have tangible proof of his own un-worthiness.
\par Alas for this mad melancholy beast man! What phantasies invade it,
\par what paroxysms of perversity, hysterical senselessness, and _mental
\par bestiality_ break out immediately, at the very slightest check on its
\par being the beast of action. All this is excessively interesting, but
\par at the same time tainted with a black, gloomy, enervating melancholy,
\par so that a forcible veto must be invoked against looking too long into
\par these abysses. Here is _disease_, undubitably, the most ghastly disease
\par that has as yet played havoc among men: and he who can still hear (but
\par man turns now deaf ears to such sounds), how in this night of torment
\par and nonsense there has rung out the cry of _love_, the cry of the most
\par passionate ecstasy, of redemption in _love_, he turns away gripped by
\par an invincible horror--in man there is so much that is ghastly--too long
\par has the world been a mad-house.
\par 
\par 
\par 23.
\par 
\par Let this suffice once for all concerning the origin of the "holy God."
\par The fact that _in itself_ the conception of gods is not bound to
\par lead necessarily to this degradation of the imagination (a temporary
\par representation of whose vagaries we felt bound give), the fact that
\par there exist nobler methods of utilising the invention of gods than in
\par this self-crucifixion and self-degradation of man, in which the last
\par two thousand years of Europe have been past masters--these facts can
\par fortunately be still perceived from every glance that we cast at the
\par Grecian gods, these mirrors of noble and grandiose men, in which the
\par _animal_ in man felt itself deified, and did _not_ devour itself in
\par subjective frenzy. These Greeks long utilised their gods as simple
\par buffers against the "bad conscience"--so that they could continue
\par to enjoy their freedom of soul: this, of course, is diametrically
\par opposed to Christianity's theory of its god. They went _very far_ on
\par this principle, did these splendid and lion-hearted children; and
\par there is no lesser authority than that of the Homeric Zeus for making
\par them realise occasionally that they are taking life too casually.
\par "Wonderful," says he on one occasion--it has to do with the case of
\par \'c6gistheus, a _very_ bad case indeed--
\par 
\par     "Wonderful how they grumble, the mortals against the immortals,
\par     _Only from us_, they presume, _comes evil_, but in their folly,
\par     Fashion they, spite of fate, the doom of their own disaster."
\par 
\par Yet the reader will note and observe that this Olympian spectator and
\par judge is far from being angry with them and thinking evil of them on
\par this score. "How _foolish_ they are," so thinks he of the misdeeds
\par of mortals--and "folly," "imprudence," "a little brain disturbance,"
\par and nothing more, are what the Greeks, even of the strongest, bravest
\par period, have admitted to be the ground of much that is evil and
\par fatal.--Folly, _not_ sin, do you understand?... But even this brain
\par disturbance was a problem--"Come, how is it even possible? How could it
\par have really got in brains like ours, the brains of men of aristocratic
\par ancestry, of men of fortune, of men of good natural endowments, of
\par men of the best society, of men of nobility and virtue?" This was the
\par question that for century on century the aristocratic Greek put to
\par himself when confronted with every (to him incomprehensible) outrage
\par and sacrilege with which one of his peers had polluted himself. "It
\par must be that a god had infatuated him," he would say at last, nodding
\par his head.--This solution is _typical_ of the Greeks, ... accordingly
\par the gods in those times subserved the functions of justifying man to a
\par certain extent even in evil--in those days they took upon themselves
\par not the punishment, but, what is more noble, the guilt.
\par 
\par 
\par 24.
\par 
\par I conclude with three queries, as you will see. "Is an ideal actually
\par set up here, or is one pulled down?" I am perhaps asked.... But have
\par ye sufficiently asked yourselves how dear a payment has the setting up
\par of every ideal in the world exacted? To achieve that consummation how
\par much truth must always be traduced and misunderstood, how many lies
\par must be sanctified, how much conscience has got to be disturbed, how
\par many pounds of "God" have got to be sacrificed every time? To enable
\par a sanctuary to be set up _a sanctuary has got to be destroyed_: that
\par is a law--show me an instance where it has not been fulfilled!...
\par We modern men, we inherit the immemorial tradition of vivisecting
\par the conscience, and practising cruelty to our animal selves. That is
\par the sphere of our most protracted training, perhaps of our artistic
\par prowess, at any rate of our dilettantism and our perverted taste. Man
\par has for too long regarded his natural proclivities with an "evil eye,"
\par so that eventually they have become in his system affiliated to a
\par bad conscience. A converse endeavour would be intrinsically feasible
\par --but who is strong enough to attempt it?--namely, to affiliate to
\par the "bad conscience" all those _unnatural_ proclivities, all those
\par transcendental aspirations, contrary to sense, instinct, nature, and
\par animalism--in short, all past and present ideals, which are all ideals
\par opposed to life, and traducing the world. To whom is one to turn
\par nowadays with _such_ hopes and pretensions?--It is just the _good_
\par men that we should thus bring about our ears; and in addition, as
\par stands to reason, the indolent, the hedgers, the vain, the hysterical,
\par the tired.... What is more offensive or more thoroughly calculated
\par to alienate, than giving any hint of the exalted severity with which
\par we treat ourselves? And again how conciliatory, how full of love
\par does all the world show itself towards us so soon as we do as all
\par the world docs, and "let ourselves go" like all the world. For such
\par a consummation we need spirits of _different_ calibre than seems
\par really feasible in this age; spirits rendered potent through wars and
\par victories, to whom conquest, adventure, danger, even pain, have become
\par a need; for such a consummation we need habituation to sharp, rare air,
\par to winter wanderings, to literal and metaphorical ice and mountains; we
\par even need a kind of sublime malice, a supreme and most self-conscious
\par insolence of knowledge, which is the appanage of great health; we need
\par (to summarise the awful truth) just this _great health_!
\par 
\par Is this even feasible to-day?... But some day, in a stronger age
\par than this rotting and introspective present, must he in sooth come
\par to us, even the _redeemer_ of great love and scorn, the creative
\par spirit, rebounding by the impetus of his own force back again away
\par from every transcendental plane and dimension, he whose solitude
\par is misunderstanded (sic) of the people, as though it were a flight
\par _from_ reality;--while actually it is only his diving, burrowing, and
\par penetrating _into_ reality, so that when he comes again to the light
\par he can at once bring about by these means the _redemption_ of this
\par reality; its redemption from the curse which the old ideal has laid
\par upon it. This man of the future, who in this wise will redeem us from
\par the old ideal, as he will from that ideal's necessary corollary of
\par great nausea, will to nothingness, and Nihilism; this tocsin of noon
\par and of the great verdict, which renders the will again free, who gives
\par back to the world its goal and to man his hope, this Antichrist and
\par Antinihilist, this conqueror of God and of Nothingness--_he must one
\par day come_.
\par 
\par 
\par 25.
\par 
\par But what am I talking of? Enough! Enough? At this juncture I have
\par only one proper course, silence: otherwise tresspass on a domain open
\par alone to one who is younger than I, one stronger, more "_future_" than
\par I--open alone to _Zarathustra, Zarathustra the godless._

\par THIRD ESSAY.
\par 
\par 
\par WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ASCETIC IDEALS?
\par 
\par 
\par "Careless, mocking, forceful--so does wisdom wish us: she is a woman,
\par and never loves any one but a warrior." Thus Spake Zarathustra.
\par 
\par 
\par 1.
\par 
\par What is the meaning of ascetic ideals? In artists, nothing, or too
\par much; in philosophers and scholars, a kind of "flair" and instinct for
\par the conditions most favourable to advanced intellectualism; in women,
\par at best an _additional_ seductive fascination, a little _morbidezza_
\par on a fine piece of flesh, the angelhood of a fat, pretty animal; in
\par physiological failures and whiners (in the _majority_ of mortals),
\par an attempt to pose as "too good" for this world, a holy form of
\par debauchery, their chief weapon in the battle with lingering pain and
\par ennui; in priests, the actual priestly faith, their best engine of
\par power, and also the supreme authority for power; in saints, finally
\par a pretext for hibernation, their _novissima glori\'e6 cupido_, their
\par peace in nothingness ("God"), their form of madness.
\par 
\par But in the very fact that the ascetic ideal has meant so much to
\par man, lies expressed the fundamental feature of man's will, his
\par _horror vacui: he needs a goal_--and he will sooner will nothingness
\par than not will at all.--Am I not understood?--Have I not been
\par understood?--"Certainly not, sir?"--Well, let us begin at the beginning.
\par 
\par 
\par 2.
\par 
\par What is the meaning of ascetic ideals? Or, to take an individual
\par case in regard to which I have often been consulted, what is the
\par meaning, for example, of an artist like Richard Wagner paying homage
\par to chastity in his old age? He had always done so, of course, in a
\par certain sense, but it was not till quite the end, that he did so in
\par an ascetic sense. What is the meaning of this "change of attitude,"
\par this radical revolution in his attitude--for that was what it was?
\par Wagner veered thereby straight round into his own opposite. What is
\par the meaning of an artist veering round into his own opposite? At
\par this point (granted that we do not mind stopping a little over this
\par question), we immediately call to mind the best, strongest, gayest,
\par and boldest period, that there perhaps ever was in Wagner's life: that
\par was the period, when he was genuinely and deeply occupied with the
\par idea of "Luther's Wedding." Who knows what chance is responsible for
\par our now having the _Meistersingers_ instead of this wedding music?
\par And how much in the latter is perhaps just an echo of the former? But
\par there is no doubt but that the theme would have dealt with the praise
\par of chastity. And certainly it would also have dealt with the praise
\par of sensuality, and even so, it would seem quite in order, and even
\par so, it would have been equally Wagnerian. For there is no necessary
\par antithesis between chastity and sensuality: every good marriage, every
\par authentic heart-felt love transcends this antithesis. Wagner would, it
\par seems to me, have done well to have brought this _pleasing_ reality
\par home once again to his Germans, by means of a bold and graceful "Luther
\par Comedy," for there were and are among the Germans many revilers of
\par sensuality; and perhaps Luther's greatest merit lies just in the fact
\par of his having had the courage of his _sensuality_ (it used to be
\par called, prettily enough, "evangelistic freedom "). But even in those
\par cases where that antithesis between chastity and sensuality does exist,
\par there has fortunately been for some time no necessity for it to be in
\par any way a tragic antithesis. This should, at any rate, be the case with
\par all beings who are sound in mind and body, who are far from reckoning
\par their delicate balance between "animal" and "angel," as being on the
\par face of it one of the principles opposed to existence--the most subtle
\par and brilliant spirits, such as Goethe, such as Hafiz,> have even seen
\par in this a _further_ charm of life. Such "conflicts" actually allure
\par one to life. On the other hand, it is only too clear that when once
\par these ruined swine are reduced to worshipping chastity--and there
\par are such swine--they only see and worship in it the antithesis to
\par themselves, the antithesis to ruined swine. Oh what a tragic grunting
\par and eagerness! You can just think of it--they worship that painful
\par and superfluous contrast, which Richard Wagner in his latter days
\par undoubtedly wished to set to music, and to place on the stage! "_For
\par what purpose, forsooth?_" as we may reasonably ask. What did the swine
\par matter to him; what do they matter to us?
\par 
\par 
\par 3.
\par 
\par At this point it is impossible to beg the further question of what he
\par really had to do with that manly (ah, so unmanly) country bumpkin,
\par that poor devil and natural, Parsifal, whom he eventually made a
\par Catholic by such fraudulent devices. What? Was this Parsifal really
\par meant _seriously_? One might be tempted to suppose the contrary, even
\par to wish it--that the Wagnerian Parsifal was meant joyously, like a
\par concluding play of a trilogy or satyric drama, in which Wagner the
\par tragedian wished to take farewell of us, of himself, above all of
\par tragedy, and to do so in a manner that should be quite fitting and
\par worthy, that is, with an excess of the most extreme and flippant parody
\par of the tragic itself, of the ghastly earthly seriousness and earthly
\par woe of old--a parody of that _most crude phase_ in the unnaturalness
\par of the ascetic ideal, that had at length been overcome. That, as I
\par have said, would have been quite worthy of a great tragedian; who like
\par every artist first attains the supreme pinnacle of his greatness when
\par he can look _down_ into himself and his art, when he can _laugh_ at
\par himself. Is Wagner's Parsifal his secret laugh of superiority over
\par himself, the triumph of that supreme artistic freedom and artistic
\par transcendency which he has at length attained. We might, I repeat,
\par wish it were so, for what can Parsifal, _taken seriously_, amount to?
\par Is it really necessary to see in it (according to an expression once
\par used against me) the product of an insane hate of knowledge, mind,
\par and flesh? A curse on flesh and spirit in one breath of hate? An
\par apostasy and reversion to the morbid Christian and obscurantist ideals?
\par And finally a self-negation and self-elimination on the part of an
\par artist, who till then had devoted all the strength of his will to the
\par contrary, namely, the _highest_ artistic expression of soul and body.
\par And not only of his art; of his life as well. Just remember with what
\par enthusiasm Wagner followed in the footsteps of Feuerbach. Feuerbach's
\par motto of "healthy sensuality" rang in the ears of Wagner during the
\par thirties and forties of the century, as it did in the ears of many
\par Germans (they dubbed themselves "_Young_ Germans"), like the word of
\par redemption. Did he eventually _change his mind_ on the subject? For it
\par seems at any rate that he eventually wished to _change his teaching_
\par on that subject ... and not only is that the case with the Parsifal
\par trumpets on the stage: in the melancholy, cramped, and embarrassed
\par lucubrations of his later years, there are a hundred places in which
\par there are manifestations of a secret wish and will, a despondent,
\par uncertain, unavowed will to preach actual retrogression, conversion,
\par Christianity, medi\'e6valism, and to say to his disciples, "All is vanity!
\par Seek salvation elsewhere!" Even the "blood of the Redeemer" is once
\par invoked.
\par 
\par 
\par 4.
\par 
\par Let me speak out my mind in a case like this, which has many painful
\par elements--and it is a typical case: it is certainly best to separate
\par an artist from his work so completely that he cannot be taken as
\par seriously as his work. He is after all merely the presupposition of
\par his work, the womb, the soil, in certain cases the dung and manure,
\par on which and out of which it grows--and consequently, in most cases,
\par something that must be forgotten if the work itself is to be enjoyed.
\par The insight into the _origin_ of a work is a matter for psychologists
\par and vivisectors, but never either in the present or the future for the
\par \'e6sthetes, the artists. The author and creator of Parsifal was as little
\par spared the necessity of sinking and living himself into the terrible
\par depths and foundations of medi\'e6val soul-contrasts, the necessity of a
\par malignant abstraction from all intellectual elevation, severity, and
\par discipline, the necessity of a kind of mental perversity (if the reader
\par will pardon me such a word), as little as a pregnant woman is spared
\par the horrors and marvels of pregnancy, which, as I have said, must
\par be forgotten if the child is to be enjoyed. We must guard ourselves
\par against the confusion, into which an artist himself would fall only
\par too easily (to employ the English terminology) out of psychological
\par "contiguity"; as though the artist himself actually were the object
\par which he is able to represent, imagine, and express. In point of fact,
\par the position is that even if he conceived he were such an object, he
\par would certainly not represent, conceive, express it. Homer would not
\par have created an Achilles, nor Goethe a Faust, if Homer had been an
\par Achilles or if Goethe had been a Faust. A complete and perfect artist
\par is to all eternity separated from the "real," from the actual; on the
\par other hand, it will be appreciated that he can at times get tired to
\par the point of despair of this eternal "unreality" and falseness of his
\par innermost being--and that he then sometimes attempts to trespass on
\par to the most forbidden ground, on reality, and attempts to have real
\par _existence_. With what success? The success will be guessed--it is the
\par _typical velleity_ of the artist; the same velleity to which Wagner
\par fell a victim in his old age, and for which he had to pay so dearly and
\par so fatally (he lost thereby his most valuable friends). But after all,
\par quite apart from this velleity, who would not wish emphatically for
\par Wagner's own sake that he had taken farewell of us and of his art in a
\par _different_ manner, not with a _Parsifal_, but in more victorious, more
\par self-confident, more Wagnerian style--a style less misleading, a style
\par less ambiguous with regard to his whole meaning, less Schopenhauerian,
\par less Nihilistic?...
\par 
\par 
\par 5.
\par 
\par What, then, is the meaning of ascetic ideals? In the case of an artist
\par we are getting to understand their meaning: _Nothing at all_ ... or so
\par much that it is as good as nothing at all. Indeed, what is the use of
\par them? Our artists have for a long time past not taken up a sufficiently
\par independent attitude, either in the world or against it, to warrant
\par their valuations and the changes in these valuations exciting interest.
\par At all times they have played the valet of some morality, philosophy,
\par or religion, quite apart from the fact that unfortunately they
\par have often enough been the inordinately supple courtiers of their
\par clients and patrons, and the inquisitive toadies of the powers that
\par are existing, or even of the new powers to come. To put it at the
\par lowest, they always need a rampart, a support, an already constituted
\par authority: artists never stand by themselves, standing alone is opposed
\par to their deepest instincts. So, for example, did _Richard Wagner_
\par take, "when the time had come," the philosopher Schopenhauer for his
\par covering man in front, for his rampart. Who would consider it even
\par thinkable, that he would have had the _courage_ for an ascetic ideal,
\par without the support afforded him by the philosophy of Schopenhauer,
\par without the authority of Schopenhauer, which _dominated_ Europe in the
\par seventies? (This is without consideration of the question whether an
\par artist without the milk[1] of an orthodoxy would have been possible at
\par all.) This brings us to the more serious question: What is the meaning
\par of a real _philosopher_ paying homage to the ascetic ideal, a really
\par self-dependent intellect like Schopenhauer, a man and knight with a
\par glance of bronze, who has the courage to be himself, who knows how to
\par stand alone without first waiting for men who cover him in front, and
\par the nods of his superiors? Let us now consider at once the remarkable
\par attitude of Schopenhauer towards _art_, an attitude which has even a
\par fascination for certain types. For that is obviously the reason why
\par Richard Wagner _all at once_ went over to Schopenhauer (persuaded
\par thereto, as one knows, by a poet, Herwegh), went over so completely
\par that there ensued the cleavage of a complete theoretic contradiction
\par between his earlier and his later \'e6sthetic faiths--the earlier, for
\par example, being expressed in _Opera and Drama_, the later in the
\par writings which he published from 1870 onwards. In particular, Wagner
\par from that time onwards (and this is the volte-face which alienates us
\par the most) had no scruples about changing his judgment concerning the
\par value and position of music itself. What did he care if up to that time
\par he had made of music a means, a medium, a "woman," that in order to
\par thrive needed an end, a man--that is, the drama? He suddenly realised
\par that _more_ could be effected by the novelty of the Schopenhauerian
\par theory in _majorem music\'e6 gloriam_--that is to say, by means of the
\par _sovereignty_ of music, as Schopenhauer understood it; music abstracted
\par from and opposed to all the other arts, music as the independent
\par art-in-itself, _not_ like the other arts, affording reflections of the
\par phenomenal world, but rather the language of the will itself, speaking
\par straight out of the "abyss" as its most personal, original, and direct
\par manifestation. This extraordinary rise in the value of music (a rise
\par which seemed to grow out of the Schopenhauerian philosophy) was at
\par once accompanied by an unprecedented rise in the estimation in which
\par the musician himself was held: he became now an oracle, a priest, nay,
\par more than a priest, a kind of mouthpiece for the "intrinsic essence
\par of things," a telephone from the other world--from henceforward
\par he talked not only music, did this ventriloquist of God, he talked
\par metaphysic; what wonder that one day he eventually talked _ascetic
\par ideals_.
\par 
\par 
\par 6.
\par 
\par Schopenhauer has made use of the Kantian treatment of the \'e6sthetic
\par problem--though he certainly did not regard it with the Kantian eyes.
\par Kant thought that he showed honour to art when he favoured and placed
\par in the foreground those of the predicates of the beautiful, which
\par constitute the honour of knowledge: impersonality and universality.
\par This is not the place to discuss whether this was not a complete
\par mistake; all that I wish to emphasise is that Kant, just like other
\par philosophers, instead of envisaging the \'e6sthetic problem from the
\par standpoint of the experiences of the artist (the creator), has only
\par considered art and beauty from the standpoint of the spectator, and
\par has thereby imperceptibly imported the spectator himself into the idea
\par of the "beautiful"! But if only the philosophers of the beautiful had
\par sufficient knowledge of this "spectator"!--Knowledge of him as a great
\par fact of personality, as a great experience, as a wealth of strong and
\par most individual events, desires, surprises, and raptures in the sphere
\par of beauty! But, as I feared, the contrary was always the case. And so
\par we get from our philosophers, from the very beginning, definitions
\par on which the lack of a subtler personal experience squats like a fat
\par worm of crass error, as it does on Kant's famous definition of the
\par beautiful. "That is beautiful," says Kant, "which pleases without
\par interesting." Without interesting! Compare this definition with this
\par other one, made by a real "spectator" and "artist"--by Stendhal, who
\par once called the beautiful _une promesse de bonheur_. Here, at any rate,
\par the one point which Kant makes prominent in the \'e6sthetic position is
\par repudiated and eliminated--_le d\'e9sint\'e9ressement_. Who is right, Kant
\par or Stendhal? When, forsooth, our \'e6sthetes never get tired of throwing
\par into the scales in Kant's favour the fact that under the magic of
\par beauty men can look at even naked female statues "without interest,"
\par we can certainly laugh a little at their expense:--in regard to this
\par ticklish point the experiences of _artists_ are more "interesting,"
\par and at any rate Pygmalion was not necessarily an "un\'e6sthetic man." Let
\par us think all the better of the innocence of our \'e6sthetes, reflected
\par as it is in such arguments; let us, for instance, count to Kant's
\par honour the country-parson na\'efvet\'e9 of his doctrine concerning the
\par peculiar character of the sense of touch! And here we come back to
\par Schopenhauer, who stood in much closer neighbourhood to the arts
\par than did Kant, and yet never escaped outside the pale of the Kantian
\par definition; how was that? The circumstance is marvellous enough: he
\par interprets the expression, "without interest," in the most personal
\par fashion, out of an experience which must in his case have been part and
\par parcel of his regular routine. On few subjects does Schopenhauer speak
\par with such certainty as on the working of \'e6sthetic contemplation: he
\par says of it that it simply counteracts sexual interest, like lupulin
\par and camphor; he never gets tired of glorifying this escape from
\par the "Life-will" as the great advantage and utility of the \'e6sthetic
\par state. In fact, one is tempted to ask if his fundamental conception
\par of Will and Idea, the thought that there can only exist freedom from
\par the "will" by means of "idea," did not originate in a generalisation
\par from this sexual experience. (In all questions concerning the
\par Schopenhauerian philosophy, one should, by the bye, never lose sight of
\par the consideration that it is the conception of a youth of twenty-six,
\par so that it participates not only in what is peculiar to Schopenhauer's
\par life, but in what is peculiar to that special period of his life.)
\par Let us listen, for instance, to one of the most expressive among the
\par countless passages which he has written in honour of the \'e6sthetic
\par state (_World as Will and Idea_, i. 231); let us listen to the tone,
\par the suffering, the happiness, the gratitude, with which such words
\par are uttered: "This is the painless state which Epicurus praised as
\par the highest good and as the state of the gods; we are during that
\par moment freed from the vile pressure of the will, we celebrate the
\par Sabbath of the will's hard labour, the wheel of Ixion stands still."
\par What vehemence of language! What images of anguish and protracted
\par revulsion! How almost pathological is that temporal antithesis between
\par "that moment" and everything else, the "wheel of Ixion," "the hard
\par labour of the will," "the vile pressure of the will." But granted
\par that Schopenhauer was a hundred times right for himself personally,
\par how does that help our insight into the nature of the beautiful?
\par Schopenhauer has described one effect of the beautiful,--the calming
\par of the will,--but is this effect really normal? As has been mentioned,
\par Stendhal, an equally sensual but more happily constituted nature than
\par Schopenhauer, gives prominence to another effect of the "beautiful."
\par "The beautiful promises happiness." To him it is just the excitement
\par of the "will"(the "interest") by the beauty that seems the essential
\par fact. And does not Schopenhauer ultimately lay himself open to the
\par objection, that he is quite wrong in regarding himself as a Kantian on
\par this point, that he has absolutely failed to understand in a Kantian
\par sense the Kantian definition of the beautiful--;that the beautiful
\par pleased him as well by means of an interest, by means, in fact, of the
\par strongest and most personal interest of all, that: of the victim of
\par torture who escapes from his torture?--And to come back again to our
\par first question, "What is the meaning of a philosopher paying homage to
\par ascetic ideals?" We get now, at any rate, a first hint; he wishes to
\par escape _from a torture_.
\par 
\par 
\par 7.
\par 
\par Let us beware of making dismal faces at the word "torture"--there is
\par certainly in this case enough to deduct, enough to discount--there is
\par even something to laugh at. For we must certainly not underestimate
\par the fact that Schopenhauer, who in practice treated sexuality as
\par a personal enemy (including its tool, woman, that "_instrumentum
\par diaboli_"), needed enemies to keep him in a good humour; that he loved
\par grim, bitter, blackish-green words; that he raged for the sake of
\par raging, out of passion; that he would have grown ill, would have become
\par a _pessimist_ (for he was not a pessimist, however much he wished to
\par be), without his enemies, without Hegel, woman, sensuality, and the
\par whole "will for existence" "keeping on." Without them Schopenhauer
\par would not have "kept on," that is a safe wager; he would have run away:
\par but his enemies held him fast, his enemies always enticed him back
\par again to existence, his wrath was just as theirs' was to the ancient
\par Cynics, his balm, his recreation, his recompense, his _remedium_
\par against disgust, his _happiness_. So much with regard to what is most
\par personal in the case of Schopenhauer; on the other hand, there is
\par still much which is typical in him--and only now we come back to our
\par problem. It is an accepted and indisputable fact, so long as there
\par are philosophers in the world and wherever philosophers have existed
\par (from India to England, to take the opposite poles of philosophic
\par ability), that there exists a real irritation and rancour on the part
\par of philosophers towards sensuality. Schopenhauer is merely the most
\par eloquent, and if one has the ear for it, also the most fascinating
\par and enchanting outburst. There similarly exists a real philosophic
\par bias and affection for the whole ascetic ideal; there should be no
\par illusions on this score. Both these feelings, as has been said, belong
\par to the type; if a philosopher lacks both of them, then he is--you may
\par be certain of it--never anything but a "pseudo." What does this mean?
\par For this state of affairs must first be, interpreted: in itself it
\par stands there stupid, to all eternity, like any "Thing-in-itself." Every
\par animal, including la b\'eate philosophe, strives instinctively after an
\par _optimum_ of favourable conditions, under which he can let his whole
\par strength have play, and achieves his maximum consciousness of power;
\par with equal instinctiveness, and with a fine perceptive flair which is
\par superior to any reason, every animal shudders mortally at every kind
\par of disturbance and hindrance which obstructs or could obstruct his way
\par to that optimum (it is not his way to happiness of which I am talking,
\par but his way to power, to action, the most powerful action, and in
\par point of fact in many cases his way to unhappiness). Similarly, the
\par philosopher shudders mortally at <b>marriage</b>, together with all
\par that could persuade him to it--marriage as a fatal hindrance on the
\par way to the _optimum_. Up to the present what great philosophers have
\par been married? Heracleitus, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Kant,
\par Schopenhauer--they were not married, and, further, one cannot _imagine_
\par them as married. A married philosopher belongs to _comedy_, that is
\par my rule; as for that exception of a Socrates--the malicious Socrates
\par married himself, it seems, _ironice_, just to prove this _very_ rule.
\par Every philosopher would say, as Buddha said, when the birth of a son
\par was announced to him: "R\'e2houla has been born to me, a fetter has been
\par forged for me" (R\'e2houla means here "a little demon"); there must come
\par an hour of reflection to every "free spirit" (granted that he has had
\par previously an hour of thoughtlessness), just as one came once to the
\par same Buddha: "Narrowly cramped," he reflected, "is life in the house;
\par it is a place of uncleanness; freedom is found in leaving the house."
\par Because he thought like this, he left the house. So many bridges to
\par independence are shown in the ascetic idea], that the philosopher
\par cannot refrain from exultation and clapping of hands when he hears
\par the history of all those resolute ones, who on one day uttered a nay
\par to all servitude and went into some _desert_; even granting that they
\par were only strong asses, and the absolute opposite of strong minds.
\par What, then, does the ascetic ideal mean in a philosopher? This is my
\par answer--it will have been guessed long ago: when he sees this ideal
\par the philosopher smiles because he sees therein an _optimum_ of the
\par conditions of the highest and boldest intellectuality; he does not
\par thereby deny "existence," he rather affirms thereby _his_ existence
\par and _only_ his existence, and this perhaps to the point of not being
\par far off the blasphemous wish, _pereat mundus, fiat philosophia, fiat
\par philosophus, fiam!_
\par 
\par 
\par 8.
\par 
\par These philosophers, you see, are by no means uncorrupted witnesses and
\par judges of the _value_ of the ascetic ideal. They think _of themselves_
\par --what is the "saint" to them? They think of that which to them
\par personally is most indispensable; of freedom from compulsion,
\par disturbance, noise: freedom from business, duties, cares; of clear
\par head; of the dance, spring, and flight of thoughts; of good air--rare,
\par clear, free, dry, as is the air on the heights, in which every animal
\par creature becomes more intellectual and gains wings; they think of
\par peace in every cellar; all the hounds neatly chained; no baying of
\par enmity and uncouth rancour; no remorse of wounded ambition; quiet
\par and submissive internal organs, busy as mills, but unnoticed; the
\par heart alien, transcendent, future, posthumous--to summarise, they
\par mean by the ascetic ideal the joyous asceticism of a deified and
\par newly fledged animal, sweeping over life rather than resting. We know
\par what are the three great catch-words of the ascetic ideal: poverty,
\par humility, chastity; and now just look closely at the life of all
\par the great fruitful inventive spirits--you will always find again
\par and again these three qualities up to a certain extent. _Not_ for a
\par minute, as is self-evident, as though, perchance, they were part of
\par their virtues--what has this type of man to do with virtues?--but as
\par the most essential and natural conditions of their _best_ existence,
\par their _finest_ fruitfulness. In this connection it is quite possible
\par that their predominant intellectualism had first to curb an unruly and
\par irritable pride, or an insolent sensualism, or that it had all its
\par work cut out to maintain its wish for the "desert" against perhaps
\par an inclination to luxury and dilettantism, or similarly against an
\par extravagant liberality of heart and hand. But their intellect did
\par effect all this, simply because it was the _dominant_ instinct, which
\par carried through its orders in the case of all the other instincts.
\par It effects it still; if it ceased to do so, it would simply not be
\par dominant. But there is not one iota of "virtue" in all this. Further,
\par the _desert_, of which I just spoke, in which the strong, independent,
\par and well-equipped spirits retreat into their hermitage--oh, how
\par different is it from the cultured classes' dream of a desert! In
\par certain cases, in fact, the cultured classes themselves are the desert.
\par And it is certain that all the actors of the intellect would not endure
\par this desert for a minute. It is nothing like romantic and Syrian enough
\par for them, nothing like enough of a stage desert! Here as well there
\par are plenty of asses, but at this point the resemblance ceases. But a
\par desert nowadays is something like this--perhaps a deliberate obscurity;
\par a getting-out-of the way of one's self; a fear of noise, admiration,
\par papers, influence; a little office, a daily task, something that hides
\par rather than brings to light; sometimes associating with harmless,
\par cheerful beasts and fowls, the sight of which refreshes; a mountain for
\par company, but not a dead one, one with _eyes_ (that is, with lakes);
\par in certain cases even a room in a crowded hotel where one can reckon
\par on not being recognised, and on being able to talk with impunity to
\par every one: here is the desert--oh, it is lonely enough, believe me!
\par I grant that when Heracleitus retreated to the courts and cloisters
\par of the colossal temple of Artemis, that "wilderness" was worthier;
\par why do we _lack_ such temples? (perchance we do not lack them: I just
\par think of my splendid study in the _Piazza di San Marco_, in spring, of
\par course, and in the morning, between ten and twelve). But that which
\par Heracleitus shunned is still just what we too avoid nowadays: the
\par noise and democratic babble of the Ephesians, their politics, their
\par news from the "empire" (I mean, of course, Persia), their market-trade
\par in "the things of to-day "--for there is one thing from which we
\par philosophers especially need a rest--from the things of "to-day." We
\par honour the silent, the cold, the noble, the far, the past, everything,
\par in fact, at the sight of which the soul is not bound to brace itself up
\par and defend itself--something with which one can speak without _speaking
\par aloud_. Just listen now to the tone a spirit has when it speaks; every
\par spirit has its own tone and loves its own tone. That thing yonder, for
\par instance, is bound to be an agitator, that is, a hollow head, a hollow
\par mug: whatever may go into him, everything comes back from him dull and
\par thick, heavy with the echo of the great void. That spirit yonder nearly
\par always speaks hoarse: has he, perchance, _thought_ himself hoarse?
\par It may be so--ask the physiologists--but he who thinks in _words_,
\par thinks as a speaker and not as a thinker (it shows that he does not
\par think of objects or think objectively, but only of his relations
\par with objects--that, in point of fact, he only thinks of himself and
\par his audience). This third one speaks aggressively, he comes too near
\par our body, his breath blows on us--we shut our mouth involuntarily,
\par although he speaks to us through a book: the tone of his style supplies
\par the reason--he has no time, he has small faith in himself, he finds
\par expression now or never. But a spirit who is sure of himself speaks
\par softly; he seeks secrecy, he lets himself be awaited, A philosopher
\par is recognised by the fact that he shuns three brilliant and noisy
\par things--fame, princes, and women: which is not to say that they do not
\par come to him. He shuns every glaring light: therefore he shuns his time
\par and its "daylight." Therein he is as a shadow; the deeper sinks the
\par sun, the greater grows the shadow. As for his humility, he endures, as
\par he endures darkness, a certain dependence and obscurity: further, he is
\par afraid of the shock of lightning, he shudders at the insecurity of a
\par tree which is too isolated and too exposed, on which every storm vents
\par its temper, every temper its storm. His "maternal" instinct, his secret
\par love for that which grows in him, guides him into states where he is
\par relieved from the necessity of taking care of _himself_, in the same
\par way in which the "_mother_" instinct in woman has thoroughly maintained
\par up to the present woman's dependent position. After all, they demand
\par little enough, do these philosophers, their favourite motto is, "He
\par who possesses is possessed." All this is _not_, as I must say again
\par and again, to be attributed to a virtue, to a meritorious wish for
\par moderation and simplicity; but because their supreme lord so demands
\par of them, demands wisely and inexorably; their lord who is eager only
\par for one thing, for which alone he musters, and for which alone he
\par hoards everything--time, strength, love, interest. This kind of man
\par likes not to be disturbed by enmity, he likes not to be disturbed by
\par friendship, it is a type which forgets or despises easily. It strikes
\par him as bad form to play the martyr, "to _suffer_ for truth"--he leaves
\par all that to the ambitious and to the stage-heroes of the intellect,
\par and to all those, in fact, who have time enough for such luxuries
\par (they themselves, the philosophers, have something _to do_ for truth).
\par They make a sparing use of big words; they are said to be adverse to
\par the word "truth" itself: it has a "high falutin'" ring. Finally, as
\par far as the chastity of philosophers is concerned, the fruitfulness
\par of this type of mind is manifestly in another sphere than that of
\par children; perchance in some other sphere, too, they have the survival
\par of their name, their little immortality (philosophers in ancient
\par India would express themselves with still greater boldness: "Of what
\par use is posterity to him whose soul is the world?"). In this attitude
\par there is not a trace of chastity, by reason of any ascetic scruple or
\par hatred of the flesh, any more than it is chastity for an athlete or a
\par jockey to abstain from women; it is rather the will of the dominant
\par instinct, at any rate, during the period of their advanced philosophic
\par pregnancy. Every artist knows the harm done by sexual intercourse
\par on occasions of great mental strain and preparation; as far as the
\par strongest artists and those with the surest instincts are concerned,
\par this is not necessarily a case of experience--hard experience--but it
\par is simply their "maternal" instinct which, in order to benefit the
\par growing work, disposes recklessly (beyond all its normal stocks and
\par supplies) of the _vigour_ of its _animal_ life; the greater power then
\par _absorbs_ the lesser. Let us now apply this interpretation to gauge
\par correctly the case of Schopenhauer, which we have already mentioned: in
\par his case, the sight of the beautiful acted manifestly like a resolving
\par irritant on the chief power of his nature (the power of contemplation
\par and of intense penetration); so that this strength exploded and became
\par suddenly master of his consciousness. But this by no means excludes
\par the possibility of that particular sweetness and fulness, which is
\par peculiar to the \'e6sthetic state, springing directly from the ingredient
\par of sensuality (just as that "idealism" which is peculiar to girls at
\par puberty originates in the same source)--it may be, consequently, that
\par sensuality is not removed by the approach of the \'e6sthetic state, as
\par Schopenhauer believed, but merely becomes transfigured, and ceases to
\par enter into the consciousness as sexual excitement. (I shall return once
\par again to this point in connection with the more delicate problems of
\par the _physiology of the \'e6sthetic_, a subject which up to the present has
\par been singularly untouched and unelucidated.)
\par 
\par 
\par 9.
\par 
\par A certain asceticism, a grimly gay whole-hearted renunciation, is, as
\par we have seen, one of the most favourable conditions for the highest
\par intellectualism, and, consequently, for the most natural corollaries
\par of such intellectualism: we shall therefore be proof against any
\par surprise at the philosophers in particular always treating the ascetic
\par ideal with a certain amount of predilection. A serious historical
\par investigation shows the bond between the ascetic ideal and philosophy
\par to be still much tighter and still much stronger. It may be said that
\par it was only in the _leading strings_ of this ideal that philosophy
\par really learnt to make its first steps and baby paces--alas how
\par clumsily, alas how crossly, alas how ready to tumble down and lie on
\par its stomach was this shy little darling of a brat with its bandy legs!
\par The early history of philosophy is like that of all good things;--for a
\par long time they had not the courage to be themselves, they kept always
\par looking round to see if no one would come to their help; further, they
\par were afraid of all who looked at them. Just enumerate in order the
\par particular tendencies and virtues of the philosopher--his tendency to
\par doubt, his tendency to deny, his tendency to wait (to be "ephectic"),
\par his tendency to analyse, search, explore, dare, his tendency to compare
\par and to equalise, his will to be neutral and objective, his will for
\par everything which is "_sine ira et studio_":--has it yet been realised
\par that for quite a lengthy period these tendencies went counter to the
\par first claims of morality and conscience? (To say nothing at all of
\par _Reason_, which even Luther chose to call _Frau Kl\'fcglin_,[2] the sly
\par whore.) Has it been yet appreciated that a philosopher, in the event
\par of his _arriving_ at self-consciousness, must needs feel himself an
\par incarnate "nitimur in vetitum"--and consequently guard himself against
\par "his own sensations," against self-consciousness? It is, I repeat, just
\par the same with all good things, on which we now pride ourselves; even
\par judged by the standard of the ancient Greeks, our whole modern life,
\par in so far as it is not weakness, but power and the consciousness of
\par power, appears pure "Hybris" and godlessness: for the things which are
\par the very reverse of those which we honour to-day, have had for a long
\par time conscience on their side, and God as their guardian. "Hybris"
\par is our whole attitude to nature nowadays, our violation of nature
\par with the help of machinery, and all the unscrupulous ingenuity of our
\par scientists and engineers. "Hybris" is our attitude to God, that is, to
\par some alleged teleological and ethical spider behind the meshes of the
\par great trap of the causal web. Like Charles the Bold in his war with
\par Louis the Eleventh, we may say, "je combats l'universelle araign\'e9e";
\par "Hybris" is our attitude to ourselves--for we experiment with ourselves
\par in a way that we would not allow with any animal, and with pleasure
\par and curiosity open our soul in our living body: what matters now to
\par us the "salvation" of the soul? We heal ourselves afterwards: being
\par ill is instructive, we doubt it not, even more instructive than being
\par well--inoculators of disease seem to us to-day even more necessary
\par than any medicine-men and "saviours." There is no doubt we do violence
\par to ourselves nowadays, we crackers of the soul's kernel, we incarnate
\par riddles, who are ever asking riddles, as though life were naught else
\par than the cracking of a nut; and even thereby must we necessarily become
\par day by day more and more worthy to be asked questions and worthy to ask
\par them, even thereby do we perchance also become worthier to--live?
\par 
\par ... All good things were once bad things; from every original sin has
\par grown an original virtue. Marriage, for example, seemed for a long time
\par a sin against the rights of the community; a man formerly paid a fine
\par for the insolence of claiming one woman to himself (to this phase
\par belongs, for instance, the _jus prim\'e6 noctis_, to-day still in Cambodia
\par the privilege of the priest, that guardian of the "good old customs").
\par 
\par The soft, benevolent, yielding, sympathetic feelings--eventually valued
\par so highly that they almost became "intrinsic values," were for a very
\par long time actually despised by their possessors: gentleness was then
\par a subject for shame, just as hardness is now (compare _Beyond Good
\par and Evil_, Aph. 260). The submission to law: oh, with what qualms of
\par conscience was it that the noble races throughout the world renounced
\par the _vendetta_ and gave the law power over themselves! Law was long a
\par _vetitum_, a blasphemy, an innovation; it was introduced with force,
\par like a force, to which men only submitted with a sense of personal
\par shame. Every tiny step forward in the world was formerly made at
\par the cost of mental and physical torture. Nowadays the whole of this
\par point of view--"that not only stepping forward, nay, stepping at all,
\par movement, change, all needed their countless martyrs," rings in our
\par ears quite strangely. I have put it forward in the _Dawn of Day_, Aph.
\par 18. "Nothing is purchased more dearly," says the same book a little
\par later, "than the modicum of human reason and freedom which is now our
\par pride. But that pride is the reason why it is now almost impossible
\par for us to feel in sympathy with those immense periods of the 'Morality
\par of Custom,' which lie at the beginning of the 'world's history,'
\par constituting as they do the real decisive historical principle which
\par has fixed the character of humanity; those periods, I repeat, when
\par throughout the world suffering passed for virtue, cruelty for virtue,
\par deceit for virtue, revenge for virtue, repudiation of the reason for
\par virtue; and when, conversely, well-being passed current for danger, the
\par desire for knowledge for danger, pity for danger, peace for danger,
\par being pitied for shame, work for shame, madness for divinity, and
\par _change_ for immorality and incarnate corruption!"
\par 
\par 
\par 10.
\par 
\par There is in the same book, Aph. 12, an explanation of the _burden_
\par of unpopularity under which the earliest race of contemplative men
\par had to live--despised almost as widely as they were first feared!
\par Contemplation first appeared on earth in a disguised shape, in an
\par ambiguous form, with an evil heart and often with an uneasy head:
\par there is no doubt about it. The inactive, brooding, unwarlike element
\par in the instincts of contemplative men long invested them with a cloud
\par of suspicion: the only way to combat this was to excite a definite
\par _fear_. And the old Brahmans, for example, knew to a nicety how to do
\par this! The oldest philosophers were well versed in giving to their very
\par existence and appearance, meaning, firmness, background, by reason
\par whereof men learnt to _fear_ them; considered more precisely, they
\par did this from an even more fundamental need, the need of inspiring
\par in themselves fear and self-reverence. For they found even in their
\par own souls all the valuations turned _against_ themselves; they had
\par to fight down every kind of suspicion and antagonism against "the
\par philosophic element in themselves." Being men of a terrible age,
\par they did this with terrible means: cruelty to themselves, ingenious
\par self-mortification--this was the chief method of these ambitious
\par hermits and intellectual revolutionaries, who were obliged to force
\par down the gods and the traditions of their own soul, so as to enable
\par themselves to _believe_ in their own revolution. I remember the famous
\par story of the King Vicvamitra, who, as the result of a thousand years
\par of self-martyrdom, reached such a consciousness of power and such a
\par confidence in himself that he undertook to build a _new heaven_: the
\par sinister symbol of the oldest and newest history of philosophy in the
\par whole world. Every one who has ever built anywhere a "_new heaven_"
\par first found the power thereto in his _own hell_.. .. Let us compress
\par the facts into a short formula. The philosophic spirit had, in order
\par to be _possible_ to any extent at all, to masquerade and disguise
\par itself as one of the _previously fixed_ types of the contemplative
\par man, to disguise itself as priest, wizard, soothsayer, as a religious
\par man generally: the _ascetic ideal_ has for a long time served the
\par philosopher as a superficial form, as a condition which enabled him
\par to exist. .. . To be able to be a philosopher he had to exemplify the
\par ideal; to exemplify it, he was bound to _believe_ in it. The peculiarly
\par etherealised abstraction of philosophers, with their negation of the
\par world, their enmity to life, their disbelief in the senses, which has
\par been maintained up to the most recent time, and has almost thereby come
\par to be accepted as the ideal _philosophic attitude_--this abstraction
\par is the result of those enforced conditions under which philosophy
\par came into existence, and continued to exist; inasmuch as for quite
\par a very long time philosophy would have been _absolutely impossible_
\par in the world without an ascetic cloak and dress, without an ascetic
\par self-misunderstanding. Expressed plainly and palpably, the _ascetic
\par priest_ has taken the repulsive and sinister form of the caterpillar,
\par beneath which and behind which alone philosophy could live and slink
\par about.. ..
\par 
\par Has all that really changed? Has that flamboyant and dangerous winged
\par creature, that "spirit" which that caterpillar concealed within itself,
\par has it, I say, thanks to a sunnier, warmer, lighter world, really
\par and finally flung off its hood and escaped into the light? Can we
\par to-day point to enough pride, enough daring, enough courage, enough
\par self-confidence, enough mental will, enough will for responsibility,
\par enough freedom of the will, to enable the philosopher to be now in the
\par world really--_possible_?
\par 
\par 
\par 11.
\par 
\par And now, after we have caught sight of the _ascetic priest_, let us
\par tackle our problem. What is the meaning of the ascetic ideal? It now
\par first becomes serious--vitally serious. We are now confronted with the
\par _real representatives of the serious_. "What is the meaning of all
\par seriousness?" This even more radical question is perchance already
\par on the tip of our tongue: a question, fairly, for physiologists, but
\par which we for the time being skip. In that ideal the ascetic priest
\par finds not only his faith, but also his will, his power, his interest.
\par His _right_ to existence stands and falls with that ideal. What wonder
\par that we here run up against a terrible opponent (on the supposition,
\par of course, that we are the opponents of that ideal), an opponent
\par fighting for his life against those who repudiate that ideal!. .. On
\par the other hand, it is from the outset improbable that such a biased
\par attitude towards our problem will do him any particular good; the
\par ascetic priest himself will scarcely prove the happiest champion of
\par his own ideal (on the same principle on which a woman usually fails
\par when she wishes to champion "woman")--let alone proving the most
\par objective critic and judge of the controversy now raised. We shall
\par therefore--so much is already obvious--rather have actually to help
\par him to defend himself properly against ourselves, than we shall have
\par to fear being too well beaten by him. The idea, which is the subject
\par of this dispute, is the value of our life from the standpoint of the
\par ascetic priests: this life, then (together with the whole of which it
\par is a part, "Nature," "the world," the whole sphere of becoming and
\par passing away), is placed by them in relation to an existence of quite
\par another character, which it excludes and to which it is opposed, unless
\par it _deny_ its own self: in this case, the case of an ascetic life,
\par life is taken as a bridge to another existence. The ascetic treats
\par life as a maze, in which one must walk backwards till one comes to the
\par place where it starts; or he treats it as an error which one may, nay
\par _must_, refute by action: for he demands that he should be followed;
\par he enforces, where he can, his valuation of existence. What does this
\par mean? Such a monstrous valuation is not an exceptional case, or a
\par curiosity recorded in human history: it is one of the most general
\par and persistent facts that there are. The reading from the vantage
\par of a distant star of the capital letters of our earthly life, would
\par perchance lead to the conclusion that the earth was the especially
\par _ascetic planet_, a den of discontented, arrogant, and repulsive
\par creatures, who never got rid of a deep disgust of themselves, of the
\par world, of all life, and did themselves as much hurt as possible out
\par of pleasure in hurting--presumably their one and only pleasure. Let
\par us consider how regularly, how universally, how practically at every
\par single period the ascetic priest puts in his appearance: he belongs to
\par no particular race; he thrives everywhere; he grows out of all classes.
\par Not that he perhaps bred this valuation by heredity and propagated
\par it--the contrary is the case. It must be a necessity of the first order
\par which makes this species, hostile, as it is, to _life_, always grow
\par again and always thrive again.--_Life_ itself must certainly _have an
\par interest_ in the continuance of such a type of self-contradiction. For
\par an ascetic life is a self-contradiction: here rules resentment without
\par parallel, the resentment of an insatiate instinct and ambition, that
\par would be master, not over some element in life, but over life itself,
\par over life's deepest, strongest, innermost conditions; here is an
\par attempt made to utilise power to dam the sources of power; here does
\par the green eye of jealousy turn even against physiological well-being,
\par especially against the expression of such well-being, beauty, joy;
\par while a sense of pleasure is experienced and _sought_ in abortion, in
\par decay, in pain, in misfortune, in ugliness, in voluntary punishment,
\par in the exercising, flagellation, and sacrifice of the self. All this
\par is in the highest degree paradoxical: we are here confronted with a
\par rift that _wills_ itself to be a rift, which _enjoys_ itself in this
\par very _suffering_, and even becomes more and more certain of itself,
\par more and more triumphant, in proportion as its own presupposition,
\par physiological vitality, _decreases_. "The triumph just in the supreme
\par agony ": under this extravagant emblem did the ascetic ideal fight from
\par of old; in this mystery of seduction, in this picture of rapture and
\par torture, it recognised its brightest light, its salvation, its final
\par victory. _Crux, nux, lux_--it has all these three in one.
\par 
\par 
\par 12.
\par 
\par Granted that such an incarnate will for contradiction and unnaturalness
\par is induced to _philosophise_; on what will it vent its pet caprice?
\par On that which has been felt with the greatest certainty to be true,
\par to be real; it will look for _error_ in those very places where the
\par life instinct fixes truth with the greatest positiveness. It will, for
\par instance, after the example of the ascetics of the Vedanta Philosophy,
\par reduce matter to an illusion, and similarly treat pain, multiplicity,
\par the whole logical contrast of "_Subject_" and "_Object_"--errors,
\par nothing but errors! To renounce the belief in one's own ego, to
\par deny to one's self one's own "reality"--what a triumph! and here
\par already we have a much higher kind of triumph, which is not merely
\par a triumph over the senses, over the palpable, but an infliction of
\par violence and cruelty on _reason_; and this ecstasy culminates in the
\par ascetic self-contempt, the ascetic scorn of one's own reason making
\par this decree: _there is_ a domain of truth and of life, but reason is
\par specially _excluded_ therefrom.. .. By the bye, even in the Kantian
\par idea of "the intellegible character of things" there remains a trace
\par of that schism, so dear to the heart of the ascetic, that schism
\par which likes to turn reason against reason; in fact, "intelligible
\par character" means in Kant a kind of quality in things of which the
\par intellect comprehends this much, that for it, the intellect, it is
\par _absolutely incomprehensible_. After all, let us, in our character
\par of knowers, not be ungrateful towards such determined reversals of
\par the ordinary perspectives and values, with which the mind had for
\par too long raged against itself with an apparently futile sacrilege!
\par In the same way the very seeing of another vista, the very _wishing_
\par to see another vista, is no little training and preparation of the
\par intellect for its eternal "_Objectivity_"--objectivity being understood
\par not as "contemplation without interest" (for that is inconceivable
\par and non-sensical), but as the ability to have the pros and cons _in
\par one's power_ and to switch them on and off, so as to get to know how
\par to utilise, for the advancement of knowledge, the _difference_ in
\par the perspective and in the emotional interpretations. But let us,
\par forsooth, my philosophic colleagues, henceforward guard ourselves more
\par carefully against this mythology of dangerous ancient ideas, which has
\par set up a "pure, will-less, painless, timeless subject of knowledge";
\par let us guard ourselves from the tentacles of such contradictory ideas
\par as "pure reason," "absolute spirituality," "knowledge-in-itself":--in
\par these theories an eye that cannot be thought of is required to think,
\par an eye which ex hypothesi has no direction at all, an eye in which
\par the active and interpreting functions are cramped, are absent; those
\par functions, I say, by means of which "abstract" seeing first became
\par seeing something; in these theories consequently the absurd and the
\par non-sensical is always demanded of the eye. There is only a seeing
\par from a perspective, only a "knowing" from a perspective, and the more
\par emotions we express over a thing, the more eyes, different eyes, we
\par train on the same thing, the more complete will be our "idea" of that
\par thing, our "objectivity." But the elimination of the will altogether,
\par the switching off of the emotions all and sundry, granted that we could
\par do so, what! would not that be called intellectual castration?
\par 
\par 
\par 13.
\par 
\par But let us turn back. Such a self-contradiction, as apparently
\par manifests itself among the ascetics, "Life turned against Life,"
\par is--this much is absolutely obvious--from the physiological and not now
\par from the psychological standpoint, simply nonsense. It can only be an
\par apparent contradiction; it must be a kind of provisional expression, an
\par explanation, a formula, an adjustment, a psychological misunderstanding
\par of something, whose real nature could not be understood for a long
\par time, and whose _real essence_ could not be described; a mere word
\par jammed into an old _gap_ of human knowledge. To put briefly the
\par facts against its being real: _the ascetic ideal springs from the
\par prophylactic and self-preservative instincts which mark a decadent
\par life_, which seeks by every means in its power to maintain its position
\par and fight for its existence; it points to a partial physiological
\par depression and exhaustion, against which the most profound and intact
\par life-instincts fight ceaselessly with new weapons and discoveries. The
\par ascetic ideal is such a weapon: its position is consequently exactly
\par the reverse of that which the worshippers of the ideal imagine--life
\par struggles in it and through it with death and against death; the
\par ascetic ideal is a dodge for the _preservation_ of life. An important
\par fact is brought out in the extent to which, as history teaches, this
\par ideal could rule and exercise power over man, especially in all those
\par places where the civilisation and taming of man was completed: that
\par fact is, the diseased state of man up to the present, at any rate, of
\par the man who has been tamed, the physiological struggle of man with
\par death (more precisely, with the disgust with life, with exhaustion,
\par with the wish for the "end"). The ascetic priest is the incarnate wish
\par for an existence of another kind, an existence on another plane,--he
\par is, in fact, the highest point of this wish, its official ecstasy and
\par passion: but it is the very _power_ of this wish which is the fetter
\par that binds him here; it is just that which makes him into a tool that
\par must labour to create more favourable conditions for earthly existence,
\par for existence on the human plane--it is with this very power that he
\par keeps the whole herd of failures, distortions, abortions, unfortunates,
\par _sufferers from themselves_ of every kind, fast to existence, while
\par he as the herdsman goes instinctively on in front. You understand
\par me already: this ascetic priest, this apparent enemy of life, this
\par denier--he actually belongs to the really great _conservative_ and
\par _affirmative_ forces of life.... What does it come from, this diseased
\par state? For man is more diseased, more uncertain, more changeable,
\par more unstable than any other animal, there is no doubt of it--he is
\par the diseased animal: what does it spring from? Certainly he has also
\par dared, innovated, braved more, challenged fate more than all the other
\par animals put together; he, the great experimenter with himself, the
\par unsatisfied, the insatiate, who struggles for the supreme mastery with
\par beast, Nature, and gods, he, the as yet ever uncompelled, the ever
\par future, who finds no more any rest from his own aggressive strength,
\par goaded inexorably on by the spur of the future dug into the flesh of
\par the present:--how should not so brave and rich an animal also be the
\par most endangered, the animal with the longest and deepest sickness
\par among all sick animals?... Man is sick of it, oft enough there are
\par whole epidemics of this satiety (as about 1348, the time of the Dance
\par of Death): but even this very nausea, this tiredness, this disgust
\par with himself, all this is discharged from him with such force that
\par it is immediately made into a new fetter. His "nay," which he utters
\par to life, brings to light as though by magic an abundance of graceful
\par "yeas"; even when he _wounds_ himself, this master of destruction, of
\par self-destruction, it is subsequently the wound itself that forces him
\par to live.
\par 
\par 
\par 14.
\par 
\par The more normal is this sickliness in man--and we cannot dispute
\par this normality--the higher honour should be paid to the rare cases
\par of psychical and physical powerfulness, the _windfalls_ of humanity,
\par and the more strictly should the sound be guarded from that worst of
\par air, the air of the sick-room. Is that done? The sick are the greatest
\par danger for the healthy; it is not from the strongest that harm comes to
\par the strong, but from the weakest. Is that known? Broadly considered,
\par it is not for a minute the fear of man, whose diminution should be
\par wished for; for this fear forces the strong to be strong, to be at
\par times terrible--it preserves in its integrity the sound type of man.
\par What is to be feared, what does work with a fatality found in no other
\par fate, is not the great fear of, but the great _nausea_ with, man; and
\par equally so the great pity for man. Supposing that both these things
\par were one day to espouse each other, then inevitably the maximum of
\par monstrousness would immediately come into the world--the "last will"
\par of man, his will for nothingness, Nihilism. And, in sooth, the way is
\par well paved thereto. He who not only has his nose to smell with, but
\par also has eyes and ears, he sniffs almost wherever he goes to-day an
\par air something like that of a mad-house, the air of a hospital--I am
\par speaking, as stands to reason, of the cultured areas of mankind, of
\par every kind of "Europe" that there is in fact in the world. The _sick_
\par are the great danger of man, _not_ the evil, _not_ the "beasts of
\par prey." They who are from the outset botched, oppressed, broken, those
\par are they, the weakest are they, who most undermine the life beneath the
\par feet of man, who instil the most dangerous venom and scepticism into
\par our trust in life, in man, in ourselves. Where shall we escape from
\par it, from that covert look (from which we carry away a deep sadness),
\par from that averted look of him who is misborn from the beginning, that
\par look which betrays what such a man says to himself--that look which is
\par a groan?" Would that I were something else," so groans this look, "but
\par there is no hope. I am what I am: how could I get away from myself?
\par And, verily--_I am sick of myself!_" On such a soil of self-contempt,
\par a veritable swamp soil, grows that weed, that poisonous growth, and
\par all so tiny, so hidden, so ignoble, so sugary. Here teem the worms
\par of revenge and vindictiveness; here the air reeks of things secret
\par and unmentionable; here is ever spun the net of the most malignant
\par conspiracy--the conspiracy of the sufferers against the sound and the
\par victorious; here is the sight of the victorious _hated_. And what
\par lying so as not to acknowledge this hate as hate! What a show of big
\par words and attitudes, what an art of "righteous" calumniation! These
\par abortions! what a noble eloquence gushes from their lips! What an
\par amount of sugary, slimy, humble submission oozes in their eyes! What do
\par they really want? At any rate to _represent_ righteousness ness, love,
\par wisdom, superiority, that is the ambition of these "lowest ones," these
\par sick ones! And how clever does such an ambition make them! You cannot,
\par in fact, but admire the counterfeiter dexterity with which the stamp
\par of virtue, even the ring, the golden ring of virtue, is here imitated.
\par They have taken a lease of virtue absolutely for themselves, have these
\par weaklings and wretched invalids, there is no doubt of it; "We alone are
\par the good, the righteous," so do they speak, "we alone are the _homines
\par bon\'e6 voluntatis_." They stalk about in our midst as living reproaches,
\par as warnings to us--as though health, fitness, strength, pride, the
\par sensation of power, were really vicious things in themselves, for
\par which one would have some day to do penance, bitter penance. Oh, how
\par they themselves are ready in their hearts to exact penance, how they
\par thirst after being _hangmen_!
\par 
\par Among them is an abundance of revengeful ones disguised as judges,
\par who ever mouth the word righteousness like a venomous spittle--with
\par mouth, I say, always pursed, always ready to spit at everything,
\par which does not wear a discontented look, but is of good cheer as it
\par goes on its way. Among them, again, is that most loathsome species
\par of the vain, the lying abortions, who make a point of representing
\par "beautiful souls," and perchance of bringing to the market as "purity
\par of heart" their distorted sensualism swathed in verses and other
\par bandages; the species of "self-comforters" and masturbators of their
\par own souls. The sick man's will to represent _some_ form or other of
\par superiority, his instinct for crooked paths, which lead to a tyranny
\par over the healthy--where can it not be found, this will to power of
\par the very weakest? The sick woman especially: no one surpasses her
\par in refinements for ruling, oppressing, tyrannising. The sick woman,
\par moreover, spares nothing living, nothing dead; she grubs up again the
\par most buried things (the Bogos say, "Woman is a hyena"). Look into
\par the background of every family, of every body, of every community:
\par everywhere the fight of the sick against the healthy--a silent fight
\par for the most part with minute poisoned powders, with pin-pricks, with
\par spiteful grimaces of patience, but also at times with that diseased
\par pharisaism of _pure_ pantomime, which plays for choice the r\'f4le of
\par "righteous indignation." Right into the hallowed chambers of knowledge
\par can it make itself heard, can this hoarse yelping of sick hounds, this
\par rabid lying and frenzy of such "noble" Pharisees (I remind readers, who
\par have ears, once more of that Berlin apostle of revenge, Eugen D\'fchring,
\par who makes the most disreputable and revolting use in all present-day
\par Germany of moral refuse; D\'fchring, the paramount moral blusterer that
\par there is to-day, even among his own kidney, the Anti-Semites). They
\par are all men of resentment, are these physiological distortions and
\par worm-riddled objects, a whole quivering kingdom of burrowing revenge,
\par indefatigable and insatiable in its outbursts against the happy, and
\par equally so in disguises for revenge, in pretexts for revenge: when
\par will they really reach their final, fondest, most sublime triumph of
\par revenge? At that time, doubtless, when they succeed in pushing their
\par own misery, in fact, all misery, _into the consciousness_ of the happy;
\par so that the latter begin one day to be ashamed of their happiness,
\par and perchance say to themselves when they meet, "It is a shame to be
\par happy! _there is too much misery!_" ... But there could not possibly
\par be a greater and more fatal misunderstanding than that of the happy,
\par the fit, the strong in body and soul, beginning in this way to doubt
\par their right to happiness. Away with this "perverse world"! Away with
\par this shameful soddenness of sentiment! Preventing the sick making the
\par healthy sick--for that is what such a soddenness comes to--this ought
\par to be our supreme object in the world--but for this it is above all
\par essential that the healthy should remain _separated_ from the sick,
\par that they should even guard themselves from the look of the sick, that
\par they should not even associate with the sick. Or may it, perchance,
\par be their mission to be nurses or doctors? But they could not mistake
\par and disown their mission more grossly--the higher must not degrade
\par itself to be the tool of the lower, the pathos of distance must to all
\par eternity keep their missions also separate. The right of the happy to
\par existence, the right of bells with a full tone over the discordant
\par cracked bells, is verily a thousand times greater: they alone are the
\par _sureties_ of the future, they alone are _bound_ to man's future. What
\par they can, what they must do, that can the sick never do, should never
\par do! but if _they are to_ be enabled to do what _only_ they must do,
\par how can they possibly be free to play the doctor, the comforter, the
\par "Saviour" of the sick?... And therefore good air! good air! and away,
\par at any rate, from the neighbourhood of all the madhouses and hospitals
\par of civilisation! And therefore good company, _our own_ company, or
\par solitude, if it must be so! but away, at any rate, from the evil fumes
\par of internal corruption and the secret worm-eaten state of the sick!
\par that, forsooth, my friends, we may defend ourselves, at any rate for
\par still a time, against the two worst plagues that could have been
\par reserved for us--against the _great nausea with man_! against the_
\par great pity for man_!
\par 
\par 
\par 15.
\par 
\par If you have understood in all their depths--and I demand that you
\par should _grasp them profoundly_ and understand them profoundly--the
\par reasons for the impossibility of its being the business of the healthy
\par to nurse the sick, to make the sick healthy, it follows that you have
\par grasped this further necessity--the necessity of doctors and nurses
\par _who themselves are sick_. And now we have and hold with both our hands
\par the essence of the ascetic priest. The ascetic priest must be accepted
\par by us as the predestined saviour, herdsman, and champion of the sick
\par herd: thereby do we first understand his awful historic mission. The
\par _lordship over sufferers_ is his kingdom, to that points his instinct,
\par in that he finds his own special art, his master-skill, his kind of
\par happiness. He must himself be sick, he must be kith and kin to the
\par sick and the abortions so as to understand them, so as to arrive at an
\par understanding with them; but he must also be strong, even more master
\par of himself than of others, impregnable, forsooth, in his will for
\par power, so as to acquire the trust and the awe of the weak, so that he
\par can be their hold, bulwark, prop, compulsion, overseer, tyrant, god.
\par He has to protect them, protect his herds--_against_ whom? Against
\par the healthy, doubtless also against the envy towards the healthy. He
\par must be the natural adversary and _scorner_ of every rough, stormy,
\par reinless, hard, violently-predatory health and power. The priest is
\par the first form of the more delicate animal that scorns more easily
\par than it hates. He will not be spared the waging of war with the beasts
\par of prey, a war of guile (of "spirit") rather than of force, as is
\par self-evident--he will in certain cases find it necessary to conjure up
\par out of himself, or at any rate to represent practically a new type of
\par the beast of prey--a new animal monstrosity in which the polar bear,
\par the supple, cold, crouching panther, and, not least important, the fox,
\par are joined together in a trinity as fascinating as it is fearsome.
\par If necessity exacts it, then will he come on the scene with bearish
\par seriousness, venerable, wise, cold, full of treacherous superiority, as
\par the herald and mouthpiece of mysterious powers, sometimes going among
\par even the other kind of beasts of prey, determined as he is to sow on
\par their soil, wherever he can, suffering, discord, self-contradiction,
\par and only too sure of his art, always to be lord of _sufferers_ at all
\par times. He brings with him, doubtless, salve and balsam; but before he
\par can play the physician he must first wound; so, while he soothes the
\par pain which the wound makes, _he at the same time poisons the wound_.
\par Well versed is he in this above all things, is this wizard and wild
\par beast tamer, in whose vicinity everything healthy must needs become
\par ill, and everything ill must needs become tame. He protects, in sooth,
\par his sick herd well enough, does this strange herdsman; he protects
\par them also against themselves, against the sparks (even in the centre
\par of the herd) of wickedness, knavery, malice, and all the other ills
\par that the plaguey and the sick are heir to; he fights with cunning,
\par hardness, and stealth against anarchy and against the ever imminent
\par break-up inside the herd, where _resentment_, that most dangerous
\par blasting-stuff and explosive, ever accumulates and accumulates. Getting
\par rid of this blasting-stuff in such a way that it does not blow up the
\par herd and the herdsman, that is his real feat, his supreme utility;
\par if you wish to comprise in the shortest formula the value of the
\par priestly life, it would be correct to say the priest is the _diverter
\par of the course of resentment_. Every sufferer, in fact, searches
\par instinctively for a cause of his suffering; to put it more exactly,
\par a doer,--to put it still more precisely, a sentient _responsible_
\par doer,--in brief, something living, on which, either actually or in
\par _effigie_, he can on any pretext vent his emotions. For the venting
\par of emotions is the sufferer's greatest attempt at alleviation, that
\par is to say, _stupefaction_, his mechanically desired narcotic against
\par pain of any kind. It is in this phenomenon alone that is found,
\par according to my judgment, the real physiological cause of resentment,
\par revenge, and their family is to be found--that is, in a demand for the
\par _deadening of pain through emotion_: this cause is generally, but in
\par my view very erroneously, looked for in the defensive parry of a bare
\par protective principle of reaction, of a "reflex movement" in the case
\par of any sudden hurt and danger, after the manner that a decapitated
\par frog still moves in order to get away from a corrosive acid. But the
\par difference is fundamental. In one case the object is to prevent being
\par hurt any more; in the other case the object is to _deaden_ a racking,
\par insidious, nearly unbearable pain by a more violent emotion of any
\par kind whatsoever, and at any rate for the time being to drive it out of
\par the consciousness--for this purpose an emotion is needed, as wild an
\par emotion as possible, and to excite that emotion some excuse or other
\par is needed. "It must be somebody's fault that I feel bad"--this kind of
\par reasoning is peculiar to all invalids, and is but the more pronounced,
\par the more ignorant they remain of the real cause of their feeling bad,
\par the physiological cause (the cause may lie in a disease of the _nervus
\par sympathicus_, or in an excessive secretion of bile, or in a want of
\par sulphate and phosphate of potash in the blood, or in pressure in the
\par bowels which stops the circulation of the blood, or in degeneration of
\par the ovaries, and so forth). Ail sufferers have an awful resourcefulness
\par and ingenuity in finding excuses for painful emotions; they even
\par enjoy their jealousy, their broodings over base actions and apparent
\par injuries, they burrow through the intestines of their past and present
\par in their search for obscure mysteries, wherein they will be at liberty
\par to wallow in a torturing suspicion and get drunk on the venom of their
\par own malice--they tear open the oldest wounds, they make themselves
\par bleed from the scars which have long been healed, they make evil-doers
\par out of friends, wife, child, and everything which is nearest to them.
\par "I suffer: it must be somebody's fault"--so thinks every sick sheep.
\par But his herdsman, the ascetic priest, says to him, "Quite so, my sheep,
\par it must be the fault of some one; but thou thyself art that some one,
\par it is all the fault of thyself alone--_it is the fault of thyself alone
\par against thyself_": that is bold enough, false enough, but one thing is
\par at least attained; thereby, as I have said, the course of resentment
\par is--_diverted_.
\par 
\par 
\par 16.
\par 
\par You can see now what the remedial instinct of life has at least _tried_
\par to effect, according to my conception, through the ascetic priest,
\par and the purpose for which he had to employ a temporary tyranny of
\par such paradoxical and anomalous ideas as "guilt," "sin," "sinfulness,"
\par "corruption," "damnation." What was done was to make the sick
\par _harmless_ up to a certain point, to destroy the incurable by means of
\par themselves, to turn the milder cases severely on to themselves, to give
\par their resentment a backward direction ("man needs but one thing"), and
\par to _exploit_ similarly the bad instincts of all sufferers with a view
\par to self-discipline, self-surveillance, self-mastery. It is obvious that
\par there can be no question at all in the case of a "medication" of this
\par kind, a mere emotional medication, of any real _healing_ of the sick in
\par the physiological sense; it cannot even for a moment be asserted that
\par in this connection the instinct of life has taken healing as its goal
\par and purpose. On the one hand, a kind of congestion and organisation of
\par the sick (the word "Church" is the most popular name for it): on the
\par other, a kind of provisional safeguarding of the comparatively healthy,
\par the more perfect specimens, the cleavage of a _rift_ between healthy
\par and sick--for a long time that was all! and it was much! it was very
\par much!
\par 
\par I am proceeding, as you see, in this essay, from an hypothesis which,
\par as far as such readers as I want are concerned, does not require to be
\par proved; the hypothesis that "sinfulness" in man is not an actual fact,
\par but rather merely the interpretation of a fact, of a physiological
\par discomfort,--a discomfort seen through a moral religious perspective
\par which is no longer binding upon us. The fact, therefore, that any one
\par feels "guilty," "sinful," is certainly not yet any proof that he is
\par right in feeling so, any more than any one is healthy simply because
\par he feels healthy. Remember the celebrated witch-ordeals: in those days
\par the most acute and humane judges had no doubt but that in these cases
\par they were confronted with guilt,--the "witches"_ themselves had no
\par doubt on the point_,--and yet the guilt was lacking. Let me elaborate
\par this hypothesis: I do not for a minute accept the very "pain in the
\par soul" as a real fact, but only as an explanation (a casual explanation)
\par of facts that could not hitherto be precisely formulated; I regard
\par it therefore as something as yet absolutely in the air and devoid of
\par scientific cogency--just a nice fat word in the place of a lean note
\par of interrogation. When any one fails to get rid of his "pain in the
\par soul," the cause is, speaking crudely, to be found _not_ in his "soul"
\par but more probably in his stomach (speaking crudely, I repeat, but by
\par no means wishing thereby that you should listen to me or understand
\par me in a crude spirit). A strong and well-constituted man digests his
\par experiences (deeds and misdeeds all included) just as he digests his
\par meats, even when he has some tough morsels to swallow. If he fails to
\par "relieve himself" of an experience, this kind of indigestion is quite
\par as much physiological as the other indigestion--and indeed, in more
\par ways than one, simply one of the results of the other. You can adopt
\par such a theory, and yet _entre nous_ be nevertheless the strongest
\par opponent of all materialism.
\par 
\par 
\par 17.
\par 
\par But is he really a _physician_, this ascetic priest? We already
\par understand why we are scarcely allowed to call him a physician, however
\par much he likes to feel a "saviour" and let himself be worshipped as a
\par saviour.[3] It is only the actual suffering, the discomfort of the
\par sufferer, which he combats, _not_ its cause, not the actual state of
\par sickness--this needs must constitute our most radical objection to
\par priestly medication. But just once put yourself into that point of
\par view, of which the priests have a monopoly, you will find it hard to
\par exhaust your amazement, at what from that standpoint he has completely
\par seen, sought, and found. The _mitigation_ of suffering, every kind of
\par "consoling"--all this manifests itself as his very genius: with what
\par ingenuity has he interpreted his mission of consoler, with what aplomb
\par and audacity has he chosen weapons necessary for the part. Christianity
\par in particular should be dubbed a great treasure-chamber of ingenious
\par consolations,--such a store of refreshing, soothing, deadening drugs
\par has it accumulated within itself; so many of the most dangerous and
\par daring expedients has it hazarded; with such subtlety, refinement,
\par Oriental refinement, has it divined what emotional stimulants can
\par conquer, at any rate for a time, the deep depression, the leaden
\par fatigue, the black melancholy of physiological cripples--for, speaking
\par generally, all religions are mainly concerned with fighting a certain
\par fatigue and heaviness that has infected everything. You can regard it
\par as _prima facie_ probable that in certain places in the world there
\par was almost bound to prevail from time to time among large masses of
\par the population a _sense of physiological depression_, which, however,
\par owing to their lack of physiological knowledge, did not appear to their
\par consciousness as such, so that consequently its "cause" and its _cure_
\par can only be sought and essayed in the science of moral psychology
\par (this, in fact, is my most general formula for what is generally called
\par a "_religion_"). Such a feeling of depression can have the most diverse
\par origins; it may be the result of the crossing of too heterogeneous
\par races (or of classes--genealogical and racial differences are also
\par brought out in the classes: the European "Weltschmerz," the "Pessimism"
\par of the nineteenth century, is really the result of an absurd and sudden
\par class-mixture); it may be brought about by a mistaken emigration--a
\par race falling into a climate for which its power of adaptation is
\par insufficient (the case of the Indians in India); it may be the effect
\par of old age and fatigue (the Parisian pessimism from 1850 onwards); it
\par may be a wrong diet (the alcoholism of the Middle Ages, the nonsense
\par of vegetarianism--which, however, have in their favour the authority
\par of Sir Christopher in Shakespeare); it may be blood-deterioration,
\par malaria, syphilis, and the like (German depression after the Thirty
\par Years' War, which infected half Germany with evil diseases, and
\par thereby paved the way for German servility, for German pusillanimity).
\par In such a case there is invariably recourse to a _war_ on a grand scale
\par with the feeling of depression; let us inform ourselves briefly on its
\par most important practices and phases (I leave on one side, as stands to
\par reason, the actual _philosophic_ war against the feeling of depression
\par which is usually simultaneous--it is interesting enough, but too
\par absurd, too practically negligible, too full of cobwebs, too much of a
\par hole-and-corner affair, especially when pain is proved to be a mistake,
\par on the _na\'eff_ hypothesis that pain must needs _vanish_ when the mistake
\par underlying it is recognised--but behold! it does anything but vanish
\par ...). That dominant depression is _primarily fought_ by weapons which
\par reduce the consciousness of life itself to the lowest degree. Wherever
\par possible, no more wishes, no more wants; shun everything which produces
\par emotion, which produces "blood" (eating no salt, the fakir hygiene);
\par no love; no hate; equanimity; no revenge; no getting rich; no work;
\par begging; as far as possible, no woman, or as little woman as possible;
\par as far as the intellect is concerned, Pascal's principle, "_il faut
\par s'ab\'eatir._" To put the result in ethical and psychological language,
\par "self-annihilation," "sanctification"; to put it in physiological
\par language, "hypnotism"--the attempt to find some approximate human
\par equivalent for what _hibernation_ is for certain animals, for what
\par _\'e6stivation_ is for many tropical plants, a minimum of assimilation
\par and metabolism in which life just manages to subsist without really
\par coming into the consciousness. An amazing amount of human energy
\par has been devoted to this object--perhaps uselessly? There cannot be
\par the slightest doubt but that such _sportsmen_ of "saintliness," in
\par whom at times nearly every nation has abounded, have really found a
\par genuine relief from that which they have combated with such a rigorous
\par _training_--in countless cases they really escaped by the help of their
\par system of hypnotism _away_ from deep physiological depression; their
\par method is consequently counted among the most universal ethnological
\par facts. Similarly it is improper to consider such a plan for starving
\par the physical element and the desires, as in itself a symptom of
\par insanity (as a clumsy species of roast-beef-eating "freethinkers" and
\par Sir Christophers are fain to do); all the more certain is it that their
\par method can and does pave the way to all kinds of mental disturbances,
\par for instance, "inner lights" (as far as the case of the Hesychasts of
\par Mount Athos), auditory and visual hallucinations, voluptuous ecstasies
\par and effervescences of sensualism (the history of St. Theresa). The
\par explanation of such events given by the victims is always the acme of
\par fanatical falsehood; this is self-evident. Note well, however, the tone
\par of implicit gratitude that rings in the very _will_ for an explanation
\par of such a character. The supreme state, salvation itself, that final
\par goal of universal hypnosis and peace, is always regarded by them as
\par the mystery of mysteries, which even the most supreme symbols are
\par inadequate to express; it is regarded as an entry and homecoming to the
\par essence of things, as a liberation from all illusions, as "knowledge,"
\par as "truth," as "being" as an escape from every end, every wish, every
\par action, as something even beyond Good and Evil.
\par 
\par "Good and Evil," quoth the Buddhists, "both are fetters. The perfect
\par man is master of them both."
\par 
\par "The done and the undone," quoth the disciple of the Vedanta, "do
\par him no hurt; the good and the evil he shakes from off him, sage that
\par he is; his kingdom suffers no more from any act; good and evil, he
\par goes beyond them both."--An absolutely Indian conception, as much
\par Brahmanist as Buddhist. Neither in the Indian nor in the Christian
\par doctrine is this "Redemption" regarded as attainable by means of
\par virtue and moral improvement, however high they may place the value of
\par the hypnotic efficiency of virtue: keep clear on this point--indeed
\par it simply corresponds with the facts. The fact that they remained
\par _true_ on this point is perhaps to be regarded as the best specimen
\par of realism in the three great religions, absolutely soaked as they
\par are with morality, with this one exception. "For those who know,
\par there is no duty." "Redemption is not attained by the acquisition of
\par virtues; for redemption consists in being one with Brahman, who is
\par incapable of acquiring any perfection; and equally little does it
\par consist in the _giving up of faults_, for the Brahman, unity with whom
\par is what constitutes redemption, is eternally pure" (these passages
\par are from the Commentaries of the Cankara, quoted from the first real
\par European _expert_ of the Indian philosophy, my friend Paul Deussen).
\par We wish, therefore, to pay honour to the idea of "redemption" in
\par the great religions, but it is somewhat hard to remain serious in
\par view of the appreciation meted out to the _deep sleep_ by these
\par exhausted pessimists who are too tired even to dream--to the deep
\par sleep considered, that is, as already a fusing into Brahman, as the
\par attainment of the _unio mystica_ with God. "When he has completely gone
\par to sleep," says on this point the oldest and most venerable "script,"
\par "and come to perfect rest, so that he sees no more any vision, then,
\par oh dear one, is he united with Being, he has entered into his own
\par self--encircled by the Self with its absolute knowledge, he has no
\par more any consciousness of that which is without or of that which is
\par within. Day and night cross not these bridges, nor age, nor death,
\par nor suffering, nor good deeds, nor evil deeds." "In deep sleep," say
\par similarly the believers in this deepest of the three great religions,
\par "does the soul lift itself from out this body of ours, enters the
\par supreme light and stands out therein in its true shape: therein is it
\par the supreme spirit itself, which travels about, while it jests and
\par plays and enjoys itself, whether with women, or chariots, or friends;
\par there do its thoughts turn no more back to this appanage of a body,
\par to which the 'prana' (the vital breath) is harnessed like a beast of
\par burden to the cart." None the less we will take care to realise (as
\par we did when discussing "redemption") that in spite of all its pomps
\par of Oriental extravagance this simply expresses the same criticism on
\par life as did the clear, cold, Greekly cold, but yet suffering Epicurus.
\par The hypnotic sensation of nothingness, the peace of deepest sleep,
\par an\'e6sthesia in short\endash \endash that is what passes with the sufferers and the
\par absolutely depressed for, forsooth, their supreme good, their value
\par of values; that is what <b>must</b> be treasured by them as something
\par positive, be felt by them as the essence of _the_ Positive (according
\par to the same logic of the feelings, nothingness is in all pessimistic
\par religions called God).
\par 
\par

\par 
\par Such a hypnotic deadening of sensibility and susceptibility to pain,
\par which presupposes somewhat rare powers, especially courage, contempt
\par of opinion, intellectual stoicism, is less frequent than another
\par and certainly easier _training_ which is tried against states of
\par depression. I mean _mechanical activity_. It is indisputable that a
\par suffering existence can be thereby considerably alleviated. This fact
\par is called to-day by the somewhat ignoble title of the "Blessing of
\par work." The alleviation consists in the attention of the sufferer being
\par absolutely diverted from suffering, in the incessant monopoly of the
\par consciousness by action, so that consequently there is little room left
\par for suffering\endash \endash for _narrow_ is it, this chamber of human consciousness!
\par Mechanical activity and its corollaries, such as absolute regularity,
\par punctilious unreasoning obedience, the chronic routine of life, the
\par complete occupation of time, a certain liberty to be impersonal, nay, a
\par training in "impersonality," self-forgetfulness, "_incuria sui_"\endash \endash with
\par what thoroughness and expert subtlety have all these methods been
\par exploited by the ascetic priest in his war with pain!
\par 
\par When he has to tackle sufferers of the lower orders, slaves, or
\par prisoners (or women, who for the most part are a compound of
\par labour-slave and prisoner), all he has to do is to juggle a little
\par with the names, and to rechristen, so as to make them see henceforth
\par a benefit, a comparative happiness, in objects which they hated--the
\par slave's discontent with his lot was at any rate not invented by the
\par priests. An even more popular means of fighting depression is the
\par ordaining of a _little joy_, which is easily accessible and can be made
\par into a rule; this medication is frequently used in conjunction with
\par the former ones. The most frequent form in which joy is prescribed
\par as a cure is the joy in _producing_ joy (such as doing good, giving
\par presents, alleviating, helping, exhorting, comforting, praising,
\par treating with distinction); together with the prescription of "love
\par your neighbour." The ascetic priest prescribes, though in the most
\par cautious doses, what is practically a stimulation of the strongest
\par and most life-assertive impulse--the Will for Power. The happiness
\par involved in the "smallest superiority" which is the concomitant of all
\par benefiting, helping, extolling, making one's self useful, is the most
\par ample consolation, of which, if they are well-advised, physiological
\par distortions avail themselves: in other cases they hurt each other, and
\par naturally in obedience to the same radical instinct. An investigation
\par of the origin of Christianity in the Roman world shows that
\par co-operative unions for poverty, sickness, and burial sprang up in the
\par lowest stratum of contemporary society, amid which the chief antidote
\par against depression, the little joy experienced in mutual benefits,
\par was deliberately fostered. Perchance this was then a novelty, a real
\par discovery? This conjuring up of the will for co-operation, for family
\par organisation, for communal life, for "_C\'9cnacula_" necessarily brought
\par the Will for Power, which had been already infinitesimally stimulated,
\par to a new and much fuller manifestation. The herd organisation is a
\par genuine advance and triumph in the fight with depression. With the
\par growth of the community there matures even to individuals a new
\par interest, which often enough takes him out of the more personal
\par element in his discontent, his aversion to himself, the "_despectus
\par sui_" of Geulincx. All sick and diseased people strive instinctively
\par after a herd-organisation, out of a desire to shake off their sense of
\par oppressive discomfort and weakness; the ascetic priest divines this
\par instinct and promotes it; wherever a herd exists it is the instinct
\par of weakness which has wished for the herd, and the cleverness of the
\par priests which has organised it, for, mark this: by an equally natural
\par necessity the strong strive as much for _isolation_ as the weak for
\par _union_: when the former bind themselves it is only with a view to an
\par aggressive joint action and joint satisfaction of their Will for Power,
\par much against the wishes of their individual consciences; the latter,
\par on the contrary, range themselves together with positive _delight_ in
\par such a muster--their instincts are as much gratified thereby as the
\par instincts of the "born master" (that is, the solitary beast-of-prey
\par species of man) are disturbed and wounded to the quick by organisation.
\par There is always lurking beneath every oligarchy--such is the
\par universal lesson of history--the desire for tyranny. Every oligarchy
\par is continually quivering with the tension of the effort required by
\par each individual to keep mastering this desire. (Such, _e.g._, was
\par the Greek; Plato shows it in a hundred places, Plato, who knew his
\par contemporaries--and _himself_.)
\par 
\par 
\par 19.
\par 
\par The methods employed by the ascetic priest, which we have already
\par learnt to know--stifling of all vitality, mechanical energy, the
\par little joy, and especially the method of "love your neighbour"
\par herd-organisation, the awaking of the communal consciousness of power,
\par to such a pitch that the individual's disgust with himself becomes
\par eclipsed by his delight in the thriving of the community--these are,
\par according to modern standards, the "innocent" methods employed in
\par the fight with depression; let us turn now to the more interesting
\par topic of the "guilty" methods. The guilty methods spell one thing:
\par to produce _emotional excess_--which is used as the most efficacious
\par an\'e6sthetic against their depressing state of protracted pain; this
\par is why priestly ingenuity has proved quite inexhaustible in thinking
\par out this one question: "_By what means_ can you produce an emotional
\par excess?" This sounds harsh: it is manifest that it would sound nicer
\par and would grate on one's ears less, if I were to say, forsooth: "The
\par ascetic priest made use at all times of the enthusiasm contained in all
\par strong emotions." But what is the good of still soothing the delicate
\par ears of our modern effeminates? What is the good _on our side_ of
\par budging one single inch before their verbal Pecksniffianism. For us
\par psychologists to do that would be at once _practical Pecksniffianism_,
\par apart from the fact of its nauseating us. The _good taste_ (others
\par might say, the righteousness) of a psychologist nowadays consists, if
\par at all, in combating the shamefully moralised language with which all
\par modern judgments on men and things are smeared. For, do not deceive
\par yourself: what constitutes the chief characteristic of modern souls and
\par of modern books is not the lying, but the _innocence_ which is part
\par and parcel of their intellectual dishonesty. The inevitable running up
\par against this "innocence" everywhere constitutes the most distasteful
\par feature of the somewhat dangerous business which a modern psychologist
\par has to undertake: it is a part of our great danger--it is a road which
\par perhaps leads us straight to the great nausea--I know quite well the
\par purpose which all modern books will and can serve (granted that they
\par last, which I am not afraid of, and granted equally that there is to
\par be at some future day a generation with a more rigid, more severe,
\par and _healthier_ taste)--the _function_ which all modernity generally
\par will serve with posterity: that of an emetic,--and this by reason of
\par its moral sugariness and falsity, its ingrained feminism, which it is
\par pleased to call "Idealism," and at any rate believes to be idealism.
\par Our cultured men of to-day, our "good" men, do not lie--that is true;
\par but it does _not_ redound to their honour! The real lie, the genuine,
\par determined, "honest" lie (on whose value you can listen to Plato) would
\par prove too tough and strong an article for them by a long way; it would
\par be asking them to do what people have been forbidden to ask them to do,
\par to open their eyes to their own selves, and to learn to distinguish
\par between "true" and "false" in their own selves. The dishonest lie alone
\par suits them: everything which feels a good man is perfectly incapable of
\par any other attitude to anything than that of a dishonourable liar, an
\par absolute liar, but none the less an innocent liar, a blue-eyed liar, a
\par virtuous liar. These "good men," they are all now tainted with morality
\par through and through, and as far as honour is concerned they are
\par disgraced and corrupted for all eternity. Which of them _could stand_ a
\par further truth "about man"? or, put more tangibly, which of them could
\par put up with a true biography? One or two instances: Lord Byron composed
\par a most personal autobiography, but Thomas Moore was "too good" for it;
\par he burnt his friend's papers. Dr. Gwinner, Schopenhauer's executor, is
\par said to have done the same; for Schopenhauer as well wrote much about
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 himself, and perhaps also against himself: (\'e5}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u7984\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'f2 }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u7953\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 
\'e1\'ed\'f4\'fc\'ed). The virtuous
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 American Thayer, Beethoven's biographer, suddenly stopped his work: he
\par had come to a certain point in that honourable and simple life, and
\par could stand it no longer. Moral: What sensible man nowadays writes one
\par honest word about himself? He must already belong to the Order of Holy
\par Foolhardiness. We are promised an autobiography of Richard Wagner; who
\par doubts but that it would be a _clever_ autobiography? Think, forsooth,
\par of the grotesque horror which the Catholic priest Janssen aroused in
\par Germany with his inconceivably square and harmless pictures of the
\par German Reformation; what wouldn't people do if some real psychologist
\par were to tell us about a genuine Luther, tell us, not with the moralist
\par simplicity of a country priest or the sweet and cautious modesty of a
\par Protestant historian, but say with the fearlessness of a Taine, that
\par springs from force of character and not from a prudent toleration of
\par force. (The Germans, by the bye, have already produced the classic
\par specimen of this toleration--they may well be allowed to reckon him as
\par one of their own, in Leopold Ranke, that born classical advocate of
\par every _causa fortior_, that cleverest of all the clever opportunists.)
\par 
\par 
\par 20.
\par 
\par But you will soon understand me.--Putting it shortly, there is reason
\par enough, is there not, for us psychologists nowadays never getting from
\par a certain mistrust of out _own selves_? Probably even we ourselves are
\par still "too good" for our work, probably, whatever contempt we feel
\par for this popular craze for morality, we ourselves are perhaps none
\par the less its victims, prey, and slaves; probably it infects even us.
\par Of what was that diplomat warning us, when he said to his colleagues:
\par "Let us especially mistrust our first impulses, gentlemen! _they are
\par almost always good_"? So should nowadays every psychologist talk to
\par his colleagues. And thus we get back to our problem, which in point
\par of fact does require from us a certain severity, a certain mistrust
\par especially against "first impulses." The ascetic ideal in the service
\par of projected emotional excess:--he who remembers the previous essay
\par will already partially anticipate the essential meaning compressed
\par into these above ten words. The thorough unswitching of the human
\par soul, the plunging of it into terror, frost, ardour, rapture, so as
\par to free it, as through some lightning shock, from all the smallness
\par and pettiness of unhappiness, depression, and discomfort: what ways
\par lead to _this_ goal? And which of these ways does so most safely?...
\par At bottom all great emotions have this power, provided that they find
\par a sudden outlet--emotions such as rage, fear, lust, revenge, hope,
\par triumph, despair, cruelty; and, in sooth, the ascetic priest has had
\par no scruples in taking into his service the whole pack of hounds that
\par rage in the human kennel, unleashing now these and now those, with the
\par same constant object of waking man out of his protracted melancholy,
\par of chasing away, at any rate for a time, his dull pain, his shrinking
\par misery, but always under the sanction of a religious interpretation
\par and justification. This emotional excess has subsequently to be _paid
\par for_, this is self-evident--it makes the ill more ill--and therefore
\par this kind of remedy for pain is according to modern standards a
\par "guilty" kind.
\par 
\par The dictates of fairness, however, require that we should all the
\par more emphasise the fact that this remedy is applied with _a good
\par conscience_, that the ascetic priest has prescribed it in the most
\par implicit belief in its utility and indispensability;--often enough
\par almost collapsing in the presence of the pain which he created;--that
\par we should similarly emphasise the fact that the violent physiological
\par revenges of such excesses, even perhaps the mental disturbances, are
\par not absolutely inconsistent with the general tenor of this kind of
\par remedy; this remedy, which, as we have shown previously, is _not_ for
\par the purpose of healing diseases, but of fighting the unhappiness of
\par that depression, the alleviation and deadening of which was its object.
\par The object was consequently achieved. The keynote by which the ascetic
\par priest was enabled to get every kind of agonising and ecstatic music
\par to play on the fibres of the human soul--was, as every one knows, the
\par exploitation of the feeling of "_guilt_." I have already indicated in
\par the previous essay the origin of this feeling--as a piece of animal
\par psychology and nothing else: we were thus confronted with the
\par feeling of "guilt," in its crude state, as it were. It was first in
\par the hands of the priest, real artist that he was in the feeling of
\par guilt, that it took shape--oh, what a shape! "Sin"--for that is the
\par name of the new priestly version of the animal "bad-conscience" (the
\par inverted cruelty)--has up to the present been the greatest event in the
\par history of the diseased soul: in "sin" we find the most perilous and
\par fatal masterpiece of religious interpretation. Imagine man, suffering
\par from himself, some way or other but at any rate physiologically,
\par perhaps like an animal shut up in a cage, not clear as to the why and
\par the wherefore! imagine him in his desire for reasons--reasons bring
\par relief--in his desire again for remedies, narcotics at last, consulting
\par one, who knows even the occult--and see, lo and behold, he gets a hint
\par from his wizard, the ascetic priest, his _first_ hint on the "cause" of
\par his trouble: he must search for it in _himself_, in his guiltiness, in
\par a piece of the past, he must understand his very suffering as a _state
\par of punishment_. He has heard, he has understood, has the unfortunate:
\par he is now in the plight of a hen round which a line has been drawn. He
\par never gets out of the circle of lines. The sick man has been turned
\par into "the sinner"--and now for a few thousand years we never get away
\par from the sight of this new invalid, of "a sinner"--shall we ever get
\par away from it?--wherever we just look, everywhere the hypnotic gaze of
\par the sinner always moving in one direction (in the direction of guilt,
\par the _only_ cause of suffering); everywhere the evil conscience, this
\par "_greuliche thier_,"[4] to use Luther's language; everywhere rumination
\par over the past, a distorted view of action, the gaze of the "green-eyed
\par monster" turned on all action; everywhere the wilful misunderstanding
\par of suffering, its transvaluation into feelings of guilt, fear of
\par retribution; everywhere the scourge, the hairy shirt, the starving
\par body, contrition; everywhere the sinner breaking himself on the ghastly
\par wheel of a restless and morbidly eager conscience; everywhere mute
\par pain, extreme fear, the agony of a tortured heart, the spasms of an
\par unknown happiness, the shriek for "redemption." In point of fact,
\par thanks to this system of procedure, the old depression, dullness,
\par and fatigue were absolutely conquered, life itself became _very_
\par interesting again, awake, eternally awake, sleepless, glowing, burnt
\par away, exhausted and yet not tired--such was the figure cut by man,
\par "the sinner," who was initiated into these mysteries. This grand old
\par wizard of an ascetic priest fighting with depression--he had clearly
\par triumphed, _his_ kingdom had come: men no longer grumbled at pain, men
\par _panted_ after pain: "_More pain!_ More pain!" So for centuries on end
\par shrieked the demand of his acolytes and initiates. Every emotional
\par excess which hurt; everything which broke, overthrew, crushed,
\par transported, ravished; the mystery of torture-chambers, the ingenuity
\par of hell itself--all this was now discovered, divined, exploited, all
\par this was at the service of the wizard, all this served to promote the
\par triumph of his ideal, the ascetic ideal. "_My kingdom is not of this
\par world_," quoth he, both at the beginning and at the end: had he still
\par the right to talk like that?--Goethe has maintained that there are only
\par thirty-six tragic situations: we would infer from that, did we not know
\par otherwise, that Goethe was no ascetic priest. He--knows more.
\par 
\par 
\par 21.
\par 
\par So far as all _this_ kind of priestly medicine-mongering, the "guilty"
\par kind, is concerned, every word of criticism is superfluous. As for the
\par suggestion that emotional excess of the type, which in these cases
\par the ascetic priest is fain to order to his sick patients (under the
\par most sacred euphemism, as is obvious, and equally impregnated with
\par the sanctity of his purpose), has ever really been of use to any sick
\par man, who, forsooth, would feel inclined to maintain a proposition of
\par that character? At any rate, some understanding should be come to as
\par to the expression "be of use." If you only wish to express that such a
\par system of treatment has _reformed_ man, I do not gainsay it: I merely
\par add that "reformed" conveys to my mind as much as "tamed," "weakened,"
\par "discouraged," "refined," "daintified," "emasculated" (and thus it
\par means almost as much as injured). But when you have to deal principally
\par with sick, depressed, and oppressed creatures, such a system, even
\par granted that it makes the ill "better," under any circumstances also
\par makes them more _ill_: ask the mad-doctors the invariable result of a
\par methodical application of penance-torture, contrition, and salvation
\par ecstasies. Similarly ask history. In every body politic where the
\par ascetic priest has established this treatment of the sick, disease has
\par on every occasion spread with sinister speed throughout its length
\par and breadth. What was always the "result"? A shattered nervous system,
\par in addition to the existing malady, and this in the greatest as in the
\par smallest, in the individuals as in masses. We find, in consequence of
\par the penance and redemption-training, awful epileptic epidemics, the
\par greatest known to history, such as the St. Vitus and St. John dances
\par of the Middle Ages; we find, as another phase of its after-effect,
\par frightful mutilations and chronic depressions, by means of which the
\par temperament of a nation or a city (Geneva, Bale) is turned once for
\par all into its opposite;--this _training_, again, is responsible for
\par the witch-hysteria, a phenomenon analogous to somnambulism (eight
\par great epidemic outbursts of this only between 1564 and 1605);--we
\par find similarly in its train those delirious death-cravings of large
\par masses, whose awful "shriek," "_evviva la morte!_" was heard over the
\par whole of Europe, now interrupted by voluptuous variations and anon by
\par a rage for destruction, just as the same emotional sequence with the
\par same intermittencies and sudden changes is now universally observed
\par in every case where the ascetic doctrine of sin scores once more a
\par great success (religious neurosis _appears_ as a manifestation of the
\par devil, there is no doubt of it. What is it? _Qu\'e6ritur_). Speaking
\par generally, the ascetic ideal and its sublime-moral cult, this most
\par ingenious, reckless, and perilous systematisation of all methods of
\par emotional excess, is writ large in a dreadful and unforgettable fashion
\par on the whole history of man, and unfortunately not only on history.
\par I was scarcely able to put forward any other element which attacked
\par the health and race efficiency of Europeans with more destructive
\par power than did this ideal; it can be dubbed,without exaggeration,
\par _the real fatality_ in the history of the health of the European man.
\par At the most you can merely draw a comparison with the specifically
\par German influence: I mean the alcohol poisoning of Europe, which up
\par to the present has kept pace exactly with the political and racial
\par pre\endash dominance of the Germans (where they inoculated their blood,
\par there too did they inoculate their vice). Third in the series comes
\par syphilis--_magno sed proximo intervallo_.
\par 
\par 
\par 22.
\par 
\par The ascetic priest has, wherever he has obtained the mastery, corrupted
\par the health of the soul, he has consequently also corrupted _taste in
\par artibus et litteris_--he corrupts it still. "Consequently?" I hope I
\par shall be granted this "consequently "; at any rate, I am not going to
\par prove it first. One solitary indication, it concerns the arch-book of
\par Christian literature, their real model, their "book-in-itself." In the
\par very midst of the Gr\'e6co-Roman splendour, which was also a splendour
\par of books, face to face with an ancient world of writings which had
\par not yet fallen into decay and ruin, at a time when certain books were
\par still to be read, to possess which we would give nowadays half our
\par literature in exchange, at that time the simplicity and vanity of
\par Christian agitators (they are generally called Fathers of the Church)
\par dared to declare: "We too have our classical literature, we _do not
\par need that of the Greeks_"--and meanwhile they proudly pointed to their
\par books of legends, their letters of apostles, and their apologetic
\par tractlets, just in the same way that to-day the English "Salvation
\par Army" wages its fight against Shakespeare and other "heathens" with
\par an analogous literature. You already guess it, I do not like the "New
\par Testament"; it almost upsets me that I stand so isolated in my taste
\par so far as concerns this valued, this over-valued Scripture; the taste
\par of two thousand years is _against_ me; but what boots it! "Here I
\par stand! I cannot help myself"[5]--I have the courage of my bad taste.
\par The Old Testament--yes, that is something quite different, all honour
\par to the Old Testament! I find therein great men, an heroic landscape,
\par and one of the rarest phenomena in the world, the incomparable na\'efvet\'e9
\par _of the strong heart_; further still, I find a people. In the New, on
\par the contrary, just a hostel of petty sects, pure rococo of the soul,
\par twisting angles and fancy touches, nothing but conventicle air, not to
\par forget an occasional whiff of bucolic sweetness which appertains to the
\par epoch (_and_ the Roman province) and is less Jewish than Hellenistic.
\par Meekness and braggadocio cheek by jowl; an emotional garrulousness
\par that almost deafens; passionate hysteria, but no passion; painful
\par pantomime; here manifestly every one lacked good breeding. How dare any
\par one make so much fuss about their little failings as do these pious
\par little fellows! No one cares a straw about it--let alone God. Finally
\par they actually wish to have "the crown of eternal life," do all these
\par little provincials! In return for what, in sooth? For what end? It is
\par impossible to carry insolence any further. An immortal Peter! who could
\par stand _him_! They have an ambition which makes one laugh: the _thing_
\par dishes up cut and dried his most personal life, his melancholies, and
\par common-or-garden troubles, as though the Universe itself were under
\par an obligation to bother itself about them, for it never gets tired of
\par wrapping up God Himself in the petty misery in which its troubles are
\par involved. And how about the atrocious form of this chronic hobnobbing
\par with God? This Jewish, and not merely Jewish, slobbering and clawing
\par importunacy towards God!--There exist little despised "heathen nations"
\par in East Asia, from whom these first Christians could have learnt
\par something worth learning, a little tact in worshiping; these nations
\par do not allow themselves to say aloud the name of their God. This seems
\par to me delicate enough, it is certain that it is _too_ delicate, and
\par not only for primitive Christians; to take a contrast, just recollect
\par Luther, the most "eloquent" and insolent peasant whom Germany has had,
\par think of the Lutherian tone, in which he felt quite the most in his
\par element during his _t\'eate-\'e0-t\'eates_ with God. Luther's opposition to the
\par medi\'e6val saints of the Church (in particular, against "that devil's
\par hog, the Pope"), was, there is no doubt, at bottom the opposition of
\par a boor, who was offended at the _good etiquette_ of the Church, that
\par worship-etiquette of the sacerdotal code, which only admits to the
\par holy of holies the initiated and the silent, and shuts the door against
\par the boors. These definitely were not to be allowed a hearing in this
\par planet--but Luther the peasant simply wished it otherwise; as it was,
\par it was not German enough for him. He personally wished himself to talk
\par direct, to talk personally, to talk "straight from the shoulder" with
\par his God. Well, he's done it. The ascetic ideal, you will guess, was at
\par no time and in no place, a school of good taste, still less of good
\par manners--at the best it was a school for sacerdotal manners: that is,
\par it contains in itself something which was a deadly enemy to all good
\par manners. Lack of measure, opposition to measure, it is itself a "_non
\par plus ultra_."
\par 
\par 
\par 23.
\par 
\par The ascetic ideal has corrupted not only health and taste, there are
\par also third, fourth, fifth, and sixth things which it has corrupted--I
\par shall take care not to go through the catalogue (when should I get to
\par the end?). I have here to expose not what this ideal effected; but
\par rather only what it _means_, on what it is based, what lies lurking
\par behind it and under it, that of which it is the provisional expression,
\par an obscure expression bristling with queries and misunderstandings.
\par And with _this_ object only in view I presumed "not to spare" my
\par readers a glance at the awfulness of its results, a glance at its
\par fatal results; I did this to prepare them for the final and most
\par awful aspect presented to me by the question of the significance of
\par that ideal. What is the significance of the _power_ of that ideal,
\par the monstrousness of its power? Why is it given such an amount of
\par scope? Why is not a better resistance offered against it? The ascetic
\par ideal expresses one will: where is the opposition will, in which an
\par opposition ideal expresses itself? The ascetic ideal has an aim--
\par this goal is, putting it generally, that all the other interests of
\par human life should, measured by its standard, appear petty and narrow;
\par it explains epochs, nations, men, in reference to this one end; it
\par forbids any other interpretation, any other end; it repudiates, denies,
\par affirms, confirms, only in the sense of its own interpretation (and was
\par there ever a more thoroughly elaborated system of interpretation?);
\par it subjects itself to no power, rather does it believe in its own
\par precedence over every power--it believes that nothing powerful exists
\par in the world that has not first got to receive from "it" a meaning,
\par a right to exist, a value, as being an instrument in its work, a
\par way and means to its end, to one end. Where is the _counterpart_ of
\par this complete system of will, end, and interpretation? Why is the
\par counterpart lacking? Where is the other "one aim"? But I am told it
\par is not lacking, that not only has it fought a long and fortunate fight
\par with that ideal, but that further it has already won the mastery over
\par that ideal in all essentials: let our whole modern _science_ attest
\par this--that modern science, which, like the genuine reality-philosophy
\par which it is, manifestly believes in itself alone, manifestly has the
\par courage to be itself, the will to be itself, and has got on well
\par enough without God, another world, and negative virtues.
\par 
\par With all their noisy agitator-babble, however, they effect nothing with
\par me; these trumpeters of reality are bad musicians, their voices do
\par not come from the deeps with sufficient audibility, they are not the
\par mouthpiece for the abyss of scientific knowledge--for to-day scientific
\par knowledge is an abyss--the word "science," in such trumpeter-mouths,
\par is a prostitution, an abuse, an impertinence. The truth is just the
\par opposite from what is maintained in the ascetic theory. Science has
\par to-day absolutely no belief in itself, let alone in an ideal superior
\par to itself, and wherever science still consists of passion, love,
\par ardour, suffering, it is not the opposition to that ascetic ideal, but
\par rather the _incarnation of its latest and noblest form_. Does that ring
\par strange? There are enough brave and decent working people, even among
\par the learned men of to-day, who like their little corner, and who, just
\par because they are pleased so to do, become at times indecently loud with
\par their demand, that people to-day should be quite content, especially
\par in science--for in science there is so much useful work to do. I do
\par not deny it--there is nothing I should like less than to spoil the
\par delight of these honest workers in their handiwork; for I rejoice in
\par their work. But the fact of science requiring hard work, the fact of
\par its having contented workers, is absolutely no proof of science as a
\par whole having to-day one end, one will, one ideal, one passion for a
\par great faith; the contrary, as I have said, is the case. When science
\par is not the latest manifestation of the ascetic ideal--but these are
\par cases of such rarity, selectness, and exquisiteness, as to preclude the
\par general judgment being affected thereby--science is a _hiding-place_
\par for every kind of cowardice, disbelief, remorse, _despectio sui_, bad
\par conscience--it is the very _anxiety_ that springs from having no ideal,
\par the suffering from the _lack_ of a great love, the discontent with an
\par enforced moderation. Oh, what does all science not cover to-day? How
\par much, at any rate, does it not try to cover? The diligence of our best
\par scholars, their senseless industry, their burning the candle of their
\par brain at both ends--their very mastery in their handiwork--how often is
\par the real meaning of all that to prevent themselves continuing to see a
\par certain thing? Science as a self-an\'e6sthetic: _do you know that_? You
\par wound them--every one who consorts with scholars experiences this--you
\par wound them sometimes to the quick through just a harmless word; when
\par you think you are paying them a compliment you embitter them beyond all
\par bounds, simply because you didn't have the _finesse_ to infer the real
\par kind of customers you had to tackle, the _sufferer_ kind (who won't own
\par up even to themselves what they really are), the dazed and unconscious
\par kind who have only one fear--_coming to consciousness_.
\par 
\par 
\par 24.
\par 
\par And now look at the other side, at those rare cases, of which I spoke,
\par the most supreme idealists to be found nowadays among philosophers and
\par scholars. Have we, perchance, found in them the sought-for _opponents_
\par of the ascetic ideal, its _anti-idealists_? In fact, they _believe_
\par themselves to be such, these "unbelievers" (for they are all of them
\par that): it seems that this idea is their last remnant of faith, the idea
\par of being opponents of this ideal, so earnest are they on this subject,
\par so passionate in word and gesture;--but does it follow that what
\par they believe must necessarily be _true_? We "knowers" have grown by
\par degrees suspicious of all kinds of believers, our suspicion has step by
\par step habituated us to draw just the opposite conclusions to what people
\par have drawn before; that is to say, wherever the strength of a belief
\par is particularly prominent to draw the conclusion of the difficulty of
\par proving what is believed, the conclusion of its actual _improbability_.
\par We do not again deny that "faith produces salvation": _for that very
\par reason_ we do deny that faith _proves_ anything,--a strong faith, which
\par produces happiness, causes suspicion of the object of that faith, it
\par does not establish its "truth," it does establish a certain probability
\par of--_illusion_. What is now the position in these cases? These
\par solitaries and deniers of to-day; these fanatics in one thing, in their
\par claim to intellectual cleanness; these hard, stern, continent, heroic
\par spirits, who constitute the glory of our time; all these pale atheists,
\par anti-Christians, immoralists, Nihilists; these sceptics, "ephectics,"
\par and "hectics" of the intellect (in a certain sense they are the
\par latter, both collectively and individually); these supreme idealists
\par of knowledge, in whom alone nowadays the intellectual conscience
\par dwells and is alive--in point of fact they believe themselves as far
\par away as possible from the ascetic ideal, do these "free, very free
\par spirits": and yet, if I may reveal what they themselves cannot see--for
\par they stand too near themselves: this ideal is simply _their_ ideal,
\par they represent it nowadays and perhaps no one else, they themselves
\par are its most spiritualised product, its most advanced picket of
\par skirmishers and scouts, its most insidious delicate and elusive form
\par of seduction.--If I am in any way a reader of riddles, then I will
\par be one with this sentence: for some time past there have been no
\par free spirits; _for they still believe in truth_. When the Christian
\par Crusaders in the East came into collision with that invincible order
\par of assassins, that order of free spirits _par excellence_, whose
\par lowest grade lives in a state of discipline such as no order of monks
\par has ever attained, then in some way or other they managed to get an
\par inkling of that symbol and tally-word, that was reserved for the
\par highest grade alone as their _secretum_, "Nothing is true, everything
\par is allowed,"--in sooth, that was _freedom_ of thought, thereby was
\par _taking leave_ of the very belief in truth. Has indeed any European,
\par any Christian freethinker, ever yet wandered into this proposition
\par and its labyrinthine consequences? Does he know _from experience_ the
\par Minotauros of this den.--I doubt it--nay, I know otherwise. Nothing
\par is more really alien to these "mono-fanatics," these _so-called_
\par "free spirits," than freedom and unfettering in that sense; in no
\par respect are they more closely tied, the absolute fanaticism of their
\par belief in truth is unparalleled. I know all this perhaps too much from
\par experience at close quarters--that dignified philosophic abstinence
\par to which a belief like that binds its adherents, that stoicism of
\par the intellect, which eventually vetoes negation as rigidly as it does
\par affirmation, that wish for standing still in front of the actual,
\par the _factum brutum_, that fatalism in "_petits faits_" (ce petit
\par faitalism, as I call it), in which French Science now attempts a kind
\par of moral superiority over German, this renunciation of interpretation
\par generally (that is, of forcing, doctoring, abridging, omitting,
\par suppressing, inventing, falsifying, and all the other _essential_
\par attributes of interpretation)--all this, considered broadly, expresses
\par the asceticism of virtue, quite as efficiently as does any repudiation
\par of the senses (it is at bottom only a _modus_ of that repudiation.)
\par But what forces it into that unqualified will for truth is the faith
\par _in the ascetic ideal itself_, even though it take the form of its
\par unconscious imperatives,--make no mistake about it, it is the faith,
\par I repeat, in a _metaphysical_ value, an _intrinsic_ value of truth,
\par of a character which is only warranted and guaranteed in this ideal
\par (it stands and falls with that ideal). Judged strictly, there does
\par not exist a science without its "hypotheses," the thought of such a
\par science is inconceivable, illogical: a philosophy, a faith, must always
\par exist first to enable science to gain thereby a direction, a meaning,
\par a limit and method, a _right_ to existence. (He who holds a contrary
\par opinion on the subject--he, for example, who takes it upon himself to
\par establish philosophy "upon a strictly scientific basis"--has first got
\par to "turn up-side-down" not only philosophy but also truth itself--the
\par gravest insult which could possibly be offered to two such respectable
\par females!) Yes, there is no doubt about it--and here I quote my _Joyful
\par Wisdom_, cp. Book V. Aph. 344: "The man who is truthful in that
\par daring and extreme fashion, which is the presupposition of the faith
\par in science, _asserts thereby a different world_ from that of life,
\par nature, and history; and in so far as he asserts the existence of that
\par different world, come, must he not similarly repudiate its counterpart,
\par this world, _our_ world? The belief on which our faith in science is
\par based has remained to this day a metaphysical belief--even we knowers
\par of to-day, we godless foes of metaphysics, we too take our fire from
\par that conflagration which was kindled by a thousand-year-old faith,
\par from that Christian belief, which was also Plato's belief, the belief
\par that God is truth, that truth is _divine_.... But what if this belief
\par becomes more and more incredible, what if nothing proves itself to
\par be divine, unless it be error, blindness, lies--what if God, Himself
\par proved Himself to be our _oldest lie_?"--It is necessary to stop at
\par this point and to consider the situation carefully. Science itself now
\par _needs_ a justification (which is not for a minute to say that there
\par is such a justification). Turn in this context to the most ancient and
\par the most modern philosophers: they all fail to realise the extent of
\par the need of a justification on the part of the Will for Truth--here
\par is a gap in every philosophy--what is it caused by? Because up to the
\par present the ascetic ideal dominated all philosophy, because Truth was
\par fixed as Being, as God, as the Supreme Court of Appeal, because Truth
\par was not allowed to be a problem. Do you understand this "allowed"?
\par From the minute that the belief in the God of the ascetic ideal is
\par repudiated, there exists _a new problem_: the problem of the value of
\par truth. The Will for Truth needed a critique--let us define by these
\par words our own task---the value of truth is tentatively _to be called
\par in question_.... (If this seems too laconically expressed, I recommend
\par the reader to peruse again that passage from the _Joyful Wisdom_ which
\par bears the title, "How far we also are still pious," Aph. 344, and best
\par of all the whole fifth book of that work, as well as the Preface to
\par _The Dawn of Day_.)
\par 
\par 
\par 25.
\par 
\par No! You can't get round me with science, when I search for the natural
\par antagonists of the ascetic ideal, when I put the question: "_Where_
\par is the opposed will in which the _opponent ideal_ expresses itself?"
\par Science is not, by a long way, independent enough to fulfil this
\par function; in every department science needs an ideal value, a power
\par which creates values, and in whose _service_ it _can believe_ in itself
\par --science itself never creates values. Its relation to the ascetic
\par ideal is not in itself antagonistic; speaking roughly, it rather
\par represents the progressive force in the inner evolution of that ideal.
\par Tested more exactly, its opposition and antagonism are concerned not
\par with the ideal itself, but only with that ideal's outworks, its outer
\par garb, its masquerade, with its temporary hardening, stiffening, and
\par dogmatising--it makes the life in the ideal free once more, while it
\par repudiates its superficial elements. These two phenomena, science and
\par the ascetic ideal, both rest on the same basis\endash \endash I have already made
\par this clear\endash \endash the basis, I say, oft the same over-appreciation of truth
\par (more accurately the same belief in the _impossibility_ of valuing and
\par of criticising truth), and consequently they are _necessarily_ allies,
\par so that, in the event of their being attacked, they must always be
\par attacked and called into question together. A valuation of the ascetic
\par ideal inevitably entails a valuation of science as well; lose no time
\par in seeing this clearly, and be sharp to catch it! (_Art_, I am speaking
\par provisionally, for I will treat it on some other occasion in greater
\par detail,\endash \endash art, I repeat, in which lying is sanctified and the _will for
\par deception_ has good conscience on its side, is much more fundamentally
\par opposed to the ascetic ideal than is science: Plato's instinct felt
\par this\endash \endash Plato, the greatest enemy of art which Europe has produced up
\par to the present. Plato _versus_ Homer, that is the complete, the true
\par antagonism\endash \endash on the one side, the whole\endash hearted "transcendental," the
\par great defamer of life; on the other, its involuntary panegyrist, the
\par _golden_ nature. An artistic subservience to the service of the ascetic
\par ideal is consequently the most absolute artistic _corruption_ that
\par there can be, though unfortunately it is one of the most frequent
\par phases, for nothing is more corruptible than an artist.) Considered
\par physiologically, moreover, science rests on the same, basis as
\par does the ascetic ideal: a certain _impoverishment of life_ is the
\par presupposition of the latter as of the former\endash \endash add, frigidity of the
\par emotions, slackening of the _tempo_, the substitution of dialectic for
\par instinct, _seriousness_ impressed on mien and gesture (seriousness,
\par that most unmistakable sign of strenuous metabolism, of struggling,
\par toiling life). Consider the periods in a nation in which the learned
\par man comes into prominence; they are the periods of exhaustion, often
\par of sunset, of decay--the effervescing strength, the confidence in
\par life, the confidence in the future are no more. The preponderance of
\par the mandarins never signifies any good, any more than does the advent
\par of democracy, or arbitration instead of war, equal rights for women,
\par the religion of pity, and all the other symptoms of declining life.
\par (Science handled as a problem! what is the meaning of science?--upon
\par this point the Preface to the _Birth of Tragedy_.) No! this "modern
\par science"--mark you this well--is at times the _best_ ally for the
\par ascetic ideal, and for the very reason that it is the ally which is
\par most unconscious, most automatic, most secret, and most subterranean!
\par They have been playing into each other's hands up to the present, have
\par these "poor in spirit" and the scientific opponents of that ideal (take
\par care, by the bye, not to think that these opponents are the antithesis
\par of this ideal, that they are the _rich_ in spirit--that they are _not_;
\par I have called them the _hectic_ in spirit). As for these celebrated
\par victories of science; there is no doubt that they are _victories_--but
\par victories over what? There was not for a single minute any victory
\par among their list over the ascetic ideal, rather was it made stronger,
\par that is to say, more elusive, more abstract, more insidious, from
\par the fact that a wall, an outwork, that had got built on to the main
\par fortress and disfigured its appearance, should from time to time be
\par ruthlessly destroyed and broken down by science. Does any one seriously
\par suggest that the downfall of the theological astronomy signified the
\par downfall of that ideal?--Has, perchance, man grown _less in need_ of a
\par transcendental solution of his riddle of existence, because since that
\par time this existence has become more random, casual, and superfluous in
\par the _visible_ order of the universe? Has there not been since the time
\par of Copernicus an unbroken progress in the self-belittling of man and
\par his _will_ for belittling himself? Alas, his belief in his dignity, his
\par uniquenesses irreplaceableness in the scheme of existence, is gone--he
\par has become animal, literal, unqualified, and unmitigated animal, he
\par who in his earlier belief was almost God ("child of God," "demi-God").
\par Since Copernicus man seems to have fallen on to a steep plane--he rolls
\par faster and faster away from the centre--whither? into nothingness?
\par into the "thrilling sensation of his own nothingness"--Well! this
\par would be the straight way--to the old ideal?--All science (and by no
\par means only astronomy, with regard to the humiliating and deteriorating
\par effect of which Kant has made a remarkable confession, "it annihilates
\par my own importance"), all science, natural as much as _unnatural_--by
\par unnatural I mean the self-critique of reason--nowadays sets out to
\par talk man out of his present opinion of himself, as though that opinion
\par had been nothing but a bizarre piece of conceit; you might go so far
\par as to say that science finds its peculiar pride, its peculiar bitter
\par form of stoical ataraxia, in preserving man's _contempt of himself_,
\par that state which it took so much trouble to bring about, as man's final
\par and most serious claim to self-appreciation (rightly so, in point
\par of fact, for he who despises is always "one who has not forgotten
\par how to appreciate"). But does all this involve any real effort to
\par _counteract_ the ascetic ideal? Is it really seriously suggested that
\par Kant's _victory_ over the theological dogmatism about "God," "Soul,"
\par "Freedom," "Immortality," has damaged that ideal in any way (as the
\par theologians have imagined to be the case for a long time past)?\endash \endash 
\par And in this connection it does not concern us for a single minute,
\par if Kant himself intended any such consummation. It is certain that
\par from the time of Kant every type of transcendentalist is playing a
\par winning game\endash \endash they are emancipated from the theologians; what luck!\endash \endash he
\par has revealed to them that secret art, by which they can now pursue
\par their "heart's desire" on their own responsibility, and with all the
\par respectability of science. Similarly, who can grumble at the agnostics,
\par reverers, as they are, of the unknown and the absolute mystery, if they
\par now worship _their very query_ as God? (Xaver Doudan talks somewhere
\par of the _ravages_ which _l'habitude d'admirer l'inintelligible au lieu
\par de rester tout simplement dans l'inconnu_ has produced\endash \endash the ancients,
\par he thinks, must have been exempt from those ravages.) Supposing that
\par everything, "known" to man, fails to satisfy his desires, and on the
\par contrary contradicts and horrifies them, what a divine way out of all
\par this to be able to look for the responsibility, not in the "desiring"
\par but in "knowing"!\endash \endash "There is no knowledge. _Consequently_\endash \endash there is
\par a God"; what a novel _elegantia syllogism_i! what a triumph for the
\par ascetic ideal!
\par 
\par 
\par 26.
\par 
\par Or, perchance, does the whole of modern history show in its demeanour
\par greater confidence in life, greater confidence in its ideals? Its
\par loftiest pretension is now to be a _mirror_; it repudiates all
\par teleology; it will have no more "proving"; it disdains to play the
\par judge, and thereby shows its good taste\endash \endash it asserts as little as it
\par denies, it fixes, it "describes." All this is to a high degree ascetic,
\par but at the same time it is to a much greater degree _nihilistic_; make
\par no mistake about this! You see in the historian a gloomy, hard, but
\par determined gaze,\endash \endash an eye that _looks out_ as an isolated North Pole
\par explorer looks out (perhaps so as not to look within, so as not to look
\par back?)\endash \endash there is snow\endash \endash here is life silenced, the last crows which
\par caw here are called "whither?" "Vanity," "Nada"\endash \endash here nothing more
\par flourishes and grows, at the most the metapolitics of St. Petersburg
\par and the "pity" of Tolstoi. But as for that other school of historians,
\par a perhaps still more "modern" school, a voluptuous and lascivious
\par school which ogles life and the ascetic ideal with equal fervour,
\par which uses the word "artist" as a glove, and has nowadays established
\par a "corner" for itself, in all the praise given to contemplation; oh,
\par what a thirst do these sweet intellectuals excite even for ascetics
\par and winter landscapes! Nay! The devil take these "contemplative" folk!
\par How much liefer would I wander with those historical Nihilists through
\par the gloomiest, grey, cold mist!\endash \endash nay, I shall not mind listening
\par (supposing I have to choose) to one who is completely unhistorical
\par and anti-historical (a man, like D\'fchring for instance, over whose
\par periods a hitherto shy and unavowed species of "beautiful souls" has
\par grown intoxicated in contemporary Germany, _the species anarchistica_
\par within the educated proletariate). The "contemplative" are a hundred
\par times worse\endash \endash I never knew anything which produced such intense
\par nausea as one of those "objective" _chairs_,[6] one of those scented
\par mannikins-about-town of history, a thing half-priest, half-satyr (Renan
\par _parfum_), which betrays by the high, shrill falsetto of his applause
\par what he lacks and where he lacks it, who betrays where in this case
\par the Fates have plied their ghastly shears, alas! in too surgeon-like
\par a fashion! This is distasteful to me, and irritates my patience; let
\par him keep patient at such sights who has nothing to lose thereby,\endash \endash such
\par a sight enrages me, such spectators embitter me against the "play,"
\par even more than does the play itself (history itself, you understand);

\par ascetic ideals, the righteous hypocrites of impotence! All reverence
\par on my part to the ascetic ideal, _in so far as it is honourable_! So
\par long as it believes in itself and plays no pranks on us! But I like
\par not all these coquettish bugs who have an insatiate ambition to smell
\par of the infinite, until eventually the infinite smells of bugs; I like
\par not the whited sepulchres with their stagey reproduction of life;
\par I like not the tired and the used up who wrap themselves in wisdom
\par and look "objective"; I like not the agitators dressed up as heroes,
\par who hide their dummy-heads behind the stalking-horse of an ideal; I
\par like not the ambitious artists who would fain play the ascetic and
\par the priest, and are at bottom nothing but tragic clowns; I like not,
\par again, these newest speculators in idealism, the Anti-Semites, who
\par nowadays roll their eyes in the patent Christian-Aryan-man-of-honour
\par fashion, and by an abuse of moralist attitudes and agitation dodges, so
\par cheap as to exhaust any patience, strive to excite all the blockhead
\par elements in the populace (the invariable success of _every_ kind of
\par intellectual charlatanism in present-day Germany hangs together with
\par the almost indisputable and already quite palpable desolation of the
\par German mind, whose cause I look for in a too exclusive diet, of papers,
\par politics, beer, and Wagnerian music, not forgetting the condition
\par precedent of this diet, the national exclusiveness and vanity, the
\par strong but narrow principle, "Germany, Germany above everything,"[7]
\par and finally the _paralysis agitans_ of "modern ideas"). Europe
\par nowadays is, above all, wealthy and ingenious in means of excitement;
\par it apparently has no more crying necessity than _stimulantia_ and
\par alcohol. Hence the enormous counterfeiting of ideals, those most fiery
\par spirits of the mind; hence too the repulsive, evil-smelling, perjured,
\par pseudo\endash alcoholic air everywhere. I should like to know how many cargoes
\par of imitation idealism, of hero-costumes and high falutin' clap-trap,
\par how many casks of sweetened pity liqueur (Firm: _la religion de la
\par souffrance_), how many crutches of righteous indignation for the help
\par of these flat-footed intellects, how many _comedians_ of the Christian
\par moral ideal would need to-day to be exported from Europe, to enable
\par its air to smell pure again. It is obvious that, in regard to this
\par over-production, a new _trade_ possibility lies open; it is obvious
\par that there is a new business to be done in little ideal idols and
\par obedient "idealists"--don't pass over this tip! Who has sufficient
\par courage? We have in _our hands_ the possibility of idealising the whole
\par earth. But what am I talking about courage? we only need one thing
\par here--a hand, a free, a very free hand.
\par 
\par 
\par 27.
\par 
\par Enough! enough! let us leave these curiosities and complexities of
\par the modern spirit, which excite as much laughter as disgust. Our
\par problem can certainly do without them, the problem of _meaning_ of
\par the ascetic ideal--what has it got to do with yesterday or to-day?
\par those things shall be handled by me more thoroughly and severely in
\par another connection (under the title "A Contribution to the History of
\par European Nihilism," I refer for this to a work which I am preparing:
\par _The Will to Power, an Attempt at a Transvaluation of All Values_).
\par The only reason why I come to allude to it here is this: the ascetic
\par ideal has at times, even in the most intellectual sphere, only one
\par real kind of enemies and _damagers_: these are the comedians of this
\par ideal--for they awake mistrust. Everywhere otherwise, where the mind
\par is at work seriously, powerfully, and without counterfeiting, it
\par dispenses altogether now with an ideal (the popular expression for this
\par abstinence is "Atheism")--_with the exception of the will for truth_.
\par But this will, this _remnant_ of an ideal, is, if you will believe me,
\par that ideal itself in its severest and cleverest formulation, esoteric
\par through and through, stripped of all outworks, and consequently not so
\par much its remnant as its _kernel_. Unqualified honest atheism (and its
\par air only do we breathe, we, the most intellectual men of this age) is
\par _not_ opposed to that ideal, to the extent that it appears to be; it is
\par rather one of the final phases of its evolution, one of its syllogisms
\par and pieces of inherent logic--it is the awe-inspiring catastrophe of
\par a two-thousand-year training in truth, which finally forbids itself
\par _the lie of the belief in God_. (The same course of development in
\par India--quite independently, and consequently of some demonstrative
\par value--the same ideal driving to the same conclusion the decisive point
\par reached five hundred years before the European era, or more precisely
\par at the time of Buddha--it started in the Sankhyam philosophy, and then
\par this was popularised through Buddha, and made into a religion.)
\par 
\par _What_, I put the question with all strictness, has really _triumphed_
\par over the Christian God? The answer stands in my _Joyful Wisdom_, Aph.
\par 357: "the Christian morality itself, the idea of truth, taken as it was
\par with increasing seriousness, the confessor-subtlety of the Christian
\par conscience translated and sublimated into the scientific conscience
\par into intellectual cleanness at any price. Regarding Nature as though
\par it were a proof of the goodness and guardianship of God; interpreting
\par history in honour of a divine reason, as a constant proof of a moral
\par order of the world and a moral teleology; explaining our own personal
\par experiences, as pious men have for long enough explained them, as
\par though every arrangement, every nod, every single thing were invented
\par and sent out of love for the salvation of the soul; all this is now
\par done away with, all this has the conscience _against_ it, and is
\par regarded by every subtler conscience as disreputable, dishonourable,
\par as lying, feminism, weakness, cowardice--by means of this severity,
\par if by means of anything at all, are we, in sooth, _good Europeans_
\par and heirs of Europe's longest and bravest self-mastery.". .. All
\par great things go to ruin by reason of themselves, by reason of an act
\par of self-dissolution: so wills the law of life, the law of necessary
\par "self-mastery" even in the essence of life--ever is the law-giver
\par finally exposed to the cry, "_patere legem quam ipse tulisti_"; in
\par thus wise did Christianity _go to ruin as a dogma_, through its own
\par morality; in thus wise must Christianity go again to ruin to-day as
\par a morality--we are standing on the threshold of this event. After
\par Christian truthfulness has drawn one conclusion after the other, it
\par finally draws its _strongest conclusion_, its conclusion against
\par itself; this, however, happens, when it puts the question, "_what is
\par the meaning of every will for truth?_" And here again do I touch on my
\par problem, on our problem, my unknown friends (for as yet _I know_ of no
\par friends): what sense has our whole being, if it does not mean that in
\par our own selves that will for truth has come to its own consciousness
\par _as a problem_?---By reason of this attainment of self-consciousness
\par on the part of the will for truth, morality from henceforward--there
\par is no doubt about it--goes _to pieces_: this is that great hundred-act
\par play that is reserved for the next two centuries of Europe, the most
\par terrible, the most mysterious, and perhaps also the most hopeful of all
\par plays.
\par 
\par 
\par 28.
\par 
\par If you except the ascetic ideal, man, the animal man had no meaning.
\par His existence on earth contained no end; "What is the purpose of man
\par at all?" was a question without an answer; the _will_ for man and the
\par world was lacking; behind every great human destiny rang as a refrain
\par a still greater "Vanity!" The ascetic ideal simply means this: that
\par something _was lacking_, that a tremendous _void_ encircled man--he did
\par not know how to justify himself, to explain himself, to affirm himself,
\par he _suffered_ from the problem of his own meaning. He suffered also in
\par other ways, he was in the main a _diseased_ animal; but his problem
\par was not suffering itself, but the lack of an answer to that crying
\par question, "_To what purpose_ do we suffer?" Man, the bravest animal
\par and the one most inured to suffering, does _not_ repudiate suffering in
\par itself: he _wills_ it, he even seeks it out, provided that he is shown
\par a meaning for it, a _purpose_ of suffering. _Not_ suffering, but the
\par senselessness of suffering was the curse which till then lay spread
\par over humanity--_and the ascetic ideal gave it a meaning!_ It was up
\par till then the only meaning; but any meaning is better than no meaning;
\par the ascetic ideal was in that connection the _"faute de mieux" par
\par excellence_ that existed at that time. In that ideal suffering _found
\par an explanation_; the tremendous gap seemed filled; the door to all
\par suicidal Nihilism was closed. The explanation--there is no doubt about
\par it--brought in its train new suffering, deeper, more penetrating, more
\par venomous, gnawing more brutally into life: it brought all suffering
\par under the perspective of _guilt_; but in spite of all that--man was
\par _saved_ thereby, he had a _meaning_, and from henceforth was no more
\par like a leaf in the wind, a shuttle-cock of chance, of nonsense, he
\par could now "will" something--absolutely immaterial to what end, to what
\par purpose, with what means he wished: _the will itself was saved_. It
\par is absolutely impossible to disguise _what_ in point of fact is made
\par clear by every complete will that has taken its direction from the
\par ascetic ideal: this hate of the human, and even more of the animal,
\par and more still of the material, this horror of the senses, of reason
\par itself, this fear of happiness and beauty, this desire to get right
\par away from all illusion, change, growth, death, wishing and even
\par desiring--all this means--let us have the courage to grasp it--a will
\par for Nothingness, a will opposed to life, a repudiation of the most
\par fundamental conditions of life, but it is and remains _a will_!--and
\par to say at the end that which I said at the beginning--man will wish
\par _Nothingness_ rather than not wish _at all_.

\par 
\par 
\par [The following twenty-seven fragments were intended by Nietzsche to
\par form a supplement to Chapter VIII. of _Beyond Good and Evil_, dealing
\par with Peoples and Countries.]
\par 
\par 
\par 1.
\par 
\par The Europeans now imagine themselves as representing, in the main, the
\par highest types of men on earth.
\par 
\par 
\par 2.
\par 
\par A characteristic of Europeans: inconsistency between word and deed;
\par the Oriental is true to himself in daily life. How the European has
\par established colonies is explained by his nature, which resembles that
\par of a beast of prey.
\par 
\par This inconsistency is explained by the fact that Christianity has
\par abandoned the class from which it sprang.
\par 
\par This is the difference between us and the Hellenes: their morals grew
\par up among the governing castes. Thucydides' morals are the same as those
\par that exploded everywhere with Plato.
\par 
\par Attempts towards honesty at the Renaissance, for example: always for
\par the benefit of the arts. Michael Angelo's conception of God as the
\par "Tyrant of the World" was an honest one.
\par 
\par 
\par 3.
\par 
\par I rate Michael Angelo higher than Raphael, because, through all the
\par Christian clouds and prejudices of his time, he saw the ideal of a
\par culture _nobler_ than the Christo-Raphaelian: whilst Raphael truly
\par and modestly glorified only the values handed down to him, and did
\par not carry within himself any inquiring, yearning instincts. Michael
\par Angelo, on the other hand, saw and felt the problem of the law-giver of
\par new values: the problem of the conqueror made perfect, who first had
\par to subdue the "hero within himself," the man exalted to his highest
\par pedestal, master even of his pity, who mercilessly shatters and
\par annihilates everything that does not bear his own stamp, shining in
\par Olympian divinity. Michael Angelo was naturally only at certain moments
\par so high and so far beyond his age and Christian Europe: for the most
\par part he adopted a condescending attitude towards the eternal feminine
\par in Christianity; it would seem, indeed, that in the end he broke down
\par before her, and gave up the ideal of his most inspired hours. It was
\par an ideal which only a man in the strongest and highest vigour of life
\par could bear; but not a man advanced in years! Indeed, he would have had
\par to demolish Christianity with his ideal! But he was not thinker and
\par philosopher enough for that Perhaps Leonardo da Vinci alone of those
\par artists had a really super-Christian outlook. He knows the East, the
\par "land of dawn," within himself as well as without himself. There is
\par something super-European and silent in him: a characteristic of every
\par one who has seen too wide a circle of things good and bad.
\par 
\par 
\par 4.
\par 
\par How much we have learnt and learnt anew in fifty years! The whole
\par Romantic School with its belief in "the people" is refuted! No Homeric
\par poetry as "popular" poetry! No deification of the great powers of
\par Nature! No deduction from language-relationship to race-relationship!
\par No "intellectual contemplations" of the supernatural! No truth
\par enshrouded in religion!
\par 
\par The problem of truthfulness is quite a new one. I am astonished. From
\par this standpoint we regard such natures as Bismarck as culpable out of
\par carelessness, such as Richard Wagner out of want of modesty; we would
\par condemn Plato for his _pia fraus_, Kant for the derivation of his
\par Categorical Imperative, his own belief certainly not having come to him
\par from this source.
\par 
\par Finally, even doubt turns against itself: doubt in doubt. And the
\par question as to the _value_ of truthfulness and its extent lies _there_.
\par 
\par 
\par 5.
\par 
\par What I observe with pleasure in the German is his Mephistophelian
\par nature; but, to tell the truth, one must have a higher conception of
\par Mephistopheles than Goethe had, who found it necessary to _diminish_
\par his Mephistopheles in order to magnify his "inner Faust." The true
\par German Mephistopheles is much more dangerous, bold, wicked, and
\par cunning, and consequently more open-hearted: remember the nature
\par of Frederick the Great, or of that much greater Frederick, the
\par Hohenstaufen, Frederick II.
\par 
\par The real German Mephistopheles crosses the Alps, and believes that
\par everything there belongs to him. Then he recovers himself, like
\par Winckelmann, like Mozart. He looks upon Faust and Hamlet as
\par caricatures, invented to be laughed at, and upon Luther also. Goethe
\par had his good German moments, when he laughed inwardly at all these
\par things. But then he fell back again into his cloudy moods.
\par 
\par 
\par 6.
\par 
\par Perhaps the Germans have only grown up in a wrong climate! There is
\par something in them that might be Hellenic!--something that is awakened
\par when they are brought into touch with the South--Winckelmann, Goethe,
\par Mozart. We should not forget, however, that we are still young. Luther
\par is still our last event; our last book is still the Bible. The Germans
\par have never yet "moralised." Also, the very food of the Germans was
\par their doom: its consequence, Philistinism.
\par 
\par 
\par 7.
\par 
\par The Germans are a dangerous people: they are experts at inventing
\par intoxicants. Gothic, rococo (according to Semper), the historical sense
\par and exoticism, Hegel, Richard Wagner--Leibniz, too (dangerous at the
\par present day)--(they even idealised the serving soul as the virtue of
\par scholars and soldiers, also as the simple mind). The Germans may well
\par be the most composite people on earth.
\par 
\par "The people of the Middle," the inventors of porcelain, and of a kind
\par of Chinese breed of Privy Councillor.
\par 
\par 
\par 8.
\par 
\par The smallness and baseness of the German soul were not and are not
\par consequences of the system of small states; for it is well known that
\par the inhabitants of much smaller states were proud and independent:
\par and it is not a large state _per se_ that makes souls freer and more
\par manly. The man whose soul obeys the slavish command: "Thou shalt and
\par must kneel!" in whose body there is an involuntary bowing and scraping
\par to titles, orders, gracious glances from above--well, such a man
\par in an "Empire" will only bow all the more deeply and lick the dust
\par more fervently in the presence of the greater sovereign than in the
\par presence of the lesser: this cannot be doubted. We can still see in the
\par lower classes of Italians that aristocratic self-sufficiency; manly
\par discipline and self-confidence still form a part of the long history
\par of their country: these are virtues which once manifested themselves
\par before their eyes. A poor Venetian gondolier makes a far better figure
\par than a Privy Councillor from Berlin, and is even a better man in the
\par end--any one can see this. Just ask the women.
\par 
\par 
\par 9.
\par 
\par Most artists, even some of the greatest (including the historians) have
\par up to the present belonged to the serving classes (whether they serve
\par people of high position or princes or women or "the masses"), not to
\par speak of their dependence upon the Church and upon moral law. Thus
\par Rubens portrayed the nobility of his age; but only according to their
\par vague conception of taste, not according to his own measure of beauty
\par on the whole, therefore, against his own taste. Van Dyck was nobler in
\par this respect: who in all those whom he painted added a certain amount
\par of what he himself most highly valued: he did not descend from himself,
\par but rather lifted up others to himself when he "rendered."
\par 
\par The slavish humility of the artist to his public (as Sebastian Bach has
\par testified in undying and outrageous words in the dedication of his High
\par Mass) is perhaps more difficult to perceive in music; but it is all the
\par more deeply engrained. A hearing would be refused me if I endeavoured
\par to impart my views on this subject. Chopin possesses distinction, like
\par Van Dyck. The disposition of Beethoven is that of a proud peasant;
\par of Haydn, that of a proud servant. Mendelssohn, too, possesses
\par distinction--like Goethe, in the most natural way in the world.
\par 
\par 
\par 10.
\par 
\par We could at any time have counted on the fingers of one hand those
\par German learned men who possessed wit: the remainder have understanding,
\par and a few of them, happily, that famous "childlike character"
\par which divines.... It is our privilege: with this "divination" German
\par science has discovered some things which we can hardly conceive of, and
\par which, after all, do not exist, perhaps. It is only the Jews among the
\par Germans who do not "divine" like them.
\par 
\par 
\par 11.
\par 
\par As Frenchmen reflect the politeness and _esprit_ of French society,
\par so do Germans reflect something of the deep, pensive earnestness of
\par their mystics and musicians, and also of their silly childishness. The
\par Italian exhibits a great deal of republican distinction and art, and
\par can show himself to be noble and proud without vanity.
\par 
\par 
\par 12.
\par 
\par A larger number of the higher and better-endowed men will, I hope, have
\par in the end so much self-restraint as to be able to get rid of their bad
\par taste for affectation and sentimental darkness, and to turn against
\par Richard Wagner as much as against Schopenhauer. These two Germans are
\par leading us to ruin; they flatter our dangerous qualities. A stronger
\par future is prepared for us in Goethe, Beethoven, and Bismarck than in
\par these racial aberrations. We have had no philosophers yet.
\par 
\par 
\par 13.
\par 
\par The peasant is the commonest type of noblesse, for he is dependent upon
\par himself most of all. Peasant blood is still the best blood in Germany
\par --for example, Luther, Niebuhr, Bismarck.
\par 
\par Bismarck a Slav. Let any one look upon the face of Germans. Everything
\par that had manly, exuberant blood in it went abroad. Over the smug
\par populace remaining, the slave-souled people, there came an improvement
\par from abroad, especially by a mixture of Slavonic blood.
\par 
\par The Brandenburg nobility and the Prussian nobility in general (and the
\par peasant of certain North German districts), comprise at present the
\par most manly natures in Germany.
\par 
\par That the manliest men shall rule: this is only the natural order of
\par things.
\par 
\par 
\par 14.
\par 
\par The future of German culture rests with the sons of the Prussian
\par officers.
\par 
\par 
\par 15.
\par 
\par There has always been a want of wit in Germany, and mediocre heads
\par attain there to the highest honours, because even they are rare. What
\par is most highly prized is diligence and perseverance and a certain
\par cold-blooded, critical outlook, and, for the sake of such qualities,
\par German scholarship and the German military system have become paramount
\par in Europe.
\par 
\par 
\par 16.
\par 
\par Parliaments may be very useful to a strong and versatile statesman:
\par he has something there to rely upon (every such thing must, however,
\par be able to resist!)--upon which he can throw a great deal of
\par responsibility. On the whole, however, I could wish that the counting
\par mania and the superstitious belief in majorities were not established
\par in Germany, as with the Latin races, and that one could finally invent
\par something new even in politics! It is senseless and dangerous to let
\par the custom of universal suffrage--which is still but a short time under
\par cultivation, and could easily be uprooted--take a deeper root: whilst,
\par of course, its introduction was merely an expedient to steer clear of
\par temporary difficulties.
\par 
\par 
\par 17.
\par 
\par Can any one interest himself in this German Empire? Where is the new
\par thought? Is it only a new combination of power? All the worse, if it
\par does not know its own mind. Peace and laisser aller are not types of
\par politics for which I have any respect. Ruling, and helping the highest
\par thoughts to victory--the only things that can make me interested in
\par Germany. England's small-mindedness is the great danger now on earth.
\par I observe more inclination towards greatness in the feelings of the
\par Russian Nihilists than in those of the English Utilitarians. We require
\par an intergrowth of the German and Slav races, and we require, too, the
\par cleverest financiers, the Jews, for us to become masters of the world.
\par 
\par (a) The sense of reality.
\par 
\par (b) A giving-up of the English principle of the people's right of
\par representation. We require the representation of the great interests.
\par 
\par (c) We require an unconditional union with Russia, together with a
\par mutual plan of action which shall not permit any English schemata to
\par obtain the mastery in Russia. No American future!
\par 
\par (d) A national system of politics is untenable, and embarrassment by
\par Christian views is a very great evil. In Europe all sensible people are
\par sceptics, whether they say so or not.
\par 
\par 
\par 18.
\par 
\par I see over and beyond all these national wars, new "empires," and
\par whatever else lies in the foreground. What I am concerned with--for I
\par see it preparing itself slowly and hesitatingly--is the United Europe.
\par It was the only real work, the one impulse in the souls, of all the
\par broad-minded and deep-thinking men of this century--this preparation
\par of a new synthesis, and the tentative effort to anticipate the future
\par of "the European." Only in their weaker moments, or when they grew
\par old, did they fall back again into the national narrowness of the
\par "Fatherlanders"--then they were once more "patriots." I am thinking
\par of men like Napoleon, Heinrich Heine, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal,
\par Schopenhauer. Perhaps Richard Wagner likewise belongs to their number,
\par concerning whom, as a successful type of German obscurity, nothing can
\par be said without some such "perhaps."
\par 
\par But to the help of such minds as feel the need of a new unity there
\par comes a great explanatory economic fact: the small States of Europe--I
\par refer to all our present kingdoms and "empires"--will in a short time
\par become economically untenable, owing to the mad, uncontrolled struggle
\par for the possession of local and international trade. Money is even
\par now compelling European nations to amalgamate into one Power. In
\par order, however, that Europe may enter into the battle for the mastery
\par of the world with good prospects of victory (it is easy to perceive
\par against whom this battle will be waged), she must probably "come to
\par an understanding" with England. The English colonies are needed for
\par this struggle, just as much as modern Germany, to play her new r\'f4le of
\par broker and middleman, requires the colonial possessions of Holland.
\par For no one any longer believes that England alone is strong enough to
\par continue to act her old part for fifty years more; the impossibility
\par of shutting out _homines novi_ from the government will ruin her, and
\par her continual change of political parties is a fatal obstacle to the
\par carrying out of any tasks which require to be spread out over a long
\par period of time. A man must to-day be a soldier first and foremost that
\par he may not afterwards lose his credit as a merchant. Enough; here,
\par as in other matters, the coming century will be found following in
\par the footsteps of Napoleon--the first man, and the man of greatest
\par initiative and advanced views, of modern times. For the tasks of the
\par next century, the methods of popular representation and parliaments are
\par the most inappropriate imaginable.
\par 
\par 
\par 19.
\par 
\par The condition of Europe in the next century will once again lead to the
\par breeding of manly virtues, because men will live in continual danger.
\par Universal military service is already the curious antidote which we
\par possess for the effeminacy of democratic ideas, and it has grown up out
\par of the struggle of the nations. (Nation--men who speak one language
\par and read the same newspapers. These men now call themselves "nations,"
\par and would far too readily trace their descent from the same source and
\par through the same history; which, however, even with the assistance of
\par the most malignant lying in the past, they have not succeeded in
\par doing.)
\par 
\par 
\par 20.

\par What quagmires and mendacity must there be about if it is possible,
\par in the modern European hotch-potch, to raise questions of "race"! (It
\par being premised that the origin of such writers is not in Horneo and
\par Borneo.)

\par To make Europe a centre of culture, national stupidities should not
\par make us blind to the fact that in the higher regions there is already a
\par continuous reciprocal dependence. France and German philosophy. Richard
\par Wagner and Paris (1830-50). Goethe and Greece. All things are impelled
\par towards, a synthesis of the European past in the highest types of mind.

\par Mankind has still much before it--how, generally speaking, could
\par the ideal be taken from the past? Perhaps merely in relation to the
\par present, which latter is possibly a lower region.

\par 
\par This is our distrust, which recurs again and again; our care, which
\par never lets us sleep; our question, which no one listens to or wishes
\par to listen to; our Sphinx, near which there is more than one precipice:
\par we believe that the men of present-day Europe are deceived in regard
\par to the things which we love best, and a pitiless demon (no, not
\par pitiless, only indifferent and puerile)--plays with our hearts and
\par their enthusiasm, as it may perhaps have already played with everything
\par that lived and loved; I believe that everything which we Europeans
\par of to-day are in the habit of admiring as the values of all these
\par respected things called "humanity," "mankind," "sympathy," "pity," may
\par be of some value as the debilitation and moderating of certain powerful
\par and dangerous primitive impulses. Nevertheless, in the long run all
\par these things are nothing else than the belittlement of the entire type
\par "man," his mediocrisation, if in such a desperate situation I may make
\par use of such a desperate expression. I think that the commedia umana for
\par an epicurean spectator-god must consist in this: that the Europeans, by
\par virtue of their growing morality, believe in all their innocence and
\par vanity that they are rising higher and higher, whereas the truth is
\par that they are sinking lower and lower--i.e. through the cultivation of
\par all the virtues which are useful to a herd, and through the repression
\par of the other and contrary virtues which give rise to a new, higher,
\par stronger, masterful race of men--the first-named virtues merely develop
\par the herd-animal in man and stabilitate the animal "man," for until now
\par man has been "the animal as yet unstabilitated."
\par 
\par 
\par 26.
\par 
\par Genius and Epoch.--Heroism is no form of selfishness, for one is
\par shipwrecked by it.... The direction of power is often conditioned by
\par the state of the period in which the great man happens to be born; and
\par this fact brings about the superstition that he is the expression of
\par his time. But this same power could be applied in several different
\par ways; and between him and his time there is always this difference:
\par that public opinion always worships the herd instinct,--_i.e._ the
\par instinct of the weak,--while he, the strong man, rights for strong
\par ideals.
\par 
\par 
\par 27.
\par 
\par The fate now overhanging Europe is simply this: that it is exactly
\par her strongest sons that come rarely and late to the spring-time of
\par their existence; that, as a rule, when they are already in their early
\par youth they perish, saddened, disgusted, darkened in mind, just because
\par they have already, with the entire passion of their strength, drained
\par to the dregs the cup of disillusionment, which in our days means the
\par cup of knowledge, and they would not have been the strongest had
\par they not also been the most disillusionised. For that is the test of
\par their power--they must first of all rise out of the illness of their
\par epoch to reach their own health. A late spring-time is their mark of
\par distinction; also, let us add, late merriment, late folly, the late
\par exuberance of joy! For this is the danger of to-day: everything that we
\par loved when we were young has betrayed us. Our last love--the love which
\par makes us acknowledge her, our love for Truth--let us take care that
