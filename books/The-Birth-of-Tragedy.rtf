\par personal question,--in proof thereof observe the time in which it
\par originated, _in spite_ of which it originated, the exciting period
\par of the Franco-German war of 1870-71. While the thunder of the battle
\par of W\'f6rth rolled over Europe, the ruminator and riddle-lover, who had
\par to be the parent of this book, sat somewhere in a nook of the Alps,
\par lost in riddles and ruminations, consequently very much concerned and
\par unconcerned at the same time, and wrote down his meditations on the
\par _Greeks,_--the kernel of the curious and almost inaccessible book, to
\par which this belated prologue (or epilogue) is to be devoted. A few weeks
\par later: and he found himself under the walls of Metz, still wrestling
\par with the notes of interrogation he had set down concerning the alleged
\par "cheerfulness" of the Greeks and of Greek art; till at last, in that
\par month of deep suspense, when peace was debated at Versailles, he too
\par attained to peace with himself, and, slowly recovering from a disease
\par brought home from the field, made up his mind definitely regarding the
\par "Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of _Music."_--From music? Music and
\par Tragedy? Greeks and tragic music? Greeks and the Art-work of pessimism?
\par A race of men, well-fashioned, beautiful, envied, life-inspiring, like
\par no other race hitherto, the Greeks--indeed? The Greeks were _in need_
\par of tragedy? Yea--of art? Wherefore--Greek art?...
\par 
\par We can thus guess where the great note of interrogation concerning the
\par value of existence had been set. Is pessimism _necessarily_ the sign of
\par decline, of decay, of failure, of exhausted and weakened instincts?--as
\par was the case with the Indians, as is, to all appearance, the case with
\par us "modern" men and Europeans? Is there a pessimism of _strength_? An
\par intellectual predilection for what is hard, awful, evil, problematical
\par in existence, owing to well-being, to exuberant health, to _fullness_
\par of existence? Is there perhaps suffering in overfullness itself? A
\par seductive fortitude with the keenest of glances, which _yearns_ for
\par the terrible, as for the enemy, the worthy enemy, with whom it may try
\par its strength? from whom it is willing to learn what "fear" is? What
\par means _tragic_ myth to the Greeks of the best, strongest, bravest era?
\par And the prodigious phenomenon of the Dionysian? And that which was
\par born thereof, tragedy?--And again: that of which tragedy died, the
\par Socratism of morality, the dialectics, contentedness and cheerfulness
\par of the theoretical man--indeed? might not this very Socratism
\par be a sign of decline, of weariness, of disease, of anarchically
\par disintegrating instincts? And the "Hellenic cheerfulness" of the later
\par Hellenism merely a glowing sunset? The Epicurean will _counter_ to
\par pessimism merely a precaution of the sufferer? And science itself,
\par our science--ay, viewed as a symptom of life, what really signifies
\par all science? Whither, worse still, _whence_--all science? Well? Is
\par scientism perhaps only fear and evasion of pessimism? A subtle defence
\par against--_truth!_ Morally speaking, something like falsehood and
\par cowardice? And, unmorally speaking, an artifice? O Socrates, Socrates,
\par was this perhaps _thy_ secret? Oh mysterious ironist, was this perhaps
\par thine--irony?...
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 2.
\par 
\par 
\par What I then laid hands on, something terrible and dangerous, a
\par problem with horns, not necessarily a bull itself, but at all events
\par a _new_ problem: I should say to-day it was the _problem of science_
\par itself--science conceived for the first time as problematic, as
\par questionable. But the book, in which my youthful ardour and suspicion
\par then discharged themselves--what an _impossible_ book must needs
\par grow out of a task so disagreeable to youth. Constructed of nought
\par but precocious, unripened self-experiences, all of which lay close
\par to the threshold of the communicable, based on the groundwork of
\par _art_--for the problem of science cannot be discerned on the groundwork
\par of science,--a book perhaps for artists, with collateral analytical
\par and retrospective aptitudes (that is, an exceptional kind of artists,
\par for whom one must seek and does not even care to seek ...), full of
\par psychological innovations and artists' secrets, with an artists'
\par metaphysics in the background, a work of youth, full of youth's mettle
\par and youth's melancholy, independent, defiantly self-sufficient even
\par when it seems to bow to some authority and self-veneration; in short,
\par a firstling-work, even in every bad sense of the term; in spite of its
\par senile problem, affected with every fault of youth, above all with
\par youth's prolixity and youth's "storm and stress": on the other hand,
\par in view of the success it had (especially with the great artist to
\par whom it addressed itself, as it were, in a duologue, Richard Wagner) a
\par _demonstrated_ book, I mean a book which, at any rate, sufficed "for
\par the best of its time." On this account, if for no other reason, it
\par should be treated with some consideration and reserve; yet I shall not
\par altogether conceal how disagreeable it now appears to me, how after
\par sixteen years it stands a total stranger before me,--before an eye
\par which is more mature, and a hundred times more fastidious, but which
\par has by no means grown colder nor lost any of its interest in that
\par self-same task essayed for the first time by this daring book,--_to
\par view science through the optics of the artist, and art moreover through
\par the optics of life...._
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 3.
\par 
\par 
\par I say again, to-day it is an impossible book to me,--I call it badly
\par written, heavy, painful, image-angling and image-entangling, maudlin,
\par sugared at times even to femininism, uneven in tempo, void of the will
\par to logical cleanliness, very convinced and therefore rising above the
\par necessity of demonstration, distrustful even of the _propriety_ of
\par demonstration, as being a book for initiates, as "music" for those who
\par are baptised with the name of Music, who are united from the beginning
\par of things by common ties of rare experiences in art, as a countersign
\par for blood-relations _in artibus._--a haughty and fantastic book,
\par which from the very first withdraws even more from the _profanum
\par vulgus_ of the "cultured" than from the "people," but which also, as
\par its effect has shown and still shows, knows very well how to seek
\par fellow-enthusiasts and lure them to new by-ways and dancing-grounds.
\par Here, at any rate--thus much was acknowledged with curiosity as well
\par as with aversion--a _strange_ voice spoke, the disciple of a still
\par "unknown God," who for the time being had hidden himself under the
\par hood of the scholar, under the German's gravity and disinclination for
\par dialectics, even under the bad manners of the Wagnerian; here was a
\par spirit with strange and still nameless needs, a memory bristling with
\par questions, experiences and obscurities, beside which stood the name
\par Dionysos like one more note of interrogation; here spoke--people said
\par to themselves with misgivings--something like a mystic and almost
\par m\'e6nadic soul, which, undecided whether it should disclose or conceal
\par itself, stammers with an effort and capriciously as in a strange
\par tongue. It should have _sung,_ this "new soul"--and not spoken! What
\par a pity, that I did not dare to say what I then had to say, as a poet:
\par I could have done so perhaps! Or at least as a philologist:--for even
\par at the present day well-nigh everything in this domain remains to be
\par discovered and disinterred by the philologist! Above all the problem,
\par _that_ here there _is_ a problem before us,--and that, so long as we
\par have no answer to the question "what is Dionysian?" the Greeks are now
\par as ever wholly unknown and inconceivable....
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 4.
\par 
\par 
\par Ay, what is Dionysian?--In this book may be found an answer,--a
\par "knowing one" speaks here, the votary and disciple of his god.
\par Perhaps I should now speak more guardedly and less eloquently of a
\par psychological question so difficult as the origin of tragedy among the
\par Greeks. A fundamental question is the relation of the Greek to pain,
\par his degree of sensibility,--did this relation remain constant? or did
\par it veer about?--the question, whether his ever-increasing _longing
\par for beauty,_ for festivals, gaieties, new cults, did really grow out
\par of want, privation, melancholy, pain? For suppose even this to be
\par true--and Pericles (or Thucydides) intimates as much in the great
\par Funeral Speech:--whence then the opposite longing, which appeared
\par first in the order of time, the _longing for the ugly_, the good,
\par resolute desire of the Old Hellene for pessimism, for tragic myth, for
\par the picture of all that is terrible, evil, enigmatical, destructive,
\par fatal at the basis of existence,--whence then must tragedy have
\par sprung? Perhaps from _joy,_ from strength, from exuberant health, from
\par over-fullness. And what then, physiologically speaking, is the meaning
\par of that madness, out of which comic as well as tragic art has grown,
\par the Dionysian madness? What? perhaps madness is not necessarily the
\par symptom of degeneration, of decline, of belated culture? Perhaps there
\par are--a question for alienists--neuroses of _health_? of folk-youth
\par and youthfulness? What does that synthesis of god and goat in the
\par Satyr point to? What self-experience what "stress," made the Greek
\par think of the Dionysian reveller and primitive man as a satyr? And as
\par regards the origin of the tragic chorus: perhaps there were endemic
\par ecstasies in the eras when the Greek body bloomed and the Greek soul
\par brimmed over with life? Visions and hallucinations, which took hold
\par of entire communities, entire cult-assemblies? What if the Greeks
\par in the very wealth of their youth had the will _to be_ tragic and
\par were pessimists? What if it was madness itself, to use a word of
\par Plato's, which brought the _greatest_ blessings upon Hellas? And
\par what if, on the other hand and conversely, at the very time of their
\par dissolution and weakness, the Greeks became always more optimistic,
\par more superficial, more histrionic, also more ardent for logic and
\par the logicising of the world,--consequently at the same time more
\par "cheerful" and more "scientific"? Ay, despite all "modern ideas" and
\par prejudices of the democratic taste, may not the triumph of _optimism,_
\par the _common sense_ that has gained the upper hand, the practical and
\par theoretical _utilitarianism,_ like democracy itself, with which it is
\par synchronous--be symptomatic of declining vigour, of approaching age,
\par of physiological weariness? And _not_ at all--pessimism? Was Epicurus
\par an optimist--because a _sufferer_?... We see it is a whole bundle of
\par weighty questions which this book has taken upon itself,--let us not
\par fail to add its weightiest question! Viewed through the optics of
\par _life,_ what is the meaning of--morality?...
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 5.
\par 
\par 
\par Already in the foreword to Richard Wagner, art---and _not_ morality--is
\par set down as the properly _metaphysical_ activity of man; in the
\par book itself the piquant proposition recurs time and again, that the
\par existence of the world is _justified_ only as an \'e6sthetic phenomenon.
\par Indeed, the entire book recognises only an artist-thought and
\par artist-after-thought behind all occurrences,--a "God," if you will,
\par but certainly only an altogether thoughtless and unmoral artist-God,
\par who, in construction as in destruction, in good as in evil, desires
\par to become conscious of his own equable joy and sovereign glory; who,
\par in creating worlds, frees himself from the _anguish_ of fullness
\par and _overfullness,_ from the _suffering_ of the contradictions
\par concentrated within him. The world, that is, the redemption of God
\par _attained_ at every moment, as the perpetually changing, perpetually
\par new vision of the most suffering, most antithetical, most contradictory
\par being, who contrives to redeem himself only in _appearance:_ this
\par entire artist-metaphysics, call it arbitrary, idle, fantastic, if
\par you will,--the point is, that it already betrays a spirit, which is
\par determined some day, at all hazards, to make a stand against the
\par _moral_ interpretation and significance of life. Here, perhaps for the
\par first time, a pessimism "Beyond Good and Evil" announces itself, here
\par that "perverseness of disposition" obtains expression and formulation,
\par against which Schopenhauer never grew tired of hurling beforehand his
\par angriest imprecations and thunderbolts,--a philosophy which dares to
\par put, derogatorily put, morality itself in the world of phenomena, and
\par not only among "phenomena" (in the sense of the idealistic _terminus
\par technicus_), but among the "illusions," as appearance, semblance,
\par error, interpretation, accommodation, art. Perhaps the depth of this
\par _antimoral_ tendency may be best estimated from the guarded and
\par hostile silence with which Christianity is treated throughout this
\par book,--Christianity, as being the most extravagant burlesque of the
\par moral theme to which mankind has hitherto been obliged to listen. In
\par fact, to the purely \'e6sthetic world-interpretation and justification
\par taught in this book, there is no greater antithesis than the Christian
\par dogma, which is _only_ and will be only moral, and which, with
\par its absolute standards, for instance, its truthfulness of God,
\par relegates--that is, disowns, convicts, condemns--art, _all_ art, to
\par the realm of _falsehood._ Behind such a mode of thought and valuation,
\par which, if at all genuine, must be hostile to art, I always experienced
\par what was _hostile to life,_ the wrathful, vindictive counterwill to
\par life itself: for all life rests on appearance, art, illusion, optics,
\par necessity of perspective and error. From the very first Christianity
\par was, essentially and thoroughly, the nausea and surfeit of Life for
\par Life, which only disguised, concealed and decked itself out under the
\par belief in "another" or "better" life. The hatred of the "world," the
\par curse on the affections, the fear of beauty and sensuality, another
\par world, invented for the purpose of slandering this world the more,
\par at bottom a longing for. Nothingness, for the end, for rest, for the
\par "Sabbath of Sabbaths"--all this, as also the unconditional will of
\par Christianity to recognise _only_ moral values, has always appeared to
\par me as the most dangerous and ominous of all possible forms of a "will
\par to perish"; at the least, as the symptom of a most fatal disease, of
\par profoundest weariness, despondency, exhaustion, impoverishment of
\par life,--for before the tribunal of morality (especially Christian, that
\par is, unconditional morality) life _must_ constantly and inevitably be
\par the loser, because life _is_ something essentially unmoral,--indeed,
\par oppressed with the weight of contempt and the everlasting No, life
\par _must_ finally be regarded as unworthy of desire, as in itself
\par unworthy. Morality itself what?--may not morality be a "will to
\par disown life," a secret instinct for annihilation, a principle of
\par decay, of depreciation, of slander, a beginning of the end? And,
\par consequently, the danger of dangers?... It was _against_ morality,
\par therefore, that my instinct, as an intercessory-instinct for life,
\par turned in this questionable book, inventing for itself a fundamental
\par counter--dogma and counter-valuation of life, purely artistic, purely
\par _anti-Christian._ What should I call it? As a philologist and man of
\par words I baptised it, not without some liberty--for who could be sure
\par of the proper name of the Antichrist?--with the name of a Greek god: I
\par called it _Dionysian._
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 6.
\par 
\par 
\par You see which problem I ventured to touch upon in this early work?...
\par How I now regret, that I had not then the courage (or immodesty?) to
\par allow myself, in all respects, the use of an _individual language_
\par for such _individual_ contemplations and ventures in the field of
\par thought--that I laboured to express, in Kantian and Schopenhauerian
\par formul\'e6, strange and new valuations, which ran fundamentally counter
\par to the spirit of Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as to their taste!
\par What, forsooth, were Schopenhauer's views on tragedy? "What gives"--he
\par says in _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ II. 495--"to all tragedy
\par that singular swing towards elevation, is the awakening of the
\par knowledge that the world, that life, cannot satisfy us thoroughly,
\par and consequently is _not worthy_ of our attachment In this consists
\par the tragic spirit: it therefore leads to _resignation_." Oh, how
\par differently Dionysos spoke to me! Oh how far from me then was just
\par this entire resignationism!--But there is something far worse in this
\par book, which I now regret even more than having obscured and spoiled
\par Dionysian anticipations with Schopenhauerian formul\'e6: to wit, that, in
\par general, I _spoiled_ the grand _Hellenic problem,_ as it had opened
\par up before me, by the admixture of the most modern things! That I
\par entertained hopes, where nothing was to be hoped for, where everything
\par pointed all-too-clearly to an approaching end! That, on the basis of
\par our latter-day German music, I began to fable about the "spirit of
\par Teutonism," as if it were on the point of discovering and returning
\par to itself,--ay, at the very time that the German spirit which not so
\par very long before had had the will to the lordship over Europe, the
\par strength to lead and govern Europe, testamentarily and conclusively
\par _resigned_ and, under the pompous pretence of empire-founding,
\par effected its transition to mediocritisation, democracy, and "modern
\par ideas." In very fact, I have since learned to regard this "spirit of
\par Teutonism" as something to be despaired of and unsparingly treated,
\par as also our present _German music,_ which is Romanticism through and
\par through and the most un-Grecian of all possible forms of art: and
\par moreover a first-rate nerve-destroyer, doubly dangerous for a people
\par given to drinking and revering the unclear as a virtue, namely, in
\par its twofold capacity of an intoxicating and stupefying narcotic. Of
\par course, apart from all precipitate hopes and faulty applications to
\par matters specially modern, with which I then spoiled my first book, the
\par great Dionysian note of interrogation, as set down therein, continues
\par standing on and on, even with reference to music: how must we conceive
\par of a music, which is no longer of Romantic origin, like the German; but
\par of _Dionysian_?...
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 7.
\par 
\par 
\par --But, my dear Sir, if _your_ book is not Romanticism, what in
\par the world is? Can the deep hatred of the present, of "reality"
\par and "modern ideas" be pushed farther than has been done in your
\par artist-metaphysics?--which would rather believe in Nothing, or in
\par the devil, than in the "Now"? Does not a radical bass of wrath and
\par annihilative pleasure growl on beneath all your contrapuntal vocal
\par art and aural seduction, a mad determination to oppose all that "now"
\par is, a will which is not so very far removed from practical nihilism
\par and which seems to say: "rather let nothing be true, than that _you_
\par should be in the right, than that _your_ truth should prevail!"
\par Hear, yourself, my dear Sir Pessimist and art-deifier, with ever
\par so unlocked ears, a single select passage of your own book, that
\par not ineloquent dragon-slayer passage, which may sound insidiously
\par rat-charming to young ears and hearts. What? is not that the true
\par blue romanticist-confession of 1830 under the mask of the pessimism
\par of 1850? After which, of course, the usual romanticist finale at once
\par strikes up,--rupture, collapse, return and prostration before an old
\par belief, before _the_ old God.... What? is not your pessimist book
\par itself a piece of anti-Hellenism and Romanticism, something "equally
\par intoxicating and befogging," a narcotic at all events, ay, a piece of
\par music, of _German_ music? But listen:
\par 
\par     Let us imagine a rising generation with this undauntedness
\par     of vision, with this heroic impulse towards the prodigious,
\par     let us imagine the bold step of these dragon-slayers,
\par     the proud daring with which they turn their backs on all
\par     the effeminate doctrines of optimism, in order "to live
\par     resolutely" in the Whole and in the Full: _would it not be
\par     necessary_ for the tragic man of this culture, with his
\par     self-discipline to earnestness and terror, to desire a new
\par     art, _the art of metaphysical comfort,_ tragedy as the
\par     Helena belonging to him, and that he should exclaim with
\par     Faust:
\par 
\par         "Und sollt ich nicht, sehns\'fcchtigster Gewalt,
\par         In's Leben ziehn die einzigste Gestalt?"[1]
\par 
\par 
\par "Would it not be _necessary_?" ... No, thrice no! ye young
\par romanticists: it would _not_ be necessary! But it is very probable,
\par that things may _end_ thus, that _ye_ may end thus, namely "comforted,"
\par as it is written, in spite of all self-discipline to earnestness and
\par terror; metaphysically comforted, in short, as Romanticists are wont to
\par end, as _Christians...._ No! ye should first of all learn the art of
\par earthly comfort, ye should learn to _laugh,_ my young friends, if ye
\par are at all determined to remain pessimists: if so, you will perhaps,
\par as laughing ones, eventually send all metaphysical comfortism to the
\par devil--and metaphysics first of all! Or, to say it in the language of
\par that Dionysian ogre, called _Zarathustra_:
\par 
\par     "Lift up your hearts, my brethren, high, higher! And do
\par     not forget your legs! Lift up also your legs, ye good
\par     dancers--and better still if ye stand also on your heads!
\par 
\par     "This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown--I
\par     myself have put on this crown; I myself have consecrated my
\par     laughter. No one else have I found to-day strong enough for
\par     this.
\par 
\par     "Zarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one,
\par     who beckoneth with his pinions, one ready for flight,
\par     beckoning unto all birds, ready and prepared, a blissfully
\par     light-spirited one:--
\par 
\par     "Zarathustra the soothsayer, Zarathustra the sooth-laugher,
\par     no impatient one, no absolute one, one who loveth leaps and
\par     side-leaps: I myself have put on this crown!
\par 
\par     "This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown--to
\par     you my brethren do I cast this crown! Laughing have I
\par     consecrated: ye higher men, _learn,_ I pray you--to laugh!"

\par 
\par 
\par FOREWORD TO RICHARD WAGNER.
\par 
\par 
\par In order to keep at a distance all the possible scruples, excitements,
\par and misunderstandings to which the thoughts gathered in this essay
\par will give occasion, considering the peculiar character of our \'e6sthetic
\par publicity, and to be able also Co write the introductory remarks
\par with the same contemplative delight, the impress of which, as the
\par petrifaction of good and elevating hours, it bears on every page, I
\par form a conception of the moment when you, my highly honoured friend,
\par will receive this essay; how you, say after an evening walk in the
\par winter snow, will behold the unbound Prometheus on the title-page,
\par read my name, and be forthwith convinced that, whatever this essay may
\par contain, the author has something earnest and impressive to say, and,
\par moreover, that in all his meditations he communed with you as with one
\par present and could thus write only what befitted your presence. You
\par will thus remember that it was at the same time as your magnificent
\par dissertation on Beethoven originated, viz., amidst the horrors and
\par sublimities of the war which had just then broken out, that I collected
\par myself for these thoughts. But those persons would err, to whom this
\par collection suggests no more perhaps than the antithesis of patriotic
\par excitement and \'e6sthetic revelry, of gallant earnestness and sportive
\par delight. Upon a real perusal of this essay, such readers will, rather
\par to their surprise, discover how earnest is the German problem we have
\par to deal with, which we properly place, as a vortex and turning-point,
\par in the very midst of German hopes. Perhaps, however, this same class
\par of readers will be shocked at seeing an \'e6sthetic problem taken so
\par seriously, especially if they can recognise in art no more than a merry
\par diversion, a readily dispensable court-jester to the "earnestness
\par of existence": as if no one were aware of the real meaning of this
\par confrontation with the "earnestness of existence." These earnest ones
\par may be informed that I am convinced that art is the highest task and
\par the properly metaphysical activity of this life, as it is understood by
\par the man, to whom, as my sublime protagonist on this path, I would now
\par dedicate this essay.
\par 
\par BASEL, _end of the year_ 1871.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 1.
\par 
\par 
\par We shall have gained much for the science of \'e6sthetics, when once we
\par have perceived not only by logical inference, but by the immediate
\par certainty of intuition, that the continuous development of art is bound
\par up with the duplexity of the _Apollonian_ and the _Dionysian:_ in
\par like manner as procreation is dependent on the duality of the sexes,
\par involving perpetual conflicts with only periodically intervening
\par reconciliations. These names we borrow from the Greeks, who disclose
\par to the intelligent observer the profound mysteries of their view of
\par art, not indeed in concepts, but in the impressively clear figures of
\par their world of deities. It is in connection with Apollo and Dionysus,
\par the two art-deities of the Greeks, that we learn that there existed in
\par the Grecian world a wide antithesis, in origin and aims, between the
\par art of the shaper, the Apollonian, and the non-plastic art of music,
\par that of Dionysus: both these so heterogeneous tendencies run parallel
\par to each other, for the most part openly at variance, and continually
\par inciting each other to new and more powerful births, to perpetuate in
\par them the strife of this antithesis, which is but seemingly bridged over
\par by their mutual term "Art"; till at last, by a metaphysical miracle
\par of the Hellenic will, they appear paired with each other, and through
\par this pairing eventually generate the equally Dionysian and Apollonian
\par art-work of Attic tragedy.
\par 
\par In order to bring these two tendencies within closer range, let us
\par conceive them first of all as the separate art-worlds of _dreamland_
\par and _drunkenness;_ between which physiological phenomena a contrast
\par may be observed analogous to that existing between the Apollonian and
\par the Dionysian. In dreams, according to the conception of Lucretius,
\par the glorious divine figures first appeared to the souls of men, in
\par dreams the great shaper beheld the charming corporeal structure of
\par superhuman beings, and the Hellenic poet, if consulted on the mysteries
\par of poetic inspiration, would likewise have suggested dreams and would
\par have offered an explanation resembling that of Hans Sachs in the
\par Meistersingers:--
\par 
\par     Mein Freund, das grad' ist Dichters Werk,
\par     dass er sein Tr\'e4umen deut' und merk'.
\par     Glaubt mir, des Menschen wahrster Wahn
\par     wird ihm im Traume aufgethan:
\par     all' Dichtkunst und Poeterei
\par     ist nichts als Wahrtraum-Deuterei.[1]
\par 
\par 
\par The beauteous appearance of the dream-worlds, in the production of
\par which every man is a perfect artist, is the presupposition of all
\par plastic art, and in fact, as we shall see, of an important half of
\par poetry also. We take delight in the immediate apprehension of form; all
\par forms speak to us; there is nothing indifferent, nothing superfluous.
\par But, together with the highest life of this dream-reality we also have,
\par glimmering through it, the sensation of its appearance: such at least
\par is my experience, as to the frequency, ay, normality of which I could
\par adduce many proofs, as also the sayings of the poets. Indeed, the man
\par of philosophic turn has a foreboding that underneath this reality in
\par which we live and have our being, another and altogether different
\par reality lies concealed, and that therefore it is also an appearance;
\par and Schopenhauer actually designates the gift of occasionally regarding
\par men and things as mere phantoms and dream-pictures as the criterion of
\par philosophical ability. Accordingly, the man susceptible to art stands
\par in the same relation to the reality of dreams as the philosopher to
\par the reality of existence; he is a close and willing observer, for from
\par these pictures he reads the meaning of life, and by these processes
\par he trains himself for life. And it is perhaps not only the agreeable
\par and friendly pictures that he realises in himself with such perfect
\par understanding: the earnest, the troubled, the dreary, the gloomy, the
\par sudden checks, the tricks of fortune, the uneasy presentiments, in
\par short, the whole "Divine Comedy" of life, and the Inferno, also pass
\par before him, not merely like pictures on the wall--for he too lives and
\par suffers in these scenes,--and yet not without that fleeting sensation
\par of appearance. And perhaps many a one will, like myself, recollect
\par having sometimes called out cheeringly and not without success amid the
\par dangers and terrors of dream-life: "It is a dream! I will dream on!" I
\par have likewise been told of persons capable of continuing the causality
\par of one and the same dream for three and even more successive nights:
\par all of which facts clearly testify that our innermost being, the common
\par substratum of all of us, experiences our dreams with deep joy and
\par cheerful acquiescence.
\par 
\par This cheerful acquiescence in the dream-experience has likewise been
\par embodied by the Greeks in their Apollo: for Apollo, as the god of
\par all shaping energies, is also the soothsaying god. He, who (as the
\par etymology of the name indicates) is the "shining one," the deity of
\par light, also rules over the fair appearance of the inner world of
\par fantasies. The higher truth, the perfection of these states in contrast
\par to the only partially intelligible everyday world, ay, the deep
\par consciousness of nature, healing and helping in sleep and dream, is at
\par the same time the symbolical analogue of the faculty of soothsaying
\par and, in general, of the arts, through which life is made possible and
\par worth living. But also that delicate line, which the dream-picture must
\par not overstep--lest it act pathologically (in which case appearance,
\par being reality pure and simple, would impose upon us)--must not be
\par wanting in the picture of Apollo: that measured limitation, that
\par freedom from the wilder emotions, that philosophical calmness of the
\par sculptor-god. His eye must be "sunlike," according to his origin; even
\par when it is angry and looks displeased, the sacredness of his beauteous
\par appearance is still there. And so we might apply to Apollo, in an
\par eccentric sense, what Schopenhauer says of the man wrapt in the veil
\par of M\'e2y\'e2[2]: _Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. p. 416: "Just as in
\par a stormy sea, unbounded in every direction, rising and falling with
\par howling mountainous waves, a sailor sits in a boat and trusts in his
\par frail barque: so in the midst of a world of sorrows the individual sits
\par quietly supported by and trusting in his _principium individuationis_."
\par Indeed, we might say of Apollo, that in him the unshaken faith in
\par this _principium_ and the quiet sitting of the man wrapt therein have
\par received their sublimest expression; and we might even designate Apollo
\par as the glorious divine image of the _principium individuationis,_
\par from out of the gestures and looks of which all the joy and wisdom of
\par "appearance," together with its beauty, speak to us.
\par 
\par In the same work Schopenhauer has described to us the stupendous _awe_
\par which seizes upon man, when of a sudden he is at a loss to account for
\par the cognitive forms of a phenomenon, in that the principle of reason,
\par in some one of its manifestations, seems to admit of an exception.
\par Add to this awe the blissful ecstasy which rises from the innermost
\par depths of man, ay, of nature, at this same collapse of the _principium
\par individuationis,_ and we shall gain an insight into the being of
\par the _Dionysian,_ which is brought within closest ken perhaps by the
\par analogy of _drunkenness._ It is either under the influence of the
\par narcotic draught, of which the hymns of all primitive men and peoples
\par tell us, or by the powerful approach of spring penetrating all nature
\par with joy, that those Dionysian emotions awake, in the augmentation of
\par which the subjective vanishes to complete self-forgetfulness. So also
\par in the German Middle Ages singing and dancing crowds, ever increasing
\par in number, were borne from place to place under this same Dionysian
\par power. In these St. John's and St. Vitus's dancers we again perceive
\par the Bacchic choruses of the Greeks, with their previous history in Asia
\par Minor, as far back as Babylon and the orgiastic Sac\'e6a. There are some,
\par who, from lack of experience or obtuseness, will turn away from such
\par phenomena as "folk-diseases" with a smile of contempt or pity prompted
\par by the consciousness of their own health: of course, the poor wretches
\par do not divine what a cadaverous-looking and ghastly aspect this very
\par "health" of theirs presents when the glowing life of the Dionysian
\par revellers rushes past them.
\par 
\par Under the charm of the Dionysian not only is the covenant between man
\par and man again established, but also estranged, hostile or subjugated
\par nature again celebrates her reconciliation with her lost son, man. Of
\par her own accord earth proffers her gifts, and peacefully the beasts of
\par prey approach from the desert and the rocks. The chariot of Dionysus is
\par bedecked with flowers and garlands: panthers and tigers pass beneath
\par his yoke. Change Beethoven's "jubilee-song" into a painting, and, if
\par your imagination be equal to the occasion when the awestruck millions
\par sink into the dust, you will then be able to approach the Dionysian.
\par Now is the slave a free man, now all the stubborn, hostile barriers,
\par which necessity, caprice, or "shameless fashion" has set up between
\par man and man, are broken down. Now, at the evangel of cosmic harmony,
\par each one feels himself not only united, reconciled, blended with
\par his neighbour, but as one with him, as if the veil of M\'e2y\'e2 has been
\par torn and were now merely fluttering in tatters before the mysterious
\par Primordial Unity. In song and in dance man exhibits himself as a member
\par of a higher community, has forgotten how to walk and speak, and is on
\par the point of taking a dancing flight into the air. His gestures bespeak
\par enchantment. Even as the animals now talk, and as the earth yields milk
\par and honey, so also something super-natural sounds forth from him: he
\par feels himself a god, he himself now walks about enchanted and elated
\par even as the gods whom he saw walking about in his dreams. Man is no
\par longer an artist, he has become a work of art: the artistic power of
\par all nature here reveals itself in the tremors of drunkenness to the
\par highest gratification of the Primordial Unity. The noblest clay, the
\par costliest marble, namely man, is here kneaded and cut, and the chisel
\par strokes of the Dionysian world-artist are accompanied with the cry of
\par the Eleusinian mysteries: "Ihr st\'fcrzt nieder, Millionen? Ahnest du den
\par Sch\'f6pfer, Welt?"[3]

\par 2.
\par 
\par 
\par Thus far we have considered the Apollonian and his antithesis,
\par the Dionysian, as artistic powers, which burst forth from nature
\par herself, _without the mediation of the human artist,_ and in which
\par her art-impulses are satisfied in the most immediate and direct way:
\par first, as the pictorial world of dreams, the perfection of which
\par has no connection whatever with the intellectual height or artistic
\par culture of the unit man, and again, as drunken reality, which likewise
\par does not heed the unit man, but even seeks to destroy the individual
\par and redeem him by a mystic feeling of Oneness. Anent these immediate
\par art-states of nature every artist is either an "imitator," to wit,
\par either an Apollonian, an artist in dreams, or a Dionysian, an artist
\par in ecstasies, or finally--as for instance in Greek tragedy--an artist
\par in both dreams and ecstasies: so we may perhaps picture him, as in
\par his Dionysian drunkenness and mystical self-abnegation, lonesome and
\par apart from the revelling choruses, he sinks down, and how now, through
\par Apollonian dream-inspiration, his own state, _i.e._, his oneness
\par with the primal source of the universe, reveals itself to him _in a
\par symbolical dream-picture_.
\par 
\par After these general premisings and contrastings, let us now approach
\par the _Greeks_ in order to learn in what degree and to what height
\par these _art-impulses of nature_ were developed in them: whereby
\par we shall be enabled to understand and appreciate more deeply the
\par relation of the Greek artist to his archetypes, or, according to the
\par Aristotelian expression, "the imitation of nature." In spite of all the
\par dream-literature and the numerous dream-anecdotes of the Greeks, we can
\par speak only conjecturally, though with a fair degree of certainty, of
\par their _dreams._ Considering the incredibly precise and unerring plastic
\par power of their eyes, as also their manifest and sincere delight in
\par colours, we can hardly refrain (to the shame of every one born later)
\par from assuming for their very dreams a logical causality of lines and
\par contours, colours and groups, a sequence of scenes resembling their
\par best reliefs, the perfection of which would certainly justify us, if a
\par comparison were possible, in designating the dreaming Greeks as Homers
\par and Homer as a dreaming Greek: in a deeper sense than when modern man,
\par in respect to his dreams, ventures to compare himself with Shakespeare.
\par 
\par On the other hand, we should not have to speak conjecturally, if asked
\par to disclose the immense gap which separated the _Dionysian Greek_ from
\par the Dionysian barbarian. From all quarters of the Ancient World--to
\par say nothing of the modern--from Rome as far as Babylon, we can prove
\par the existence of Dionysian festivals, the type of which bears, at
\par best, the same relation to the Greek festivals as the bearded satyr,
\par who borrowed his name and attributes from the goat, does to Dionysus
\par himself. In nearly every instance the centre of these festivals lay
\par in extravagant sexual licentiousness, the waves of which overwhelmed
\par all family life and its venerable traditions; the very wildest beasts
\par of nature were let loose here, including that detestable mixture of
\par lust and cruelty which has always seemed to me the genuine "witches'
\par draught." For some time, however, it would seem that the Greeks
\par were perfectly secure and guarded against the feverish agitations
\par of these festivals (--the knowledge of which entered Greece by all
\par the channels of land and sea) by the figure of Apollo himself rising
\par here in full pride, who could not have held out the Gorgon's head to
\par a more dangerous power than this grotesquely uncouth Dionysian. It
\par is in Doric art that this majestically-rejecting attitude of Apollo
\par perpetuated itself. This opposition became more precarious and even
\par impossible, when, from out of the deepest root of the Hellenic nature,
\par similar impulses finally broke forth and made way for themselves:
\par the Delphic god, by a seasonably effected reconciliation, was now
\par contented with taking the destructive arms from the hands of his
\par powerful antagonist. This reconciliation marks the most important
\par moment in the history of the Greek cult: wherever we turn our eyes
\par we may observe the revolutions resulting from this event. It was
\par the reconciliation of two antagonists, with the sharp demarcation
\par of the boundary-lines to be thenceforth observed by each, and with
\par periodical transmission of testimonials;--in reality, the chasm was
\par not bridged over. But if we observe how, under the pressure of this
\par conclusion of peace, the Dionysian power manifested itself, we shall
\par now recognise in the Dionysian orgies of the Greeks, as compared with
\par the Babylonian Sac\'e6a and their retrogression of man to the tiger and
\par the ape, the significance of festivals of world-redemption and days of
\par transfiguration. Not till then does nature attain her artistic jubilee;
\par not till then does the rupture of the _principium individuationis_
\par become an artistic phenomenon. That horrible "witches' draught" of
\par sensuality and cruelty was here powerless: only the curious blending
\par and duality in the emotions of the Dionysian revellers reminds one of
\par it--just as medicines remind one of deadly poisons,--that phenomenon,
\par to wit, that pains beget joy, that jubilation wrings painful sounds out
\par of the breast. From the highest joy sounds the cry of horror or the
\par yearning wail over an irretrievable loss. In these Greek festivals a
\par sentimental trait, as it were, breaks forth from nature, as if she must
\par sigh over her dismemberment into individuals. The song and pantomime
\par of such dually-minded revellers was something new and unheard-of in
\par the Homeric-Grecian world; and the Dionysian _music_ in particular
\par excited awe and horror. If music, as it would seem, was previously
\par known as an Apollonian art, it was, strictly speaking, only as the
\par wave-beat of rhythm, the formative power of which was developed to
\par the representation of Apollonian conditions. The music of Apollo was
\par Doric architectonics in tones, but in merely suggested tones, such
\par as those of the cithara. The very element which forms the essence of
\par Dionysian music (and hence of music in general) is carefully excluded
\par as un-Apollonian; namely, the thrilling power of the tone, the uniform
\par stream of the melos, and the thoroughly incomparable world of harmony.
\par In the Dionysian dithyramb man is incited to the highest exaltation
\par of all his symbolic faculties; something never before experienced
\par struggles for utterance--the annihilation of the veil of M\'e2y\'e2, Oneness
\par as genius of the race, ay, of nature. The essence of nature is now
\par to be expressed symbolically; a new world of symbols is required;
\par for once the entire symbolism of the body, not only the symbolism of
\par the lips, face, and speech, but the whole pantomime of dancing which
\par sets all the members into rhythmical motion. Thereupon the other
\par symbolic powers, those of music, in rhythmics, dynamics, and harmony,
\par suddenly become impetuous. To comprehend this collective discharge
\par of all the symbolic powers, a man must have already attained that
\par height of self-abnegation, which wills to express itself symbolically
\par through these powers: the Dithyrambic votary of Dionysus is therefore
\par understood only by those like himself! With what astonishment must the
\par Apollonian Greek have beheld him! With an astonishment, which was all
\par the greater the more it was mingled with the shuddering suspicion that
\par all this was in reality not so very foreign to him, yea, that, like
\par unto a veil, his Apollonian consciousness only hid this Dionysian world
\par from his view.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 3.
\par 
\par 
\par In order to comprehend this, we must take down the artistic structure,
\par of the _Apollonian culture,_ as it were, stone by stone, till we behold
\par the foundations on which it rests. Here we observe first of all the
\par glorious _Olympian_ figures of the gods, standing on the gables of this
\par structure, whose deeds, represented in far-shining reliefs, adorn its
\par friezes. Though Apollo stands among them as an individual deity, side
\par by side with others, and without claim to priority of rank, we must not
\par suffer this fact to mislead us. The same impulse which embodied itself
\par in Apollo has, in general, given birth to this whole Olympian world,
\par and in this sense we may regard Apollo as the father thereof. What was
\par the enormous need from which proceeded such an illustrious group of
\par Olympian beings?
\par 
\par Whosoever, with another religion in his heart, approaches these
\par Olympians and seeks among them for moral elevation, even for sanctity,
\par for incorporeal spiritualisation, for sympathetic looks of love, will
\par soon be obliged to turn his back on them, discouraged and disappointed.
\par Here nothing suggests asceticism, spirituality, or duty: here only
\par an exuberant, even triumphant life speaks to us, in which everything
\par existing is deified, whether good or bad. And so the spectator will
\par perhaps stand quite bewildered before this fantastic exuberance of
\par life, and ask himself what magic potion these madly merry men could
\par have used for enjoying life, so that, wherever they turned their eyes,
\par Helena, the ideal image of their own existence "floating in sweet
\par sensuality," smiled upon them. But to this spectator, already turning
\par backwards, we must call out: "depart not hence, but hear rather what
\par Greek folk-wisdom says of this same life, which with such inexplicable
\par cheerfulness spreads out before thee." There is an ancient story that
\par king Midas hunted in the forest a long time for the wise _Silenus,_
\par the companion of Dionysus, without capturing him. When at last he fell
\par into his hands, the king asked what was best of all and most desirable
\par for man. Fixed and immovable, the demon remained silent; till at last,
\par forced by the king, he broke out with shrill laughter into these words:
\par "Oh, wretched race of a day, children of chance and misery, why do ye
\par compel me to say to you what it were most expedient for you not to
\par hear? What is best of all is for ever beyond your reach: not to be
\par born, not to _be_, to be _nothing._ The second best for you, however,
\par is soon to die."
\par 
\par How is the Olympian world of deities related to this folk-wisdom? Even
\par as the rapturous vision of the tortured martyr to his sufferings.
\par 
\par Now the Olympian magic mountain opens, as it were, to our view and
\par shows to us its roots. The Greek knew and felt the terrors and horrors
\par of existence: to be able to live at all, he had to interpose the
\par shining dream-birth of the Olympian world between himself and them.
\par The excessive distrust of the titanic powers of nature, the Moira
\par throning inexorably over all knowledge, the vulture of the great
\par philanthropist Prometheus, the terrible fate of the wise \'8cdipus, the
\par family curse of the Atrid\'e6 which drove Orestes to matricide; in short,
\par that entire philosophy of the sylvan god, with its mythical exemplars,
\par which wrought the ruin of the melancholy Etruscans--was again and again
\par surmounted anew by the Greeks through the artistic _middle world_ of
\par the Olympians, or at least veiled and withdrawn from sight. To be able
\par to live, the Greeks had, from direst necessity, to create these gods:
\par which process we may perhaps picture to ourselves in this manner: that
\par out of the original Titan thearchy of terror the Olympian thearchy of
\par joy was evolved, by slow transitions, through the Apollonian impulse to
\par beauty, even as roses break forth from thorny bushes. How else could
\par this so sensitive people, so vehement in its desires, so singularly
\par qualified for _sufferings_ have endured existence, if it had not been
\par exhibited to them in their gods, surrounded with a higher glory?
\par The same impulse which calls art into being, as the complement and
\par consummation of existence, seducing to a continuation of life, caused
\par also the Olympian world to arise, in which the Hellenic "will" held
\par up before itself a transfiguring mirror. Thus do the gods justify the
\par life of man, in that they themselves live it--the only satisfactory
\par Theodicy! Existence under the bright sunshine of such gods is regarded
\par as that which is desirable in itself, and the real _grief_ of the
\par Homeric men has reference to parting from it, especially to early
\par parting: so that we might now say of them, with a reversion of the
\par Silenian wisdom, that "to die early is worst of all for them, the
\par second worst is--some day to die at all." If once the lamentation is
\par heard, it will ring out again, of the short-lived Achilles, of the
\par leaf-like change and vicissitude of the human race, of the decay of
\par the heroic age. It is not unworthy of the greatest hero to long for a
\par continuation of life, ay, even as a day-labourer. So vehemently does
\par the "will," at the Apollonian stage of development, long for this
\par existence, so completely at one does the Homeric man feel himself with
\par it, that the very lamentation becomes its song of praise.
\par 
\par Here we must observe that this harmony which is so eagerly contemplated
\par by modern man, in fact, this oneness of man with nature, to express
\par which Schiller introduced the technical term "na\'efve," is by no means
\par such a simple, naturally resulting and, as it were, inevitable
\par condition, which _must_ be found at the gate of every culture leading
\par to a paradise of man: this could be believed only by an age which
\par sought to picture to itself Rousseau's \'c9mile also as an artist,
\par and imagined it had found in Homer such an artist \'c9mile, reared at
\par Nature's bosom. Wherever we meet with the "na\'efve" in art, it behoves
\par us to recognise the highest effect of the Apollonian culture, which
\par in the first place has always to overthrow some Titanic empire and
\par slay monsters, and which, through powerful dazzling representations
\par and pleasurable illusions, must have triumphed over a terrible depth
\par of world-contemplation and a most keen susceptibility to suffering.
\par But how seldom is the na\'efve--that complete absorption, in the beauty
\par of appearance--attained! And hence how inexpressibly sublime is
\par _Homer,_ who, as unit being, bears the same relation to this Apollonian
\par folk-culture as the unit dream-artist does to the dream-faculty of
\par the people and of Nature in general. The Homeric "na\'efvet\'e9" can be
\par comprehended only as the complete triumph of the Apollonian illusion:
\par it is the same kind of illusion as Nature so frequently employs to
\par compass her ends. The true goal is veiled by a phantasm: we stretch out
\par our hands for the latter, while Nature attains the former through our
\par illusion. In the Greeks the "will" desired to contemplate itself in the
\par transfiguration of the genius and the world of art; in order to glorify
\par themselves, its creatures had to feel themselves worthy of glory;
\par they had to behold themselves again in a higher sphere, without this
\par consummate world of contemplation acting as an imperative or reproach.
\par Such is the sphere of beauty, in which, as in a mirror, they saw their
\par images, the Olympians. With this mirroring of beauty the Hellenic will
\par combated its talent--correlative to the artistic--for suffering and for
\par the wisdom of suffering: and, as a monument of its victory, Homer, the
\par na\'efve artist, stands before us.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 4.
\par 
\par 
\par Concerning this na\'efve artist the analogy of dreams will enlighten us to
\par some extent. When we realise to ourselves the dreamer, as, in the midst
\par of the illusion of the dream-world and without disturbing it, he calls
\par out to himself: "it is a dream, I will dream on"; when we must thence
\par infer a deep inner joy in dream-contemplation; when, on the other hand,
\par to be at all able to dream with this inner joy in contemplation, we
\par must have completely forgotten the day and its terrible obtrusiveness,
\par we may, under the direction of the dream-reading Apollo, interpret
\par all these phenomena to ourselves somewhat as follows. Though it is
\par certain that of the two halves of life, the waking and the dreaming,
\par the former appeals to us as by far the more preferred, important,
\par excellent and worthy of being lived, indeed, as that which alone is
\par lived: yet, with reference to that mysterious ground of our being of
\par which we are the phenomenon, I should, paradoxical as it may seem, be
\par inclined to maintain the very opposite estimate of the value of dream
\par life. For the more clearly I perceive in nature those all-powerful art
\par impulses, and in them a fervent longing for appearance, for redemption
\par through appearance, the more I feel myself driven to the metaphysical
\par assumption that the Verily-Existent and Primordial Unity, as the
\par Eternally Suffering and Self-Contradictory, requires the rapturous
\par vision, the joyful appearance, for its continuous salvation: which
\par appearance we, who are completely wrapt in it and composed of it, must
\par regard as the Verily Non-existent,--_i.e.,_ as a perpetual unfolding
\par in time, space and causality,--in other words, as empiric reality.
\par If we therefore waive the consideration of our own "reality" for the
\par present, if we conceive our empiric existence, and that of the world
\par generally, as a representation of the Primordial Unity generated every
\par moment, we shall then have to regard the dream as an _appearance of
\par appearance,_ hence as a still higher gratification of the primordial
\par desire for appearance. It is for this same reason that the innermost
\par heart of Nature experiences that indescribable joy in the na\'efve artist
\par and in the na\'efve work of art, which is likewise only "an appearance of
\par appearance." In a symbolic painting, _Raphael_, himself one of these
\par immortal "na\'efve" ones, has represented to us this depotentiating of
\par appearance to appearance, the primordial process of the na\'efve artist
\par and at the same time of Apollonian culture. In his _Transfiguration,_
\par the lower half, with the possessed boy, the despairing bearers, the
\par helpless, terrified disciples, shows to us the reflection of eternal
\par primordial pain, the sole basis of the world: the "appearance" here
\par is the counter-appearance of eternal Contradiction, the father of
\par things. Out of this appearance then arises, like an ambrosial vapour, a
\par visionlike new world of appearances, of which those wrapt in the first
\par appearance see nothing--a radiant floating in purest bliss and painless
\par Contemplation beaming from wide-open eyes. Here there is presented to
\par our view, in the highest symbolism of art, that Apollonian world of
\par beauty and its substratum, the terrible wisdom of Silenus, and we
\par comprehend, by intuition, their necessary interdependence. Apollo,
\par however, again appears to us as the apotheosis of the _principium
\par individuationis,_ in which alone the perpetually attained end of the
\par Primordial Unity, its redemption through appearance, is consummated: he
\par shows us, with sublime attitudes, how the entire world of torment is
\par necessary, that thereby the individual may be impelled to realise the
\par redeeming vision, and then, sunk in contemplation thereof, quietly sit
\par in his fluctuating barque, in the midst of the sea.
\par 
\par This apotheosis of individuation, if it be at all conceived as
\par imperative and laying down precepts, knows but one law--the individual,
\par _i.e.,_ the observance of the boundaries of the individual,
\par _measure_ in the Hellenic sense. Apollo, as ethical deity, demands
\par due proportion of his disciples, and, that this may be observed, he
\par demands self-knowledge. And thus, parallel to the \'e6sthetic necessity
\par for beauty, there run the demands "know thyself" and "not too much,"
\par while presumption and undueness are regarded as the truly hostile
\par demons of the non-Apollonian sphere, hence as characteristics of the
\par pre-Apollonian age, that of the Titans, and of the extra-Apollonian
\par world, that of the barbarians. Because of his Titan-like love for
\par man, Prometheus had to be torn to pieces by vultures; because of his
\par excessive wisdom, which solved the riddle of the Sphinx, \'8cdipus had
\par to plunge into a bewildering vortex of monstrous crimes: thus did the
\par Delphic god interpret the Grecian past.
\par 
\par So also the effects wrought by the _Dionysian_ appeared "titanic" and
\par "barbaric" to the Apollonian Greek: while at the same time he could
\par not conceal from himself that he too was inwardly related to these
\par overthrown Titans and heroes. Indeed, he had to recognise still more
\par than this: his entire existence, with all its beauty and moderation,
\par rested on a hidden substratum of suffering and of knowledge, which
\par was again disclosed to him by the Dionysian. And lo! Apollo could not
\par live without Dionysus! The "titanic" and the "barbaric" were in the
\par end not less necessary than the Apollonian. And now let us imagine to
\par ourselves how the ecstatic tone of the Dionysian festival sounded in
\par ever more luring and bewitching strains into this artificially confined
\par world built on appearance and moderation, how in these strains all
\par the _undueness_ of nature, in joy, sorrow, and knowledge, even to
\par the transpiercing shriek, became audible: let us ask ourselves what
\par meaning could be attached to the psalmodising artist of Apollo, with
\par the phantom harp-sound, as compared with this demonic folk-song! The
\par muses of the arts of "appearance" paled before an art which, in its
\par intoxication, spoke the truth, the wisdom of Silenus cried "woe! woe!"
\par against the cheerful Olympians. The individual, with all his boundaries
\par and due proportions, went under in the self-oblivion of the Dionysian
\par states and forgot the Apollonian precepts. The _Undueness_ revealed
\par itself as truth, contradiction, the bliss born of pain, declared itself
\par but of the heart of nature. And thus, wherever the Dionysian prevailed,
\par the Apollonian was routed and annihilated. But it is quite as certain
\par that, where the first assault was successfully withstood, the authority
\par and majesty of the Delphic god exhibited itself as more rigid and
\par menacing than ever. For I can only explain to myself the _Doric_ state
\par and Doric art as a permanent war-camp of the Apollonian: only by
\par incessant opposition to the titanic-barbaric nature of the Dionysian
\par was it possible for an art so defiantly-prim, so encompassed with
\par bulwarks, a training so warlike and rigorous, a constitution so cruel
\par and relentless, to last for any length of time.
\par 
\par Up to this point we have enlarged upon the observation made at the
\par beginning of this essay: how the Dionysian and the Apollonian, in ever
\par new births succeeding and mutually augmenting one another, controlled
\par the Hellenic genius: how from out the age of "bronze," with its Titan
\par struggles and rigorous folk-philosophy, the Homeric world develops
\par under the fostering sway of the Apollonian impulse to beauty, how this
\par "na\'efve" splendour is again overwhelmed by the inbursting flood of the
\par Dionysian, and how against this new power the Apollonian rises to the
\par austere majesty of Doric art and the Doric view of things. If, then,
\par in this way, in the strife of these two hostile principles, the older
\par Hellenic history falls into four great periods of art, we are now
\par driven to inquire after the ulterior purpose of these unfoldings and
\par processes, unless perchance we should regard the last-attained period,
\par the period of Doric art, as the end and aim of these artistic impulses:
\par and here the sublime and highly celebrated art-work of _Attic tragedy_
\par and dramatic dithyramb presents itself to our view as the common
\par goal of both these impulses, whose mysterious union, after many and
\par long precursory struggles, found its glorious consummation in such a
\par child,--which is at once Antigone and Cassandra.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 5.
\par 
\par 
\par We now approach the real purpose of our investigation, which aims
\par at acquiring a knowledge of the Dionyso-Apollonian genius and his
\par art-work, or at least an anticipatory understanding of the mystery of
\par the aforesaid union. Here we shall ask first of all where that new
\par germ which subsequently developed into tragedy and dramatic dithyramb
\par first makes itself perceptible in the Hellenic world. The ancients
\par themselves supply the answer in symbolic form, when they place _Homer_
\par and _Archilochus_ as the forefathers and torch-bearers of Greek poetry
\par side by side on gems, sculptures, etc., in the sure conviction that
\par only these two thoroughly original compeers, from whom a stream of
\par fire flows over the whole of Greek posterity, should be taken into
\par consideration. Homer, the aged dreamer sunk in himself, the type
\par of the Apollonian na\'efve artist, beholds now with astonishment the
\par impassioned genius of the warlike votary of the muses, Archilochus,
\par violently tossed to and fro on the billows of existence: and modern
\par \'e6sthetics could only add by way of interpretation, that here the
\par "objective" artist is confronted by the first "subjective" artist.
\par But this interpretation is of little service to us, because we know
\par the subjective artist only as the poor artist, and in every type and
\par elevation of art we demand specially and first of all the conquest
\par of the Subjective, the redemption from the "ego" and the cessation
\par of every individual will and desire; indeed, we find it impossible
\par to believe in any truly artistic production, however insignificant,
\par without objectivity, without pure, interestless contemplation. Hence
\par our \'e6sthetics must first solve the problem as to how the "lyrist" is
\par possible as an artist: he who according to the experience of all ages
\par continually says "I" and sings off to us the entire chromatic scale of
\par his passions and desires. This very Archilochus appals us, alongside
\par of Homer, by his cries of hatred and scorn, by the drunken outbursts
\par of his desire. Is not just he then, who has been called the first
\par subjective artist, the non-artist proper? But whence then the reverence
\par which was shown to him--the poet--in very remarkable utterances by the
\par Delphic oracle itself, the focus of "objective" art?
\par 
\par _Schiller_ has enlightened us concerning his poetic procedure by a
\par psychological observation, inexplicable to himself, yet not apparently
\par open to any objection. He acknowledges that as the preparatory state
\par to the act of poetising he had not perhaps before him or within him a
\par series of pictures with co-ordinate causality of thoughts, but rather
\par a _musical mood_ ("The perception with me is at first without a clear
\par and definite object; this forms itself later. A certain musical mood
\par of mind precedes, and only after this does the poetical idea follow
\par with me.") Add to this the most important phenomenon of all ancient
\par lyric poetry, _the union,_ regarded everywhere as natural, _of the
\par lyrist with the musician,_ their very identity, indeed,--compared
\par with which our modern lyric poetry is like the statue of a god without
\par a head,--and we may now, on the basis of our metaphysics of \'e6sthetics
\par set forth above, interpret the lyrist to ourselves as follows. As
\par Dionysian artist he is in the first place become altogether one with
\par the Primordial Unity, its pain and contradiction, and he produces the
\par copy of this Primordial Unity as music, granting that music has been
\par correctly termed a repetition and a recast of the world; but now, under
\par the Apollonian dream-inspiration, this music again becomes visible
\par to him as in a _symbolic dream-picture._ The formless and intangible
\par reflection of the primordial pain in music, with its redemption in
\par appearance, then generates a second mirroring as a concrete symbol or
\par example. The artist has already surrendered his subjectivity in the
\par Dionysian process: the picture which now shows to him his oneness with
\par the heart of the world, is a dream-scene, which embodies the primordial
\par contradiction and primordial pain, together with the primordial joy, of
\par appearance. The "I" of the lyrist sounds therefore from the abyss of
\par being: its "subjectivity," in the sense of the modern \'e6sthetes, is a
\par fiction. When Archilochus, the first lyrist of the Greeks, makes known
\par both his mad love and his contempt to the daughters of Lycambes, it is
\par not his passion which dances before us in orgiastic frenzy: we see
\par Dionysus and the M\'e6nads, we see the drunken reveller Archilochus sunk
\par down to sleep--as Euripides depicts it in the Bacch\'e6, the sleep on the
\par high Alpine pasture, in the noonday sun:--and now Apollo approaches and
\par touches him with the laurel. The Dionyso-musical enchantment of the
\par sleeper now emits, as it were, picture sparks, lyrical poems, which in
\par their highest development are called tragedies and dramatic dithyrambs.
\par 
\par The plastic artist, as also the epic poet, who is related to him, is
\par sunk in the pure contemplation of pictures. The Dionysian musician
\par is, without any picture, himself just primordial pain and the
\par primordial re-echoing thereof. The lyric genius is conscious of a
\par world of pictures and symbols--growing out of the state of mystical
\par self-abnegation and oneness,--which has a colouring causality and
\par velocity quite different from that of the world of the plastic artist
\par and epic poet. While the latter lives in these pictures, and only in
\par them, with joyful satisfaction, and never grows tired of contemplating
\par them with love, even in their minutest characters, while even the
\par picture of the angry Achilles is to him but a picture, the angry
\par expression of which he enjoys with the dream-joy in appearance--so
\par that, by this mirror of appearance, he is guarded against being unified
\par and blending with his figures;--the pictures of the lyrist on the other
\par hand are nothing but _his very_ self and, as it were, only different
\par projections of himself, on account of which he as the moving centre
\par of this world is entitled to say "I": only of course this self is
\par not the same as that of the waking, empirically real man, but the
\par only verily existent and eternal self resting at the basis of things,
\par by means of the images whereof the lyric genius sees through even to
\par this basis of things. Now let us suppose that he beholds _himself_
\par also among these images as non-genius, _i.e.,_ his subject, the whole
\par throng of subjective passions and impulses of the will directed to a
\par definite object which appears real to him; if now it seems as if the
\par lyric genius and the allied non-genius were one, and as if the former
\par spoke that little word "I" of his own accord, this appearance will no
\par longer be able to lead us astray, as it certainly led those astray who
\par designated the lyrist as the subjective poet. In truth, Archilochus,
\par the passionately inflamed, loving and hating man, is but a vision of
\par the genius, who by this time is no longer Archilochus, but a genius
\par of the world, who expresses his primordial pain symbolically in the
\par figure of the man Archilochus: while the subjectively willing and
\par desiring man, Archilochus, can never at any time be a poet. It is by no
\par means necessary, however, that the lyrist should see nothing but the
\par phenomenon of the man Archilochus before him as a reflection of eternal
\par being; and tragedy shows how far the visionary world of the lyrist may
\par depart from this phenomenon, to which, of course, it is most intimately
\par related.
\par 
\par _Schopenhauer,_ who did not shut his eyes to the difficulty presented
\par by the lyrist in the philosophical contemplation of art, thought he
\par had found a way out of it, on which, however, I cannot accompany him;
\par while he alone, in his profound metaphysics of music, held in his
\par hands the means whereby this difficulty could be definitely removed:
\par as I believe I have removed it here in his spirit and to his honour.
\par In contrast to our view, he describes the peculiar nature of song
\par as follows[4] (_Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. 295):--"It is
\par the subject of the will, _i.e.,_ his own volition, which fills the
\par consciousness of the singer; often as an unbound and satisfied desire
\par (joy), but still more often as a restricted desire (grief), always as
\par an emotion, a passion, or an agitated frame of mind. Besides this,
\par however, and along with it, by the sight of surrounding nature, the
\par singer becomes conscious of himself as the subject of pure will-less
\par knowing, the unbroken, blissful peace of which now appears, in contrast
\par to the stress of desire, which is always restricted and always needy.
\par The feeling of this contrast, this alternation, is really what the
\par song as a whole expresses and what principally constitutes the lyrical
\par state of mind. In it pure knowing comes to us as it were to deliver us
\par from desire and the stress thereof: we follow, but only for an instant;
\par for desire, the remembrance of our personal ends, tears us anew from
\par peaceful contemplation; yet ever again the next beautiful surrounding
\par in which the pure will-less knowledge presents itself to us, allures
\par us away from desire. Therefore, in song and in the lyrical mood,
\par desire (the personal interest of the ends) and the pure perception of
\par the surrounding which presents itself, are wonderfully mingled with
\par each other; connections between them are sought for and imagined; the
\par subjective disposition, the affection of the will, imparts its own
\par hue to the contemplated surrounding, and conversely, the surroundings
\par communicate the reflex of their colour to the will. The true song is
\par the expression of the whole of this mingled and divided state of mind."
\par 
\par Who could fail to see in this description that lyric poetry is here
\par characterised as an imperfectly attained art, which seldom and only
\par as it were in leaps arrives at its goal, indeed, as a semi-art, the
\par essence of which is said to consist in this, that desire and pure
\par contemplation, _i.e.,_ the un\'e6sthetic and the \'e6sthetic condition, are
\par wonderfully mingled with each other? We maintain rather, that this
\par entire antithesis, according to which, as according to some standard
\par of value, Schopenhauer, too, still classifies the arts, the antithesis
\par between the subjective and the objective, is quite out of place in
\par \'e6sthetics, inasmuch as the subject _i.e.,_ the desiring individual who
\par furthers his own egoistic ends, can be conceived only as the adversary,
\par not as the origin of art. In so far as the subject is the artist,
\par however, he has already been released from his individual will, and has
\par become as it were the medium, through which the one verily existent
\par Subject celebrates his redemption in appearance. For this one thing
\par must above all be clear to us, to our humiliation _and_ exaltation,
\par that the entire comedy of art is not at all performed, say, for our
\par betterment and culture, and that we are just as little the true authors
\par of this art-world: rather we may assume with regard to ourselves, that
\par its true author uses us as pictures and artistic projections, and that
\par we have our highest dignity in our significance as works of art--for
\par only as an _\'e6sthetic phenomenon_ is existence and the world eternally
\par _justified:_--while of course our consciousness of this our specific
\par significance hardly differs from the kind of consciousness which the
\par soldiers painted on canvas have of the battle represented thereon.
\par Hence all our knowledge of art is at bottom quite illusory, because, as
\par knowing persons we are not one and identical with the Being who, as the
\par sole author and spectator of this comedy of art, prepares a perpetual
\par entertainment for himself. Only in so far as the genius in the act of
\par artistic production coalesces with this primordial artist of the world,
\par does he get a glimpse of the eternal essence of art, for in this state
\par he is, in a marvellous manner, like the weird picture of the fairy-tale
\par which can at will turn its eyes and behold itself; he is now at once
\par subject and object, at once poet, actor, and spectator.

\par 
\par 
\par With reference to Archilochus, it has been established by critical
\par research that he introduced the _folk-song_ into literature, and,
\par on account thereof, deserved, according to the general estimate of
\par the Greeks, his unique position alongside of Homer. But what is this
\par popular folk-song in contrast to the wholly Apollonian epos? What
\par else but the _perpetuum vestigium_ of a union of the Apollonian and
\par the Dionysian? Its enormous diffusion among all peoples, still further
\par enhanced by ever new births, testifies to the power of this artistic
\par double impulse of nature: which leaves its vestiges in the popular
\par song in like manner as the orgiastic movements of a people perpetuate
\par themselves in its music. Indeed, one might also furnish historical
\par proofs, that every period which is highly productive in popular songs
\par has been most violently stirred by Dionysian currents, which we must
\par always regard as the substratum and prerequisite of the popular song.
\par 
\par First of all, however, we regard the popular song as the musical mirror
\par of the world, as the Original melody, which now seeks for itself a
\par parallel dream-phenomenon and expresses it in poetry. _Melody is
\par therefore primary and universal,_ and as such may admit of several
\par objectivations, in several texts. Likewise, in the na\'efve estimation of
\par the people, it is regarded as by far the more important and necessary.
\par Melody generates the poem out of itself by an ever-recurring process.
\par _The strophic form of the popular song_ points to the same phenomenon,
\par which I always beheld with astonishment, till at last I found this
\par explanation. Any one who in accordance with this theory examines a
\par collection of popular songs, such as "Des Knaben Wunderhorn," will find
\par innumerable instances of the perpetually productive melody scattering
\par picture sparks all around: which in their variegation, their abrupt
\par change, their mad precipitance, manifest a power quite unknown to the
\par epic appearance and its steady flow. From the point of view of the
\par epos, this unequal and irregular pictorial world of lyric poetry must
\par be simply condemned: and the solemn epic rhapsodists of the Apollonian
\par festivals in the age of Terpander have certainly done so.
\par 
\par Accordingly, we observe that in the poetising of the popular song,
\par language is strained to its utmost _to imitate music;_ and hence a
\par new world of poetry begins with Archilochus, which is fundamentally
\par opposed to the Homeric. And in saying this we have pointed out the
\par only possible relation between poetry and music, between word and
\par tone: the word, the picture, the concept here seeks an expression
\par analogous to music and now experiences in itself the power of music.
\par In this sense we may discriminate between two main currents in the
\par history of the language of the Greek people, according as their
\par language imitated either the world of phenomena and of pictures, or the
\par world of music. One has only to reflect seriously on the linguistic
\par difference with regard to colour, syntactical structure, and vocabulary
\par in Homer and Pindar, in order to comprehend the significance of this
\par contrast; indeed, it becomes palpably clear to us that in the period
\par between Homer and Pindar the _orgiastic flute tones of Olympus_ must
\par have sounded forth, which, in an age as late as Aristotle's, when
\par music was infinitely more developed, transported people to drunken
\par enthusiasm, and which, when their influence was first felt, undoubtedly
\par incited all the poetic means of expression of contemporaneous man
\par to imitation. I here call attention to a familiar phenomenon of our
\par own times, against which our \'e6sthetics raises many objections. We
\par again and again have occasion to observe how a symphony of Beethoven
\par compels the individual hearers to use figurative speech, though the
\par appearance presented by a collocation of the different pictorial
\par world generated by a piece of music may be never so fantastically
\par diversified and even contradictory. To practise its small wit on such
\par compositions, and to overlook a phenomenon which is certainly worth
\par explaining, is quite in keeping with this \'e6sthetics. Indeed, even if
\par the tone-poet has spoken in pictures concerning a composition, when for
\par instance he designates a certain symphony as the "pastoral" symphony,
\par or a passage therein as "the scene by the brook," or another as the
\par "merry gathering of rustics," these are likewise only symbolical
\par representations born out of music--and not perhaps the imitated objects
\par of music--representations which can give us no information whatever
\par concerning the _Dionysian_ content of music, and which in fact have
\par no distinctive value of their own alongside of other pictorical
\par expressions. This process of a discharge of music in pictures we have
\par now to transfer to some youthful, linguistically productive people, to
\par get a notion as to how the strophic popular song originates, and how
\par the entire faculty of speech is stimulated by this new principle of
\par imitation of music.
\par 
\par If, therefore, we may regard lyric poetry as the effulguration of
\par music in pictures and concepts, we can now ask: "how does music
\par _appear_ in the mirror of symbolism and conception?" _It appears as
\par will,_ taking the word in the Schopenhauerian sense, _i.e.,_ as the
\par antithesis of the \'e6sthetic, purely contemplative, and passive frame
\par of mind. Here, however, we must discriminate as sharply as possible
\par between the concept of essentiality and the concept of phenominality;
\par for music, according to its essence, cannot be will, because as such it
\par would have to be wholly banished from the domain of art--for the will
\par is the un\'e6sthetic-in-itself;--yet it appears as will. For in order to
\par express the phenomenon of music in pictures, the lyrist requires all
\par the stirrings of passion, from the whispering of infant desire to the
\par roaring of madness. Under the impulse to speak of music in Apollonian
\par symbols, he conceives of all nature, and himself therein, only as the
\par eternally willing, desiring, longing existence. But in so far as he
\par interprets music by means of pictures, he himself rests in the quiet
\par calm of Apollonian contemplation, however much all around him which
\par he beholds through the medium of music is in a state of confused and
\par violent motion. Indeed, when he beholds himself through this same
\par medium, his own image appears to him in a state of unsatisfied feeling:
\par his own willing, longing, moaning and rejoicing are to him symbols by
\par which he interprets music. Such is the phenomenon of the lyrist: as
\par Apollonian genius he interprets music through the image of the will,
\par while he himself, completely released from the avidity of the will, is
\par the pure, undimmed eye of day.
\par 
\par Our whole disquisition insists on this, that lyric poetry is dependent
\par on the spirit of music just as music itself in its absolute sovereignty
\par does not _require_ the picture and the concept, but only _endures_
\par them as accompaniments. The poems of the lyrist can express nothing
\par which has not already been contained in the vast universality and
\par absoluteness of the music which compelled him to use figurative
\par speech. By no means is it possible for language adequately to render
\par the cosmic symbolism of music, for the very reason that music stands
\par in symbolic relation to the primordial contradiction and primordial
\par pain in the heart of the Primordial Unity, and therefore symbolises a
\par sphere which is above all appearance and before all phenomena. Rather
\par should we say that all phenomena, compared with it, are but symbols:
\par hence _language,_ as the organ and symbol of phenomena, cannot at all
\par disclose the innermost essence, of music; language can only be in
\par superficial contact with music when it attempts to imitate music; while
\par the profoundest significance of the latter cannot be brought one step
\par nearer to us by all the eloquence of lyric poetry.

\par 
\par 
\par We shall now have to avail ourselves of all the principles of art
\par hitherto considered, in order to find our way through the labyrinth,
\par as we must designate _the origin of Greek tragedy._ I shall not be
\par charged with absurdity in saying that the problem of this origin has
\par as yet not even been seriously stated, not to say solved, however
\par often the fluttering tatters of ancient tradition have been sewed
\par together in sundry combinations and torn asunder again. This tradition
\par tells us in the most unequivocal terms, _that tragedy sprang from the
\par tragic chorus,_ and was originally only chorus and nothing but chorus:
\par and hence we feel it our duty to look into the heart of this tragic
\par chorus as being the real proto-drama, without in the least contenting
\par ourselves with current art-phraseology--according to which the chorus
\par is the ideal spectator, or represents the people in contrast to the
\par regal side of the scene. The latter explanatory notion, which sounds
\par sublime to many a politician--that the immutable moral law was embodied
\par by the democratic Athenians in the popular chorus, which always carries
\par its point over the passionate excesses and extravagances of kings--may
\par be ever so forcibly suggested by an observation of Aristotle: still
\par it has no bearing on the original formation of tragedy, inasmuch
\par as the entire antithesis of king and people, and, in general, the
\par whole politico-social sphere, is excluded from the purely religious
\par beginnings of tragedy; but, considering the well-known classical
\par form of the chorus in \'c6schylus and Sophocles, we should even deem
\par it blasphemy to speak here of the anticipation of a "constitutional
\par representation of the people," from which blasphemy others have not
\par shrunk, however. The ancient governments knew of no constitutional
\par representation of the people _in praxi,_ and it is to be hoped that
\par they did not even so much as "anticipate" it in tragedy.
\par 
\par Much more celebrated than this political explanation of the chorus is
\par the notion of A. W. Schlegel, who advises us to regard the chorus, in
\par a manner, as the essence and extract of the crowd of spectators,--as
\par the "ideal spectator." This view when compared with the historical
\par tradition that tragedy was originally only chorus, reveals itself
\par in its true character, as a crude, unscientific, yet brilliant
\par assertion, which, however, has acquired its brilliancy only through
\par its concentrated form of expression, through the truly Germanic bias
\par in favour of whatever is called "ideal," and through our momentary
\par astonishment. For we are indeed astonished the moment we compare our
\par well-known theatrical public with this chorus, and ask ourselves if it
\par could ever be possible to idealise something analogous to the Greek
\par chorus out of such a public. We tacitly deny this, and now wonder
\par as much at the boldness of Schlegel's assertion as at the totally
\par different nature of the Greek public. For hitherto we always believed
\par that the true spectator, be he who he may, had always to remain
\par conscious of having before him a work of art, and not an empiric
\par reality: whereas the tragic chorus of the Greeks is compelled to
\par recognise real beings in the figures of the stage. The chorus of the
\par Oceanides really believes that it sees before it the Titan Prometheus,
\par and considers itself as real as the god of the scene. And are we to
\par own that he is the highest and purest type of spectator, who, like the
\par Oceanides, regards Prometheus as real and present in body? And is it
\par characteristic of the ideal spectator that he should run on the stage
\par and free the god from his torments? We had believed in an \'e6sthetic
\par public, and considered the individual spectator the better qualified
\par the more he was capable of viewing a work of art as art, that is,
\par \'e6sthetically; but now the Schlegelian expression has intimated to us,
\par that the perfect ideal spectator does not at all suffer the world of
\par the scenes to act \'e6sthetically on him, but corporeo-empirically. Oh,
\par these Greeks! we have sighed; they will upset our \'e6sthetics! But once
\par accustomed to it, we have reiterated the saying of Schlegel, as often
\par as the subject of the chorus has been broached.
\par 
\par But the tradition which is so explicit here speaks against Schlegel:
\par the chorus as such, without the stage,--the primitive form of
\par tragedy,--and the chorus of ideal spectators do not harmonise. What
\par kind of art would that be which was extracted from the concept of the
\par spectator, and whereof we are to regard the "spectator as such" as the
\par true form? The spectator without the play is something absurd. We fear
\par that the birth of tragedy can be explained neither by the high esteem
\par for the moral intelligence of the multitude nor by the concept of the
\par spectator without the play; and we regard the problem as too deep to be
\par even so much as touched by such superficial modes of contemplation.
\par 
\par An infinitely more valuable insight into the signification of the
\par chorus had already been displayed by Schiller in the celebrated Preface
\par to his Bride of Messina, where he regarded the chorus as a living wall
\par which tragedy draws round herself to guard her from contact with the
\par world of reality, and to preserve her ideal domain and poetical freedom.
\par 
\par It is with this, his chief weapon, that Schiller combats the ordinary
\par conception of the natural, the illusion ordinarily required in
\par dramatic poetry. He contends that while indeed the day on the stage is
\par merely artificial, the architecture only symbolical, and the metrical
\par dialogue purely ideal in character, nevertheless an erroneous view
\par still prevails in the main: that it is not enough to tolerate merely
\par as a poetical license _that_ which is in reality the essence of all
\par poetry. The introduction of the chorus is, he says, the decisive step
\par by which war is declared openly and honestly against all naturalism
\par in art.--It is, methinks, for disparaging this mode of contemplation
\par that our would-be superior age has coined the disdainful catchword
\par "pseudo-idealism." I fear, however, that we on the other hand with our
\par present worship of the natural and the real have landed at the nadir
\par of all idealism, namely in the region of cabinets of wax-figures. An
\par art indeed exists also here, as in certain novels much in vogue at
\par present: but let no one pester us with the claim that by this art the
\par Schiller-Goethian "Pseudo-idealism" has been vanquished.
\par 
\par It is indeed an "ideal" domain, as Schiller rightly perceived,
\par upon--which the Greek satyric chorus, the chorus of primitive tragedy,
\par was wont to walk, a domain raised far above the actual path of
\par mortals. The Greek framed for this chorus the suspended scaffolding of
\par a fictitious _natural state_ and placed thereon fictitious _natural
\par beings._ It is on this foundation that tragedy grew up, and so it
\par could of course dispense from the very first with a painful portrayal
\par of reality. Yet it is, not an arbitrary world placed by fancy betwixt
\par heaven and earth; rather is it a world possessing the same reality
\par and trustworthiness that Olympus with its dwellers possessed for the
\par believing Hellene. The satyr, as being the Dionysian chorist, lives
\par in a religiously acknowledged reality under the sanction of the myth
\par and cult. That tragedy begins with him, that the Dionysian wisdom of
\par tragedy speaks through him, is just as surprising a phenomenon to us
\par as, in general, the derivation of tragedy from the chorus. Perhaps
\par we shall get a starting-point for our inquiry, if I put forward the
\par proposition that the satyr, the fictitious natural being, is to the
\par man of culture what Dionysian music is to civilisation. Concerning
\par this latter, Richard Wagner says that it is neutralised by music even
\par as lamplight by daylight. In like manner, I believe, the Greek man of
\par culture felt himself neutralised in the presence of the satyric chorus:
\par and this is the most immediate effect of the Dionysian tragedy, that
\par the state and society, and, in general, the gaps between man and man
\par give way to an overwhelming feeling of oneness, which leads back to
\par the heart of nature. The metaphysical comfort,--with which, as I have
\par here intimated, every true tragedy dismisses us--that, in spite of
\par the perpetual change of phenomena, life at bottom is indestructibly
\par powerful and pleasurable, this comfort appears with corporeal lucidity
\par as the satyric chorus, as the chorus of natural beings, who live
\par ineradicable as it were behind all civilisation, and who, in spite of
\par the ceaseless change of generations and the history of nations, remain
\par for ever the same.
\par 
\par With this chorus the deep-minded Hellene, who is so singularly
\par qualified for the most delicate and severe suffering, consoles
\par himself:--he who has glanced with piercing eye into the very heart of
\par the terrible destructive processes of so-called universal history, as
\par also into the cruelty of nature, and is in danger of longing for a
\par Buddhistic negation of the will. Art saves him, and through art life
\par saves him--for herself.
\par 
\par For we must know that in the rapture of the Dionysian state, with its
\par annihilation of the ordinary bounds and limits of existence, there is
\par a _lethargic_ element, wherein all personal experiences of the past
\par are submerged. It is by this gulf of oblivion that the everyday world
\par and the world of Dionysian reality are separated from each other. But
\par as soon as this everyday reality rises again in consciousness, it is
\par felt as such, and nauseates us; an ascetic will-paralysing mood is
\par the fruit of these states. In this sense the Dionysian man may be
\par said to resemble Hamlet: both have for once seen into the true nature
\par of things,--they have _perceived,_ but they are loath to act; for
\par their action cannot change the eternal nature of things; they regard
\par it as shameful or ridiculous that one should require of them to set
\par aright the time which is out of joint. Knowledge kills action, action
\par requires the veil of illusion--it is this lesson which Hamlet teaches,
\par and not the cheap wisdom of John-a-Dreams who from too much reflection,
\par as it were from a surplus of possibilities, does not arrive at action
\par at all. Not reflection, no!--true knowledge, insight into appalling
\par truth, preponderates over all motives inciting to action, in Hamlet as
\par well as in the Dionysian man. No comfort avails any longer; his longing
\par goes beyond a world after death, beyond the gods themselves; existence
\par with its glittering reflection in the gods, or in an immortal other
\par world is abjured. In the consciousness of the truth he has perceived,
\par man now sees everywhere only the awfulness or the absurdity of
\par existence, he now understands the symbolism in the fate of Ophelia, he
\par now discerns the wisdom of the sylvan god Silenus: and loathing seizes
\par him.
\par 
\par Here, in this extremest danger of the will, _art_ approaches, as a
\par saving and healing enchantress; she alone is able to transform these
\par nauseating reflections on the awfulness or absurdity of existence
\par into representations wherewith it is possible to live: these are the
\par representations of the _sublime_ as the artistic subjugation of the
\par awful, and the _comic_ as the artistic delivery from the nausea of
\par the absurd. The satyric chorus of dithyramb is the saving deed of
\par Greek art; the paroxysms described above spent their force in the
\par intermediary world of these Dionysian followers.

\par 
\par 
\par The satyr, like the idyllic shepherd of our more recent time, is the
\par offspring of a longing after the Primitive and the Natural; but mark
\par with what firmness and fearlessness the Greek embraced the man of
\par the woods, and again, how coyly and mawkishly the modern man dallied
\par with the flattering picture of a tender, flute-playing, soft-natured
\par shepherd! Nature, on which as yet no knowledge has been at work,
\par which maintains unbroken barriers to culture--this is what the Greek
\par saw in his satyr, which still was not on this account supposed to
\par coincide with the ape. On the contrary: it was the archetype of
\par man, the embodiment of his highest and strongest emotions, as the
\par enthusiastic reveller enraptured By the proximity of his god, as the
\par fellow-suffering companion in whom the suffering of the god repeats
\par itself, as the herald of wisdom speaking from the very depths of
\par nature, as the emblem of the sexual omnipotence of nature, which the
\par Greek was wont to contemplate with reverential awe. The satyr was
\par something sublime and godlike: he could not but appear so, especially
\par to the sad and wearied eye of the Dionysian man. He would have been
\par offended by our spurious tricked-up shepherd, while his eye dwelt
\par with sublime satisfaction on the naked and unstuntedly magnificent
\par characters of nature: here the illusion of culture was brushed away
\par from the archetype of man; here the true man, the bearded satyr,
\par revealed himself, who shouts joyfully to his god. Before him the
\par cultured man shrank to a lying caricature. Schiller is right also
\par with reference to these beginnings of tragic art: the chorus is a
\par living bulwark against the onsets of reality, because it--the satyric
\par chorus--portrays existence more truthfully, more realistically, more
\par perfectly than the cultured man who ordinarily considers himself as the
\par only reality. The sphere of poetry does not lie outside the world, like
\par some fantastic impossibility of a poet's imagination: it seeks to be
\par the very opposite, the unvarnished expression of truth, and must for
\par this very reason cast aside the false finery of that supposed reality
\par of the cultured man. The contrast between this intrinsic truth of
\par nature and the falsehood of culture, which poses as the only reality,
\par is similar to that existing between the eternal kernel of things, the
\par thing in itself, and the collective world of phenomena. And even as
\par tragedy, with its metaphysical comfort, points to the eternal life of
\par this kernel of existence, notwithstanding the perpetual dissolution of
\par phenomena, so the symbolism of the satyric chorus already expresses
\par figuratively this primordial relation between the thing in itself and
\par phenomenon. The idyllic shepherd of the modern man is but a copy of the
\par sum of the illusions of culture which he calls nature; the Dionysian
\par Greek desires truth and nature in their most potent form;--he sees
\par himself metamorphosed into the satyr.
\par 
\par The revelling crowd of the votaries of Dionysus rejoices, swayed by
\par such moods and perceptions, the power of which transforms them before
\par their own eyes, so that they imagine they behold themselves as
\par reconstituted genii of nature, as satyrs. The later constitution of the
\par tragic chorus is the artistic imitation of this natural phenomenon,
\par which of course required a separation of the Dionysian spectators from
\par the enchanted Dionysians. However, we must never lose sight of the fact
\par that the public of the Attic tragedy rediscovered itself in the chorus
\par of the orchestra, that there was in reality no antithesis of public
\par and chorus: for all was but one great sublime chorus of dancing and
\par singing satyrs, or of such as allowed themselves to be represented by
\par the satyrs. The Schlegelian observation must here reveal itself to us
\par in a deeper sense. The chorus is the "ideal spectator"[5] in so far as
\par it is the only _beholder,_[6] the beholder of the visionary world of
\par the scene. A public of spectators, as known to us, was unknown to the
\par Greeks. In their theatres the terraced structure of the spectators'
\par space rising in concentric arcs enabled every one, in the strictest
\par sense, to _overlook_ the entire world of culture around him, and in
\par surfeited contemplation to imagine himself a chorist. According to
\par this view, then, we may call the chorus in its primitive stage in
\par proto-tragedy, a self-mirroring of the Dionysian man: a phenomenon
\par which may be best exemplified by the process of the actor, who, if he
\par be truly gifted, sees hovering before his eyes with almost tangible
\par perceptibility the character he is to represent. The satyric chorus
\par is first of all a vision of the Dionysian throng, just as the world
\par of the stage is, in turn, a vision of the satyric chorus: the power
\par of this vision is great enough to render the eye dull and insensible
\par to the impression of "reality," to the presence of the cultured men
\par occupying the tiers of seats on every side. The form of the Greek
\par theatre reminds one of a lonesome mountain-valley: the architecture of
\par the scene appears like a luminous cloud-picture which the Bacchants
\par swarming on the mountains behold from the heights, as the splendid
\par encirclement in the midst of which the image of Dionysus is revealed to
\par them.
\par 
\par Owing to our learned conception of the elementary artistic processes,
\par this artistic proto-phenomenon, which is here introduced to explain
\par the tragic chorus, is almost shocking: while nothing can be more
\par certain than that the poet is a poet only in that he beholds himself
\par surrounded by forms which live and act before him, into the innermost
\par being of which his glance penetrates. By reason of a strange defeat in
\par our capacities, we modern men are apt to represent to ourselves the
\par \'e6sthetic proto-phenomenon as too complex and abstract. For the true
\par poet the metaphor is not a rhetorical figure, but a vicarious image
\par which actually hovers before him in place of a concept. The character
\par is not for him an aggregate composed of a studied collection of
\par particular traits, but an irrepressibly live person appearing before
\par his eyes, and differing only from the corresponding vision of the
\par painter by its ever continued life and action. Why is it that Homer
\par sketches much more vividly[7] than all the other poets? Because he
\par contemplates[8] much more. We talk so abstractly about poetry, because
\par we are all wont to be bad poets. At bottom the \'e6sthetic phenomenon is
\par simple: let a man but have the faculty of perpetually seeing a lively
\par play and of constantly living surrounded by hosts of spirits, then he
\par is a poet: let him but feel the impulse to transform himself and to
\par talk from out the bodies and souls of others, then he is a dramatist.
\par 
\par The Dionysian excitement is able to impart to a whole mass of men
\par this artistic faculty of seeing themselves surrounded by such a host
\par of spirits, with whom they know themselves to be inwardly one. This
\par function of the tragic chorus is the _dramatic_ proto-phenomenon: to
\par see one's self transformed before one's self, and then to act as if
\par one had really entered into another body, into another character. This
\par function stands at the beginning of the development of the drama.
\par Here we have something different from the rhapsodist, who does not
\par blend with his pictures, but only sees them, like the painter, with
\par contemplative eye outside of him; here we actually have a surrender
\par of the individual by his entering into another nature. Moreover this
\par phenomenon appears in the form of an epidemic: a whole throng feels
\par itself metamorphosed in this wise. Hence it is that the dithyramb is
\par essentially different from every other variety of the choric song. The
\par virgins, who with laurel twigs in their hands solemnly proceed to
\par the temple of Apollo and sing a processional hymn, remain what they
\par are and retain their civic names: the dithyrambic chorus is a chorus
\par of transformed beings, whose civic past and social rank are totally
\par forgotten: they have become the timeless servants of their god that
\par live aloof from all the spheres of society. Every other variety of
\par the choric lyric of the Hellenes is but an enormous enhancement of
\par the Apollonian unit-singer: while in the dithyramb we have before us
\par a community of unconscious actors, who mutually regard themselves as
\par transformed among one another.
\par 
\par This enchantment is the prerequisite of all dramatic art. In this
\par enchantment the Dionysian reveller sees himself as a satyr, _and as
\par satyr he in turn beholds the god,_ that is, in his transformation he
\par sees a new vision outside him as the Apollonian consummation of his
\par state. With this new vision the drama is complete.
\par 
\par According to this view, we must understand Greek tragedy as the
\par Dionysian chorus, which always disburdens itself anew in an Apollonian
\par world of pictures. The choric parts, therefore, with which tragedy is
\par interlaced, are in a manner the mother-womb of the entire so-called
\par dialogue, that is, of the whole stage-world, of the drama proper. In
\par several successive outbursts does this primordial basis of tragedy beam
\par forth the vision of the drama, which is a dream-phenomenon throughout,
\par and, as such, epic in character: on the other hand, however, as
\par objectivation of a Dionysian state, it does not represent the
\par Apollonian redemption in appearance, but, conversely, the dissolution
\par of the individual and his unification with primordial existence.
\par Accordingly, the drama is the Apollonian embodiment of Dionysian
\par perceptions and influences, and is thereby separated from the epic as
\par by an immense gap.
\par 
\par The _chorus_ of Greek tragedy, the symbol of the mass of the people
\par moved by Dionysian excitement, is thus fully explained by our
\par conception of it as here set forth. Whereas, being accustomed to the
\par position of a chorus on the modern stage, especially an operatic
\par chorus, we could never comprehend why the tragic chorus of the Greeks
\par should be older, more primitive, indeed, more important than the
\par "action" proper,--as has been so plainly declared by the voice of
\par tradition; whereas, furthermore, we could not reconcile with this
\par traditional paramount importance and primitiveness the fact of the
\par chorus' being composed only of humble, ministering beings; indeed, at
\par first only of goatlike satyrs; whereas, finally, the orchestra before
\par the scene was always a riddle to us; we have learned to comprehend at
\par length that the scene, together with the action, was fundamentally
\par and originally conceived only as a _vision,_ that the only reality
\par is just the chorus, which of itself generates the vision and speaks
\par thereof with the entire symbolism of dancing, tone, and word. This
\par chorus beholds in the vision its lord and master Dionysus, and is thus
\par for ever the _serving_ chorus: it sees how he, the god, suffers and
\par glorifies himself, and therefore does not itself _act_. But though its
\par attitude towards the god is throughout the attitude of ministration,
\par this is nevertheless the highest expression, the Dionysian expression
\par of _Nature,_ and therefore, like Nature herself, the chorus utters
\par oracles and wise sayings when transported with enthusiasm: as
\par _fellow-sufferer_ it is also the _sage_ proclaiming truth from out the
\par heart of Nature. Thus, then, originates the fantastic figure, which
\par seems so shocking, of the wise and enthusiastic satyr, who is at the
\par same time "the dumb man" in contrast to the god: the image of Nature
\par and her strongest impulses, yea, the symbol of Nature, and at the same
\par time the herald of her art and wisdom: musician, poet, dancer, and
\par visionary in one person.
\par 
\par Agreeably to this view, and agreeably to tradition, _Dionysus,_ the
\par proper stage-hero and focus of vision, is not at first actually present
\par in the oldest period of tragedy, but is only imagined as present:
\par _i.e.,_ tragedy is originally only "chorus" and not "drama." Later
\par on the attempt is made to exhibit the god as real and to display the
\par visionary figure together with its glorifying encirclement before the
\par eyes of all; it is here that the "drama" in the narrow sense of the
\par term begins. To the dithyrambic chorus is now assigned the task of
\par exciting the minds of the hearers to such a pitch of Dionysian frenzy,
\par that, when the tragic hero appears on the stage, they do not behold
\par in him, say, the unshapely masked man, but a visionary figure, born
\par as it were of their own ecstasy. Let us picture Admetes thinking in
\par profound meditation of his lately departed wife Alcestis, and quite
\par consuming himself in spiritual contemplation thereof--when suddenly
\par the veiled figure of a woman resembling her in form and gait is led
\par towards him: let us picture his sudden trembling anxiety, his agitated
\par comparisons, his instinctive conviction--and we shall have an analogon
\par to the sensation with which the spectator, excited to Dionysian frenzy,
\par saw the god approaching on the stage, a god with whose sufferings he
\par had already become identified. He involuntarily transferred the entire
\par picture of the god, fluttering magically before his soul, to this
\par masked figure and resolved its reality as it were into a phantasmal
\par unreality. This is the Apollonian dream-state, in which the world
\par of day is veiled, and a new world, clearer, more intelligible, more
\par striking than the former, and nevertheless more shadowy, is ever born
\par anew in perpetual change before our eyes. We accordingly recognise in
\par tragedy a thorough-going stylistic contrast: the language, colour,
\par flexibility and dynamics of the dialogue fall apart in the Dionysian
\par lyrics of the chorus on the one hand, and in the Apollonian dream-world
\par of the scene on the other, into entirely separate spheres of
\par expression. The Apollonian appearances, in which Dionysus objectifies
\par himself, are no longer "ein ewiges Meer, ein wechselnd Weben, ein
\par gl\'fchend Leben,"[9] as is the music of the chorus, they are no longer
\par the forces merely felt, but not condensed into a picture, by which
\par the inspired votary of Dionysus divines the proximity of his god: the
\par clearness and firmness of epic form now speak to him from the scene,
\par Dionysus now no longer speaks through forces, but as an epic hero,
\par almost in the language of Homer.

\par Whatever rises to the surface in the dialogue of the Apollonian part
\par of Greek tragedy, appears simple, transparent, beautiful. In this
\par sense the dialogue is a copy of the Hellene, whose nature reveals
\par itself in the dance, because in the dance the greatest energy is merely
\par potential, but betrays itself nevertheless in flexible and vivacious
\par movements. The language of the Sophoclean heroes, for instance,
\par surprises us by its Apollonian precision and clearness, so that we at
\par once imagine we see into the innermost recesses of their being, and
\par marvel not a little that the way to these recesses is so short. But
\par if for the moment we disregard the character of the hero which rises
\par to the surface and grows visible--and which at bottom is nothing but
\par the light-picture cast on a dark wall, that is, appearance through and
\par through,--if rather we enter into the myth which projects itself in
\par these bright mirrorings, we shall of a sudden experience a phenomenon
\par which bears a reverse relation to one familiar in optics. When, after
\par a vigorous effort to gaze into the sun, we turn away blinded, we have
\par dark-coloured spots before our eyes as restoratives, so to speak;
\par while, on the contrary, those light-picture phenomena of the Sophoclean
\par hero,--in short, the Apollonian of the mask,--are the necessary
\par productions of a glance into the secret and terrible things of nature,
\par as it were shining spots to heal the eye which dire night has seared.
\par Only in this sense can we hope to be able to grasp the true meaning of
\par the serious and significant notion of "Greek cheerfulness"; while of
\par course we encounter the misunderstood notion of this cheerfulness, as
\par resulting from a state of unendangered comfort, on all the ways and
\par paths of the present time.
\par 
\par The most sorrowful figure of the Greek stage, the hapless _\'8cdipus,_
\par was understood by Sophocles as the noble man, who in spite of his
\par wisdom was destined to error and misery, but nevertheless through
\par his extraordinary sufferings ultimately exerted a magical, wholesome
\par influence on all around him, which continues effective even after
\par his death. The noble man does not sin; this is what the thoughtful
\par poet wishes to tell us: all laws, all natural order, yea, the moral
\par world itself, may be destroyed through his action, but through this
\par very action a higher magic circle of influences is brought into play,
\par which establish a new world on the ruins of the old that has been
\par overthrown. This is what the poet, in so far as he is at the same time
\par a religious thinker, wishes to tell us: as poet, he shows us first of
\par all a wonderfully complicated legal mystery, which the judge slowly
\par unravels, link by link, to his own destruction. The truly Hellenic
\par delight at this dialectical loosening is so great, that a touch of
\par surpassing cheerfulness is thereby communicated to the entire play,
\par which everywhere blunts the edge of the horrible presuppositions of the
\par procedure. In the "\'8cdipus at Colonus" we find the same cheerfulness,
\par elevated, however, to an infinite transfiguration: in contrast to
\par the aged king, subjected to an excess of misery, and exposed solely
\par as a _sufferer_ to all that befalls him, we have here a supermundane
\par cheerfulness, which descends from a divine sphere and intimates to
\par us that in his purely passive attitude the hero attains his highest
\par activity, the influence of which extends far beyond his life, while
\par his earlier conscious musing and striving led him only to passivity.
\par Thus, then, the legal knot of the fable of \'8cdipus, which to mortal
\par eyes appears indissolubly entangled, is slowly unravelled--and the
\par profoundest human joy comes upon us in the presence of this divine
\par counterpart of dialectics. If this explanation does justice to the
\par poet, it may still be asked whether the substance of the myth is
\par thereby exhausted; and here it turns out that the entire conception
\par of the poet is nothing but the light-picture which healing nature
\par holds up to us after a glance into the abyss. \'8cdipus, the murderer of
\par his father, the husband of his mother, \'8cdipus, the interpreter of the
\par riddle of the Sphinx! What does the mysterious triad of these deeds
\par of destiny tell us? There is a primitive popular belief, especially
\par in Persia, that a wise Magian can be born only of incest: which
\par we have forthwith to interpret to ourselves with reference to the
\par riddle-solving and mother-marrying \'8cdipus, to the effect that when
\par the boundary of the present and future, the rigid law of individuation
\par and, in general, the intrinsic spell of nature, are broken by prophetic
\par and magical powers, an extraordinary counter-naturalness--as, in this
\par case, incest--must have preceded as a cause; for how else could one
\par force nature to surrender her secrets but by victoriously opposing her,
\par _i.e.,_ by means of the Unnatural? It is this intuition which I see
\par imprinted in the awful triad of the destiny of \'8cdipus: the very man
\par who solves the riddle of nature--that double-constituted Sphinx--must
\par also, as the murderer of his father and husband of his mother, break
\par the holiest laws of nature. Indeed, it seems as if the myth sought to
\par whisper into our ears that wisdom, especially Dionysian wisdom, is
\par an unnatural abomination, and that whoever, through his knowledge,
\par plunges nature into an abyss of annihilation, must also experience
\par the dissolution of nature in himself. "The sharpness of wisdom turns
\par round upon the sage: wisdom is a crime against nature": such terrible
\par expressions does the myth call out to us: but the Hellenic poet touches
\par like a sunbeam the sublime and formidable Memnonian statue of the myth,
\par so that it suddenly begins to sound--in Sophoclean melodies.
\par 
\par With the glory of passivity I now contrast the glory of activity which
\par illuminates the _Prometheus_ of \'c6schylus. That which \'c6schylus the
\par thinker had to tell us here, but which as a poet he only allows us to
\par surmise by his symbolic picture, the youthful Goethe succeeded in
\par disclosing to us in the daring words of his Prometheus:--
\par 
\par     "Hier sitz' ich, forme Menschen
\par     Nach meinem Bilde,
\par     Ein Geschlecht, das mir gleich sei,
\par     Zu leiden, zu weinen,
\par     Zu geniessen und zu freuen sich,
\par     Und dein nicht zu achten,
\par     Wie ich!"[10]
\par 
\par Man, elevating himself to the rank of the Titans, acquires his culture
\par by his own efforts, and compels the gods to unite with him, because
\par in his self-sufficient wisdom he has their existence and their limits
\par in his hand. What is most wonderful, however, in this Promethean
\par form, which according to its fundamental conception is the specific
\par hymn of impiety, is the profound \'c6schylean yearning for _justice_:
\par the untold sorrow of the bold "single-handed being" on the one hand,
\par and the divine need, ay, the foreboding of a twilight of the gods, on
\par the other, the power of these two worlds of suffering constraining
\par to reconciliation, to metaphysical oneness--all this suggests most
\par forcibly the central and main position of the \'c6schylean view of
\par things, which sees Moira as eternal justice enthroned above gods and
\par men. In view of the astonishing boldness with which \'c6schylus places the
\par Olympian world on his scales of justice, it must be remembered that
\par the deep-minded Greek had an immovably firm substratum of metaphysical
\par thought in his mysteries, and that all his sceptical paroxysms could
\par be discharged upon the Olympians. With reference to these deities,
\par the Greek artist, in particular, had an obscure feeling as to mutual
\par dependency: and it is just in the Prometheus of \'c6schylus that this
\par feeling is symbolised. The Titanic artist found in himself the
\par daring belief that he could create men and at least destroy Olympian
\par deities: namely, by his superior wisdom, for which, to be sure, he had
\par to atone by eternal suffering. The splendid "can-ing" of the great
\par genius, bought too cheaply even at the price of eternal suffering,
\par the stern pride of the _artist_: this is the essence and soul of
\par \'c6schylean poetry, while Sophocles in his \'8cdipus preludingly strikes up
\par the victory-song of the _saint_. But even this interpretation which
\par \'c6schylus has given to the myth does not fathom its astounding depth of
\par terror; the fact is rather that the artist's delight in unfolding, the
\par cheerfulness of artistic creating bidding defiance to all calamity,
\par is but a shining stellar and nebular image reflected in a black sea
\par of sadness. The tale of Prometheus is an original possession of the
\par entire Aryan family of races, and documentary evidence of their
\par capacity for the profoundly tragic; indeed, it is not improbable that
\par this myth has the same characteristic significance for the Aryan
\par race that the myth of the fall of man has for the Semitic, and that
\par there is a relationship between the two myths like that of brother and
\par sister. The presupposition of the Promethean myth is the transcendent
\par value which a na\'efve humanity attach to _fire_ as the true palladium
\par of every ascending culture: that man, however, should dispose at will
\par of this fire, and should not receive it only as a gift from heaven,
\par as the igniting lightning or the warming solar flame, appeared to the
\par contemplative primordial men as crime and robbery of the divine nature.
\par And thus the first philosophical problem at once causes a painful,
\par irreconcilable antagonism between man and God, and puts as it were
\par a mass of rock at the gate of every culture. The best and highest
\par that men can acquire they obtain by a crime, and must now in their
\par turn take upon themselves its consequences, namely the whole flood of
\par sufferings and sorrows with which the offended celestials _must_ visit
\par the nobly aspiring race of man: a bitter reflection, which, by the
\par _dignity_ it confers on crime, contrasts strangely with the Semitic
\par myth of the fall of man, in which curiosity, beguilement, seducibility,
\par wantonness,--in short, a whole series of pre-eminently feminine
\par passions,--were regarded as the origin of evil. What distinguishes
\par the Aryan representation is the sublime view of _active sin_ as the
\par properly Promethean virtue, which suggests at the same time the ethical
\par basis of pessimistic tragedy as the _justification_ of human evil--of
\par human guilt as well as of the suffering incurred thereby. The misery in
\par the essence of things--which the contemplative Aryan is not disposed
\par to explain away--the antagonism in the heart of the world, manifests
\par itself to him as a medley of different worlds, for instance, a Divine
\par and a human world, each of which is in the right individually, but
\par as a separate existence alongside of another has to suffer for its
\par individuation. With the heroic effort made by the individual for
\par universality, in his attempt to pass beyond the bounds of individuation
\par and become the _one_ universal being, he experiences in himself the
\par primordial contradiction concealed in the essence of things, _i.e.,_
\par he trespasses and suffers. Accordingly crime[11] is understood by
\par the Aryans to be a man, sin[12] by the Semites a woman; as also, the
\par original crime is committed by man, the original sin by woman. Besides,
\par the witches' chorus says:
\par 
\par     "Wir nehmen das nicht so genau:
\par     Mit tausend Schritten macht's die Frau;
\par     Doch wie sie auch sich eilen kann
\par     Mit einem Sprunge macht's der Mann."[13]
\par 
\par He who understands this innermost core of the tale of
\par Prometheus--namely the necessity of crime imposed on the titanically
\par striving individual--will at once be conscious of the un-Apollonian
\par nature of this pessimistic representation: for Apollo seeks to pacify
\par individual beings precisely by drawing boundary lines between them,
\par and by again and again calling attention thereto, with his requirements
\par of self-knowledge and due proportion, as the holiest laws of the
\par universe. In order, however, to prevent the form from congealing to
\par Egyptian rigidity and coldness in consequence of this Apollonian
\par tendency, in order to prevent the extinction of the motion of the
\par entire lake in the effort to prescribe to the individual wave its path
\par and compass, the high tide of the Dionysian tendency destroyed from
\par time to time all the little circles in which the one-sided Apollonian
\par "will" sought to confine the Hellenic world. The suddenly swelling
\par tide of the Dionysian then takes the separate little wave-mountains of
\par individuals on its back, just as the brother of Prometheus, the Titan
\par Atlas, does with the earth. This Titanic impulse, to become as it were
\par the Atlas of all individuals, and to carry them on broad shoulders
\par higher and higher, farther and farther, is what the Promethean and the
\par Dionysian have in common. In this respect the \'c6schylean Prometheus is
\par a Dionysian mask, while, in the afore-mentioned profound yearning for
\par justice, \'c6schylus betrays to the intelligent observer his paternal
\par descent from Apollo, the god of individuation and of the boundaries
\par of justice. And so the double-being of the \'c6schylean Prometheus, his
\par conjoint Dionysian and Apollonian nature, might be thus expressed in
\par an abstract formula: "Whatever exists is alike just and unjust, and
\par equally justified in both."

\par 
\par It is an indisputable tradition that Greek tragedy in its earliest
\par form had for its theme only the sufferings of Dionysus, and that for
\par some time the only stage-hero therein was simply Dionysus himself.
\par With the same confidence, however, we can maintain that not until
\par Euripides did Dionysus cease to be the tragic hero, and that in fact
\par all the celebrated figures of the Greek stage--Prometheus, \'8cdipus,
\par etc.--are but masks of this original hero, Dionysus. The presence of a
\par god behind all these masks is the one essential cause of the typical
\par "ideality," so oft exciting wonder, of these celebrated figures. Some
\par one, I know not whom, has maintained that all individuals are comic as
\par individuals and are consequently un-tragic: from whence it might be
\par inferred that the Greeks in general _could_ not endure individuals on
\par the tragic stage. And they really seem to have had these sentiments:
\par as, in general, it is to be observed that the Platonic discrimination
\par and valuation of the "idea" in contrast to the "eidolon," the image,
\par is deeply rooted in the Hellenic being. Availing ourselves of Plato's
\par terminology, however, we should have to speak of the tragic figures of
\par the Hellenic stage somewhat as follows. The one truly real Dionysus
\par appears in a multiplicity of forms, in the mask of a fighting hero
\par and entangled, as it were, in the net of an individual will. As the
\par visibly appearing god now talks and acts, he resembles an erring,
\par striving, suffering individual: and that, in general, he _appears_
\par with such epic precision and clearness, is due to the dream-reading
\par Apollo, who reads to the chorus its Dionysian state through this
\par symbolic appearance. In reality, however, this hero is the suffering
\par Dionysus of the mysteries, a god experiencing in himself the sufferings
\par of individuation, of whom wonderful myths tell that as a boy he was
\par dismembered by the Titans and has been worshipped in this state
\par as Zagreus:[15] whereby is intimated that this dismemberment, the
\par properly Dionysian _suffering,_ is like a transformation into air,
\par water, earth, and fire, that we must therefore regard the state of
\par individuation as the source and primal cause of all suffering, as
\par something objectionable in itself. From the smile of this Dionysus
\par sprang the Olympian gods, from his tears sprang man. In his existence
\par as a dismembered god, Dionysus has the dual nature of a cruel
\par barbarised demon, and a mild pacific ruler. But the hope of the epopts
\par looked for a new birth of Dionysus, which we have now to conceive of in
\par anticipation as the end of individuation: it was for this coming third
\par Dionysus that the stormy jubilation-hymns of the epopts resounded. And
\par it is only this hope that sheds a ray of joy upon the features of a
\par world torn asunder and shattered into individuals: as is symbolised in
\par the myth by Demeter sunk in eternal sadness, who _rejoices_ again only
\par when told that she may _once more_ give birth to Dionysus In the views
\par of things here given we already have all the elements of a profound and
\par pessimistic contemplation of the world, and along with these we have
\par the _mystery doctrine of tragedy_: the fundamental knowledge of the
\par oneness of all existing things, the consideration of individuation as
\par the primal cause of evil, and art as the joyous hope that the spell of
\par individuation may be broken, as the augury of a restored oneness.
\par 
\par It has already been intimated that the Homeric epos is the poem
\par of Olympian culture, wherewith this culture has sung its own song
\par of triumph over the terrors of the war of the Titans. Under the
\par predominating influence of tragic poetry, these Homeric myths are now
\par reproduced anew, and show by this metempsychosis that meantime the
\par Olympian culture also has been vanquished by a still deeper view of
\par things. The haughty Titan Prometheus has announced to his Olympian
\par tormentor that the extremest danger will one day menace his rule,
\par unless he ally with him betimes. In \'c6schylus we perceive the terrified
\par Zeus, apprehensive of his end, in alliance with the Titan. Thus, the
\par former age of the Titans is subsequently brought from Tartarus once
\par more to the light of day. The philosophy of wild and naked nature
\par beholds with the undissembled mien of truth the myths of the Homeric
\par world as they dance past: they turn pale, they tremble before the
\par lightning glance of this goddess--till the powerful fist[16] of
\par the Dionysian artist forces them into the service of the new deity.
\par Dionysian truth takes over the entire domain of myth as symbolism of
\par _its_ knowledge, which it makes known partly in the public cult of
\par tragedy and partly in the secret celebration of the dramatic mysteries,
\par always, however, in the old mythical garb. What was the power, which
\par freed Prometheus from his vultures and transformed the myth into a
\par vehicle of Dionysian wisdom? It is the Heracleian power of music:
\par which, having reached its highest manifestness in tragedy, can invest
\par myths with a new and most profound significance, which we have already
\par had occasion to characterise as the most powerful faculty of music. For
\par it is the fate of every myth to insinuate itself into the narrow limits
\par of some alleged historical reality, and to be treated by some later
\par generation as a solitary fact with historical claims: and the Greeks
\par were already fairly on the way to restamp the whole of their mythical
\par juvenile dream sagaciously and arbitrarily into a historico-pragmatical
\par _juvenile history._ For this is the manner in which religions are
\par wont to die out: when of course under the stern, intelligent eyes of
\par an orthodox dogmatism, the mythical presuppositions of a religion are
\par systematised as a completed sum of historical events, and when one
\par begins apprehensively to defend the credibility of the myth, while at
\par the same time opposing all continuation of their natural vitality and
\par luxuriance; when, accordingly, the feeling for myth dies out, and its
\par place is taken by the claim of religion to historical foundations.
\par This dying myth was now seized by the new-born genius of Dionysian
\par music, in whose hands it bloomed once more, with such colours as it
\par had never yet displayed, with a fragrance that awakened a longing
\par anticipation of a metaphysical world. After this final effulgence
\par it collapses, its leaves wither, and soon the scoffing Lucians of
\par antiquity catch at the discoloured and faded flowers which the winds
\par carry off in every direction. Through tragedy the myth attains its
\par profoundest significance, its most expressive form; it rises once more
\par like a wounded hero, and the whole surplus of vitality, together with
\par the philosophical calmness of the Dying, burns in its eyes with a last
\par powerful gleam.
\par 
\par What meantest thou, oh impious Euripides, in seeking once more to
\par enthral this dying one? It died under thy ruthless hands: and then
\par thou madest use of counterfeit, masked myth, which like the ape of
\par Heracles could only trick itself out in the old finery. And as myth
\par died in thy hands, so also died the genius of music; though thou
\par couldst covetously plunder all the gardens of music--thou didst only
\par realise a counterfeit, masked music. And because thou hast forsaken
\par Dionysus. Apollo hath also forsaken thee; rout up all the passions from
\par their haunts and conjure them into thy sphere, sharpen and polish a
\par sophistical dialectics for the speeches of thy heroes--thy very heroes
\par have only counterfeit, masked passions, and speak only counterfeit,
\par masked music.

\par 
\par Greek tragedy had a fate different from that of all her older sister
\par arts: she died by suicide, in consequence of an irreconcilable
\par conflict; accordingly she died tragically, while they all passed away
\par very calmly and beautifully in ripe old age. For if it be in accordance
\par with a happy state of things to depart this life without a struggle,
\par leaving behind a fair posterity, the closing period of these older
\par arts exhibits such a happy state of things: slowly they sink out of
\par sight, and before their dying eyes already stand their fairer progeny,
\par who impatiently lift up their heads with courageous mien. The death of
\par Greek tragedy, on the other hand, left an immense void, deeply felt
\par everywhere. Even as certain Greek sailors in the time of Tiberius once
\par heard upon a lonesome island the thrilling cry, "great Pan is dead": so
\par now as it were sorrowful wailing sounded through the Hellenic world:
\par "Tragedy is dead! Poetry itself has perished with her! Begone, begone,
\par ye stunted, emaciated epigones! Begone to Hades, that ye may for once
\par eat your fill of the crumbs of your former masters!"
\par 
\par But when after all a new Art blossomed forth which revered tragedy as
\par her ancestress and mistress, it was observed with horror that she did
\par indeed bear the features of her mother, but those very features the
\par latter had exhibited in her long death-struggle. It was _Euripides_ who
\par fought this death-struggle of tragedy; the later art is known as the
\par _New Attic Comedy._ In it the degenerate form of tragedy lived on as a
\par monument of the most painful and violent death of tragedy proper.
\par 
\par This connection between the two serves to explain the passionate
\par attachment to Euripides evinced by the poets of the New Comedy, and
\par hence we are no longer surprised at the wish of Philemon, who would
\par have got himself hanged at once, with the sole design of being able
\par to visit Euripides in the lower regions: if only he could be assured
\par generally that the deceased still had his wits. But if we desire, as
\par briefly as possible, and without professing to say aught exhaustive on
\par the subject, to characterise what Euripides has in common with Menander
\par and Philemon, and what appealed to them so strongly as worthy of
\par imitation: it will suffice to say that the _spectator_ was brought upon
\par the stage by Euripides. He who has perceived the material of which the
\par Promethean tragic writers prior to Euripides formed their heroes, and
\par how remote from their purpose it was to bring the true mask of reality
\par on the stage, will also know what to make of the wholly divergent
\par tendency of Euripides. Through him the commonplace individual forced
\par his way from the spectators' benches to the stage itself; the mirror in
\par which formerly only great and bold traits found expression now showed
\par the painful exactness that conscientiously reproduces even the abortive
\par lines of nature. Odysseus, the typical Hellene of the Old Art, sank,
\par in the hands of the new poets, to the figure of the Gr\'e6culus, who, as
\par the good-naturedly cunning domestic slave, stands henceforth in the
\par centre of dramatic interest. What Euripides takes credit for in the
\par Aristophanean "Frogs," namely, that by his household remedies he freed
\par tragic art from its pompous corpulency, is apparent above all in his
\par tragic heroes. The spectator now virtually saw and heard his double on
\par the Euripidean stage, and rejoiced that he could talk so well. But this
\par joy was not all: one even learned of Euripides how to speak: he prides
\par himself upon this in his contest with \'c6schylus: how the people have
\par learned from him how to observe, debate, and draw conclusions according
\par to the rules of art and with the cleverest sophistications. In general
\par it may be said that through this revolution of the popular language he
\par made the New Comedy possible. For it was henceforth no longer a secret,
\par how--and with what saws--the commonplace could represent and express
\par itself on the stage. Civic mediocrity, on which Euripides built all
\par his political hopes, was now suffered to speak, while heretofore the
\par demigod in tragedy and the drunken satyr, or demiman, in comedy, had
\par determined the character of the language. And so the Aristophanean
\par Euripides prides himself on having portrayed the common, familiar,
\par everyday life and dealings of the people, concerning which all are
\par qualified to pass judgment. If now the entire populace philosophises,
\par manages land and goods with unheard-of circumspection, and conducts
\par law-suits, he takes all the credit to himself, and glories in the
\par splendid results of the wisdom with which he inoculated the rabble.
\par 
\par It was to a populace prepared and enlightened in this manner that the
\par New Comedy could now address itself, of which Euripides had become
\par as it were the chorus-master; only that in this case the chorus of
\par spectators had to be trained. As soon as this chorus was trained to
\par sing in the Euripidean key, there arose that chesslike variety of the
\par drama, the New Comedy, with its perpetual triumphs of cunning and
\par artfulness. But Euripides--the chorus-master--was praised incessantly:
\par indeed, people would have killed themselves in order to learn yet more
\par from him, had they not known that tragic poets were quite as dead as
\par tragedy. But with it the Hellene had surrendered the belief in his
\par immortality; not only the belief in an ideal past, but also the belief
\par in an ideal future. The saying taken from the well-known epitaph, "as
\par an old man, frivolous and capricious," applies also to aged Hellenism.
\par The passing moment, wit, levity, and caprice, are its highest deities;
\par the fifth class, that of the slaves, now attains to power, at least in
\par sentiment: and if we can still speak at all of "Greek cheerfulness,"
\par it is the cheerfulness of the slave who has nothing of consequence to
\par answer for, nothing great to strive for, and cannot value anything of
\par the past or future higher than the present. It was this semblance of
\par "Greek cheerfulness" which so revolted the deep-minded and formidable
\par natures of the first four centuries of Christianity: this womanish
\par flight from earnestness and terror, this cowardly contentedness with
\par easy pleasure, was not only contemptible to them, but seemed to be a
\par specifically anti-Christian sentiment. And we must ascribe it to its
\par influence that the conception of Greek antiquity, which lived on for
\par centuries, preserved with almost enduring persistency that peculiar
\par hectic colour of cheerfulness--as if there had never been a Sixth
\par Century with its birth of tragedy, its Mysteries, its Pythagoras and
\par Heraclitus, indeed as if the art-works of that great period did not at
\par all exist, which in fact--each by itself--can in no wise be explained
\par as having sprung from the soil of such a decrepit and slavish love
\par of existence and cheerfulness, and point to an altogether different
\par conception of things as their source.
\par 
\par The assertion made a moment ago, that Euripides introduced the
\par spectator on the stage to qualify him the better to pass judgment on
\par the drama, will make it appear as if the old tragic art was always
\par in a false relation to the spectator: and one would be tempted to
\par extol the radical tendency of Euripides to bring about an adequate
\par relation between art-work and public as an advance on Sophocles. But,
\par as things are, "public" is merely a word, and not at all a homogeneous
\par and constant quantity. Why should the artist be under obligations to
\par accommodate himself to a power whose strength is merely in numbers?
\par And if by virtue of his endowments and aspirations he feels himself
\par superior to every one of these spectators, how could he feel greater
\par respect for the collective expression of all these subordinate
\par capacities than for the relatively highest-endowed individual
\par spectator? In truth, if ever a Greek artist treated his public
\par throughout a long life with presumptuousness and self-sufficiency,
\par it was Euripides, who, even when the masses threw themselves at his
\par feet, with sublime defiance made an open assault on his own tendency,
\par the very tendency with which he had triumphed over the masses. If this
\par genius had had the slightest reverence for the pandemonium of the
\par public, he would have broken down long before the middle of his career
\par beneath the weighty blows of his own failures. These considerations
\par here make it obvious that our formula--namely, that Euripides brought
\par the spectator upon the stage, in order to make him truly competent to
\par pass judgment--was but a provisional one, and that we must seek for a
\par deeper understanding of his tendency. Conversely, it is undoubtedly
\par well known that \'c6schylus and Sophocles, during all their lives, indeed,
\par far beyond their lives, enjoyed the full favour of the people, and that
\par therefore in the case of these predecessors of Euripides the idea of
\par a false relation between art-work and public was altogether excluded.
\par What was it that thus forcibly diverted this highly gifted artist, so
\par incessantly impelled to production, from the path over which shone the
\par sun of the greatest names in poetry and the cloudless heaven of popular
\par favour? What strange consideration for the spectator led him to defy,
\par the spectator? How could he, owing to too much respect for the public
\par --dis-respect the public?
\par 
\par Euripides--and this is the solution of the riddle just propounded--felt
\par himself, as a poet, undoubtedly superior to the masses, but not to
\par two of his spectators: he brought the masses upon the stage; these
\par two spectators he revered as the only competent judges and masters
\par of his art: in compliance with their directions and admonitions, he
\par transferred the entire world of sentiments, passions, and experiences,
\par hitherto present at every festival representation as the invisible
\par chorus on the spectators' benches, into the souls of his stage-heroes;
\par he yielded to their demands when he also sought for these new
\par characters the new word and the new tone; in their voices alone he
\par heard the conclusive verdict on his work, as also the cheering promise
\par of triumph when he found himself condemned as usual by the justice of
\par the public.
\par 
\par Of these two, spectators the one is--Euripides himself, Euripides _as
\par thinker,_ not as poet. It might be said of him, that his unusually
\par large fund of critical ability, as in the case of Lessing, if it did
\par not create, at least constantly fructified a productively artistic
\par collateral impulse. With this faculty, with all the clearness and
\par dexterity of his critical thought, Euripides had sat in the theatre and
\par striven to recognise in the masterpieces of his great predecessors, as
\par in faded paintings, feature and feature, line and line. And here had
\par happened to him what one initiated in the deeper arcana of \'c6schylean
\par tragedy must needs have expected: he observed something incommensurable
\par in every feature and in every line, a certain deceptive distinctness
\par and at the same time an enigmatic profundity, yea an infinitude, of
\par background. Even the clearest figure had always a comet's tail attached
\par to it, which seemed to suggest the uncertain and the inexplicable.
\par The same twilight shrouded the structure of the drama, especially the
\par significance of the chorus. And how doubtful seemed the solution of
\par the ethical problems to his mind! How questionable the treatment of
\par the myths! How unequal the distribution of happiness and misfortune!
\par Even in the language of the Old Tragedy there was much that was
\par objectionable to him, or at least enigmatical; he found especially
\par too much pomp for simple affairs, too many tropes and immense things
\par for the plainness of the characters. Thus he sat restlessly pondering
\par in the theatre, and as a spectator he acknowledged to himself that he
\par did not understand his great predecessors. If, however, he thought the
\par understanding the root proper of all enjoyment and productivity, he had
\par to inquire and look about to see whether any one else thought as he
\par did, and also acknowledged this incommensurability. But most people,
\par and among them the best individuals, had only a distrustful smile for
\par him, while none could explain why the great masters were still in the
\par right in face of his scruples and objections. And in this painful
\par condition he found _that other spectator,_ who did not comprehend,
\par and therefore did not esteem, tragedy. In alliance with him he could
\par venture, from amid his lonesomeness, to begin the prodigious struggle
\par against the art of \'c6schylus and Sophocles--not with polemic writings,
\par but as a dramatic poet, who opposed _his own_ conception of tragedy to
\par the traditional one.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 12.
\par 
\par 
\par Before we name this other spectator, let us pause here a moment in
\par order to recall our own impression, as previously described, of the
\par discordant and incommensurable elements in the nature of \'c6schylean
\par tragedy. Let us think of our own astonishment at the _chorus_ and
\par the _tragic hero_ of that type of tragedy, neither of which we could
\par reconcile with our practices any more than with tradition--till we
\par rediscovered this duplexity itself as the origin and essence of Greek
\par tragedy, as the expression of two interwoven artistic impulses, _the
\par Apollonian and the Dionysian_.
\par 
\par To separate this primitive and all-powerful Dionysian element from
\par tragedy, and to build up a new and purified form of tragedy on the
\par basis of a non-Dionysian art, morality, and conception of things--such
\par is the tendency of Euripides which now reveals itself to us in a clear
\par light.
\par 
\par In a myth composed in the eve of his life, Euripides himself most
\par urgently propounded to his contemporaries the question as to the
\par value and signification of this tendency. Is the Dionysian entitled
\par to exist at all? Should it not be forcibly rooted out of the Hellenic
\par soil? Certainly, the poet tells us, if only it were possible: but the
\par god Dionysus is too powerful; his most intelligent adversary--like
\par Pentheus in the "Bacch\'e6"--is unwittingly enchanted by him, and
\par in this enchantment meets his fate. The judgment of the two old
\par sages, Cadmus and Tiresias, seems to be also the judgment of the
\par aged poet: that the reflection of the wisest individuals does not
\par overthrow old popular traditions, nor the perpetually propagating
\par worship of Dionysus, that in fact it behoves us to display at least a
\par diplomatically cautious concern in the presence of such strange forces:
\par where however it is always possible that the god may take offence
\par at such lukewarm participation, and finally change the diplomat--in
\par this case Cadmus--into a dragon. This is what a poet tells us, who
\par opposed Dionysus with heroic valour throughout a long life--in order
\par finally to wind up his career with a glorification of his adversary,
\par and with suicide, like one staggering from giddiness, who, in order
\par to escape the horrible vertigo he can no longer endure, casts himself
\par from a tower. This tragedy--the Bacch\'e6--is a protest against the
\par practicability of his own tendency; alas, and it has already been
\par put into practice! The surprising thing had happened: when the poet
\par recanted, his tendency had already conquered. Dionysus had already
\par been scared from the tragic stage, and in fact by a demonic power
\par which spoke through Euripides. Even Euripides was, in a certain sense,
\par only a mask: the deity that spoke through him was neither Dionysus nor
\par Apollo, but an altogether new-born demon, called _Socrates._ This is
\par the new antithesis: the Dionysian and the Socratic, and the art-work of
\par Greek tragedy was wrecked on it. What if even Euripides now seeks to
\par comfort us by his recantation? It is of no avail: the most magnificent
\par temple lies in ruins. What avails the lamentation of the destroyer,
\par and his confession that it was the most beautiful of all temples? And
\par even that Euripides has been changed into a dragon as a punishment by
\par the art-critics of all ages--who could be content with this wretched
\par compensation?
\par 
\par Let us now approach this _Socratic_ tendency with which Euripides
\par combated and vanquished \'c6schylean tragedy.
\par 
\par We must now ask ourselves, what could be the ulterior aim of the
\par Euripidean design, which, in the highest ideality of its execution,
\par would found drama exclusively on the non-Dionysian? What other form of
\par drama could there be, if it was not to be born of the womb of music, in
\par the mysterious twilight of the Dionysian? Only _the dramatised epos:_
\par in which Apollonian domain of art the _tragic_ effect is of course
\par unattainable. It does not depend on the subject-matter of the events
\par here represented; indeed, I venture to assert that it would have been
\par impossible for Goethe in his projected "Nausikaa" to have rendered
\par tragically effective the suicide of the idyllic being with which he
\par intended to complete the fifth act; so extraordinary is the power of
\par the epic-Apollonian representation, that it charms, before our eyes,
\par the most terrible things by the joy in appearance and in redemption
\par through appearance. The poet of the dramatised epos cannot completely
\par blend with his pictures any more than the epic rhapsodist. He is still
\par just the calm, unmoved embodiment of Contemplation whose wide eyes see
\par the picture _before_ them. The actor in this dramatised epos still
\par remains intrinsically rhapsodist: the consecration of inner dreaming
\par is on all his actions, so that he is never wholly an actor.
\par 
\par How, then, is the Euripidean play related to this ideal of the
\par Apollonian drama? Just as the younger rhapsodist is related to the
\par solemn rhapsodist of the old time. The former describes his own
\par character in the Platonic "Ion" as follows: "When I am saying anything
\par sad, my eyes fill with tears; when, however, what I am saying is awful
\par and terrible, then my hair stands on end through fear, and my heart
\par leaps." Here we no longer observe anything of the epic absorption
\par in appearance, or of the unemotional coolness of the true actor,
\par who precisely in his highest activity is wholly appearance and joy
\par in appearance. Euripides is the actor with leaping heart, with hair
\par standing on end; as Socratic thinker he designs the plan, as passionate
\par actor he executes it. Neither in the designing nor in the execution is
\par he an artist pure and simple. And so the Euripidean drama is a thing
\par both cool and fiery, equally capable of freezing and burning; it is
\par impossible for it to attain the Apollonian, effect of the epos, while,
\par on the other hand, it has severed itself as much as possible from
\par Dionysian elements, and now, in order to act at all, it requires new
\par stimulants, which can no longer lie within the sphere of the two unique
\par art-impulses, the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The stimulants are
\par cool, paradoxical _thoughts_, in place of Apollonian intuitions--and
\par fiery _passions_--in place Dionysean ecstasies; and in fact, thoughts
\par and passions very realistically copied, and not at all steeped in the
\par ether of art.
\par 
\par Accordingly, if we have perceived this much, that Euripides did not
\par succeed in establishing the drama exclusively on the Apollonian, but
\par that rather his non-Dionysian inclinations deviated into a naturalistic
\par and inartistic tendency, we shall now be able to approach nearer to
\par the character _\'e6sthetic Socratism._ supreme law of which reads about
\par as follows: "to be beautiful everything must be intelligible," as
\par the parallel to the Socratic proposition, "only the knowing is one
\par virtuous." With this canon in his hands Euripides measured all the
\par separate elements of the drama, and rectified them according to his
\par principle: the language, the characters, the dramaturgic structure, and
\par the choric music. The poetic deficiency and retrogression, which we
\par are so often wont to impute to Euripides in comparison with Sophoclean
\par tragedy, is for the most part the product of this penetrating critical
\par process, this daring intelligibility. The Euripidian _prologue_ may
\par serve us as an example of the productivity of this, rationalistic
\par method. Nothing could be more opposed to the technique of our stage
\par than the prologue in the drama of Euripides. For a single person to
\par appear at the outset of the play telling us who he is, what precedes
\par the action, what has happened thus far, yea, what will happen in
\par the course of the play, would be designated by a modern playwright
\par as a wanton and unpardonable abandonment of the effect of suspense.
\par Everything that is about to happen is known beforehand; who then
\par cares to wait for it actually to happen?--considering, moreover, that
\par here there is not by any means the exciting relation of a predicting
\par dream to a reality taking place later on. Euripides speculated quite
\par differently. The effect of tragedy never depended on epic suspense, on
\par the fascinating uncertainty as to what is to happen now and afterwards:
\par but rather on the great rhetoro-lyric scenes in which the passion and
\par dialectics of the chief hero swelled to a broad and mighty stream.
\par Everything was arranged for pathos, not for action: and whatever
\par was not arranged for pathos was regarded as objectionable. But what
\par interferes most with the hearer's pleasurable satisfaction in such
\par scenes is a missing link, a gap in the texture of the previous history.
\par So long as the spectator has to divine the meaning of this or that
\par person, or the presuppositions of this or that conflict of inclinations
\par and intentions, his complete absorption in the doings and sufferings
\par of the chief persons is impossible, as is likewise breathless
\par fellow-feeling and fellow-fearing. The \'c6schyleo-Sophoclean tragedy
\par employed the most ingenious devices in the first scenes to place in
\par the hands of the spectator as if by chance all the threads requisite
\par for understanding the whole: a trait in which that noble artistry is
\par approved, which as it were masks the _inevitably_ formal, and causes
\par it to appear as something accidental. But nevertheless Euripides
\par thought he observed that during these first scenes the spectator was
\par in a strange state of anxiety to make out the problem of the previous
\par history, so that the poetic beauties and pathos of the exposition
\par were lost to him. Accordingly he placed the prologue even before the
\par exposition, and put it in the mouth of a person who could be trusted:
\par some deity had often as it were to guarantee the particulars of the
\par tragedy to the public and remove every doubt as to the reality of the
\par myth: as in the case of Descartes, who could only prove the reality
\par of the empiric world by an appeal to the truthfulness of God and His
\par inability to utter falsehood. Euripides makes use of the same divine
\par truthfulness once more at the close of his drama, in order to ensure to
\par the public the future of his heroes; this is the task of the notorious
\par _deus ex machina._ Between the preliminary and the additional epic
\par spectacle there is the dramatico-lyric present, the "drama" proper.
\par 
\par Thus Euripides as a poet echoes above all his own conscious
\par knowledge; and it is precisely on this account that he occupies such
\par a notable position in the history of Greek art. With reference to his
\par critico-productive activity, he must often have felt that he ought
\par to actualise in the drama the words at the beginning of the essay of
\par Anaxagoras: "In the beginning all things were mixed together; then
\par came the understanding and created order." And if Anaxagoras with his
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 "\'ed\'ef}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u8161\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'f2" seemed like the first sob}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 er person among nothing but drunken
\par philosophers, Euripides may also have conceived his relation to
\par the other tragic poets under a similar figure. As long as the sole
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 ruler and disposer of the universe, the \'ed\'ef}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 \u8161\'3f}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af64 \ltrch\fcs0 \f64 \'f2, was still excluded
\par }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2 from artistic activity, things were all mixed together in a chaotic,
\par primitive mess;--it is thus Euripides was obliged to think, it is thus
\par he was obliged to condemn the "drunken" poets as the first "sober" one
\par among them. What Sophocles said of \'c6schylus, that he did what was
\par right, though unconsciously, was surely not in the mind of Euripides:
\par who would have admitted only thus much, that \'c6schylus, _because_ he
\par wrought unconsciously, did what was wrong. So also the divine Plato
\par speaks for the most part only ironically of the creative faculty of the
\par poet, in so far as it is not conscious insight, and places it on a par
\par with the gift of the soothsayer and dream-interpreter; insinuating that
\par the poet is incapable of composing until he has become unconscious and
\par reason has deserted him. Like Plato, Euripides undertook to show to the
\par world the reverse of the "unintelligent" poet; his \'e6sthetic principle
\par that "to be beautiful everything must be known" is, as I have said,
\par the parallel to the Socratic "to be good everything must be known."
\par Accordingly we may regard Euripides as the poet of \'e6sthetic Socratism.
\par Socrates, however, was that _second spectator_ who did not comprehend
\par and therefore did not esteem the Old Tragedy; in alliance with him
\par Euripides ventured to be the herald of a new artistic activity. If,
\par then, the Old Tragedy was here destroyed, it follows that \'e6sthetic
\par Socratism was the murderous principle; but in so far as the struggle is
\par directed against the Dionysian element in the old art, we recognise in
\par Socrates the opponent of Dionysus, the new Orpheus who rebels against
\par Dionysus; and although destined to be torn to pieces by the M\'e6nads of
\par the Athenian court, yet puts to flight the overpowerful god himself,
\par who, when he fled from Lycurgus, the king of Edoni, sought refuge in
\par the depths of the ocean--namely, in the mystical flood of a secret
\par cult which gradually overspread the earth.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 13.
\par 
\par 
\par That Socrates stood in close relationship to Euripides in the tendency
\par of his teaching, did not escape the notice of contemporaneous
\par antiquity; the most eloquent expression of this felicitous insight
\par being the tale current in Athens, that Socrates was accustomed to help
\par Euripides in poetising. Both names were mentioned in one breath by the
\par adherents of the "good old time," whenever they came to enumerating the
\par popular agitators of the day: to whose influence they attributed the
\par fact that the old Marathonian stalwart capacity of body and soul was
\par more and more being sacrificed to a dubious enlightenment, involving
\par progressive degeneration of the physical and mental powers. It is in
\par this tone, half indignantly and half contemptuously, that Aristophanic
\par comedy is wont to speak of both of them--to the consternation of
\par modern men, who would indeed be willing enough to give up Euripides,
\par but cannot suppress their amazement that Socrates should appear in
\par Aristophanes as the first and head _sophist,_ as the mirror and epitome
\par of all sophistical tendencies; in connection with which it offers the
\par single consolation of putting Aristophanes himself in the pillory, as a
\par rakish, lying Alcibiades of poetry. Without here defending the profound
\par instincts of Aristophanes against such attacks, I shall now indicate,
\par by means of the sentiments of the time, the close connection between
\par Socrates and Euripides. With this purpose in view, it is especially to
\par be remembered that Socrates, as an opponent of tragic art, did not
\par ordinarily patronise tragedy, but only appeared among the spectators
\par when a new play of Euripides was performed. The most noted thing,
\par however, is the close juxtaposition of the two names in the Delphic
\par oracle, which designated Socrates as the wisest of men, but at the same
\par time decided that the second prize in the contest of wisdom was due to
\par Euripides.
\par 
\par Sophocles was designated as the third in this scale of rank; he who
\par could pride himself that, in comparison with \'c6schylus, he did what
\par was right, and did it, moreover, because he _knew_ what was right. It
\par is evidently just the degree of clearness of this _knowledge,_ which
\par distinguishes these three men in common as the three "knowing ones" of
\par their age.
\par 
\par The most decisive word, however, for this new and unprecedented
\par esteem of knowledge and insight was spoken by Socrates when he
\par found that he was the only one who acknowledged to himself that he
\par _knew nothing_ while in his critical pilgrimage through Athens, and
\par calling on the greatest statesmen, orators, poets, and artists, he
\par discovered everywhere the conceit of knowledge. He perceived, to his
\par astonishment, that all these celebrities were without a proper and
\par accurate insight, even with regard to their own callings, and practised
\par them only by instinct. "Only by instinct": with this phrase we touch
\par upon the heart and core of the Socratic tendency. Socratism condemns
\par therewith existing art as well as existing ethics; wherever Socratism
\par turns its searching eyes it beholds the lack of insight and the
\par power of illusion; and from this lack infers the inner perversity and
\par objectionableness of existing conditions. From this point onwards,
\par Socrates believed that he was called upon to, correct existence;
\par and, with an air of disregard and superiority, as the precursor
\par of an altogether different culture, art, and morality, he enters
\par single-handed into a world, of which, if we reverently touched the hem,
\par we should count it our greatest happiness.
\par 
\par Here is the extraordinary hesitancy which always seizes upon us with
\par regard to Socrates, and again and again invites us to ascertain the
\par sense and purpose of this most questionable phenomenon of antiquity.
\par Who is it that ventures single-handed to disown the Greek character,
\par which, as Homer, Pindar, and \'c6schylus, as Phidias, as Pericles, as
\par Pythia and Dionysus, as the deepest abyss and the highest height, is
\par sure of our wondering admiration? What demoniac power is it which would
\par presume to spill this magic draught in the dust? What demigod is it to
\par whom the chorus of spirits of the noblest of mankind must call out:
\par "Weh! Weh! Du hast sie zerst\'f6rt, die sch\'f6ne Welt, mit m\'e4chtiger Faust;
\par sie st\'fcrzt, sie zerf\'e4llt!"[17]
\par 
\par A key to the character of Socrates is presented to us by the surprising
\par phenomenon designated as the "daimonion" of Socrates. In special
\par circumstances, when his gigantic intellect began to stagger, he got
\par a secure support in the utterances of a divine voice which then
\par spake to him. This voice, whenever it comes, always _dissuades._
\par In this totally abnormal nature instinctive wisdom only appears in
\par order to hinder the progress of conscious perception here and there.
\par While in all productive men it is instinct which is the creatively
\par affirmative force, consciousness only comporting itself critically
\par and dissuasively; with Socrates it is instinct which becomes critic;
\par it is consciousness which becomes creator--a perfect monstrosity
\par _per defectum!_ And we do indeed observe here a monstrous _defectus_
\par of all mystical aptitude, so that Socrates might be designated as
\par the specific _non-mystic,_ in whom the logical nature is developed,
\par through a superfoetation, to the same excess as instinctive wisdom
\par is developed in the mystic. On the other hand, however, the logical
\par instinct which appeared in Socrates was absolutely prohibited from
\par turning against itself; in its unchecked flow it manifests a native
\par power such as we meet with, to our shocking surprise, only among the
\par very greatest instinctive forces. He who has experienced even a breath
\par of the divine na\'efvet\'e9 and security of the Socratic course of life in
\par the Platonic writings, will also feel that the enormous driving-wheel
\par of logical Socratism is in motion, as it were, _behind_ Socrates, and
\par that it must be viewed through Socrates as through a shadow. And
\par that he himself had a boding of this relation is apparent from the
\par dignified earnestness with which he everywhere, and even before his
\par judges, insisted on his divine calling. To refute him here was really
\par as impossible as to approve of his instinct-disintegrating influence.
\par In view of this indissoluble conflict, when he had at last been brought
\par before the forum of the Greek state, there was only one punishment
\par demanded, namely exile; he might have been sped across the borders as
\par something thoroughly enigmatical, irrubricable and inexplicable, and so
\par posterity would have been quite unjustified in charging the Athenians
\par with a deed of ignominy. But that the sentence of death, and not mere
\par exile, was pronounced upon him, seems to have been brought about by
\par Socrates himself, with perfect knowledge of the circumstances, and
\par without the natural fear of death: he met his death with the calmness
\par with which, according to the description of Plato, he leaves the
\par symposium at break of day, as the last of the revellers, to begin a new
\par day; while the sleepy companions remain behind on the benches and the
\par floor, to dream of Socrates, the true eroticist. _The dying Socrates_
\par became the new ideal of the noble Greek youths,--an ideal they had
\par never yet beheld,--and above all, the typical Hellenic youth, Plato,
\par prostrated himself before this scene with all the fervent devotion of
\par his visionary soul.
\par 
\par 
\par [17]
\par 
\par     Woe! Woe!
\par     Thou hast it destroyed,
\par     The beautiful world;
\par     With powerful fist;
\par     In ruin 'tis hurled!

\par 14.
\par 
\par 
\par Let us now imagine the one great Cyclopean eye of Socrates fixed on
\par tragedy, that eye in which the fine frenzy of artistic enthusiasm had
\par never glowed--let us think how it was denied to this eye to gaze with
\par pleasure into the Dionysian abysses--what could it not but see in the
\par "sublime and greatly lauded" tragic art, as Plato called it? Something
\par very absurd, with causes that seemed to be without effects, and
\par effects apparently without causes; the whole, moreover, so motley and
\par diversified that it could not but be repugnant to a thoughtful mind, a
\par dangerous incentive, however, to sensitive and irritable souls. We know
\par what was the sole kind of poetry which he comprehended: the _\'c6sopian
\par fable_: and he did this no doubt with that smiling complaisance with
\par which the good honest Gellert sings the praise of poetry in the fable
\par of the bee and the hen:--
\par 
\par     "Du siehst an mir, wozu sie n\'fctzt,
\par     Dem, der nicht viel Verstand besitzt,
\par     Die Wahrheit durch ein Bild zu sagen."[18]
\par 
\par But then it seemed to Socrates that tragic art did not even "tell the
\par truth": not to mention the fact that it addresses itself to him who
\par "hath but little wit"; consequently not to the philosopher: a twofold
\par reason why it should be avoided. Like Plato, he reckoned it among the
\par seductive arts which only represent the agreeable, not the useful, and
\par hence he required of his disciples abstinence and strict separation
\par from such unphilosophical allurements; with such success that the
\par youthful tragic poet Plato first of all burned his poems to be able to
\par become a scholar of Socrates. But where unconquerable native capacities
\par bore up against the Socratic maxims, their power, together with the
\par momentum of his mighty character, still sufficed to force poetry itself
\par into new and hitherto unknown channels.
\par 
\par An instance of this is the aforesaid Plato: he, who in the condemnation
\par of tragedy and of art in general certainly did not fall short of
\par the na\'efve cynicism of his master, was nevertheless constrained by
\par sheer artistic necessity to create a form of art which is inwardly
\par related even to the then existing forms of art which he repudiated.
\par Plato's main objection to the old art--that it is the imitation of
\par a phantom,[19] and hence belongs to a sphere still lower than the
\par empiric world--could not at all apply to the new art: and so we find
\par Plato endeavouring to go beyond reality and attempting to represent
\par the idea which underlies this pseudo-reality. But Plato, the thinker,
\par thereby arrived by a roundabout road just at the point where he had
\par always been at home as poet, and from which Sophocles and all the old
\par artists had solemnly protested against that objection. If tragedy
\par absorbed into itself all the earlier varieties of art, the same
\par could again be said in an unusual sense of Platonic dialogue, which,
\par engendered by a mixture of all the then existing forms and styles,
\par hovers midway between narrative, lyric and drama, between prose and
\par poetry, and has also thereby broken loose from the older strict law
\par of unity of linguistic form; a movement which was carried still
\par farther by the _cynic_ writers, who in the most promiscuous style,
\par oscillating to and fro betwixt prose and metrical forms, realised also
\par the literary picture of the "raving Socrates" whom they were wont to
\par represent in life. Platonic dialogue was as it were the boat in which
\par the shipwrecked ancient poetry saved herself together with all her
\par children: crowded into a narrow space and timidly obsequious to the
\par one steersman, Socrates, they now launched into a new world, which
\par never tired of looking at the fantastic spectacle of this procession.
\par In very truth, Plato has given to all posterity the prototype of a new
\par form of art, the prototype of the _novel_ which must be designated as
\par the infinitely evolved \'c6sopian fable, in which poetry holds the same
\par rank with reference to dialectic philosophy as this same philosophy
\par held for many centuries with reference to theology: namely, the rank of
\par _ancilla._ This was the new position of poetry into which Plato forced
\par it under the pressure of the demon-inspired Socrates.
\par 
\par Here _philosophic thought_ overgrows art and compels it to cling close
\par to the trunk of dialectics. The _Apollonian_ tendency has chrysalised
\par in the logical schematism; just as something analogous in the case
\par of Euripides (and moreover a translation of the _Dionysian_ into the
\par naturalistic emotion) was forced upon our attention. Socrates, the
\par dialectical hero in Platonic drama, reminds us of the kindred nature
\par of the Euripidean hero, who has to defend his actions by arguments and
\par counter-arguments, and thereby so often runs the risk of forfeiting
\par our tragic pity; for who could mistake the _optimistic_ element
\par in the essence of dialectics, which celebrates a jubilee in every
\par conclusion, and can breathe only in cool clearness and consciousness:
\par the optimistic element, which, having once forced its way into tragedy,
\par must gradually overgrow its Dionysian regions, and necessarily impel it
\par to self-destruction--even to the death-leap into the bourgeois drama.
\par Let us but realise the consequences of the Socratic maxims: "Virtue is
\par knowledge; man only sins from ignorance; he who is virtuous is happy":
\par these three fundamental forms of optimism involve the death of tragedy.
\par For the virtuous hero must now be a dialectician; there must now be a
\par necessary, visible connection between virtue and knowledge, between
\par belief and morality; the transcendental justice of the plot in \'c6schylus
\par is now degraded to the superficial and audacious principle of poetic
\par justice with its usual _deus ex machina_.
\par 
\par How does the _chorus,_ and, in general, the entire Dionyso-musical
\par substratum of tragedy, now appear in the light of this new
\par Socrato-optimistic stage-world? As something accidental, as a readily
\par dispensable reminiscence of the origin of tragedy; while we have
\par in fact seen that the chorus can be understood only as the cause of
\par tragedy, and of the tragic generally. This perplexity with respect to
\par the chorus first manifests itself in Sophocles--an important sign that
\par the Dionysian basis of tragedy already begins to disintegrate with
\par him. He no longer ventures to entrust to the chorus the main share
\par of the effect, but limits its sphere to such an extent that it now
\par appears almost co-ordinate with the actors, just as if it were elevated
\par from the orchestra into the scene: whereby of course its character
\par is completely destroyed, notwithstanding that Aristotle countenances
\par this very theory of the chorus. This alteration of the position of
\par the chorus, which Sophocles at any rate recommended by his practice,
\par and, according to tradition, even by a treatise, is the first step
\par towards the _annihilation_ of the chorus, the phases of which follow
\par one another with alarming rapidity in Euripides, Agathon, and the New
\par Comedy. Optimistic dialectics drives, _music_ out of tragedy with the
\par scourge of its syllogisms: that is, it destroys the essence of tragedy,
\par which can be explained only as a manifestation and illustration of
\par Dionysian states, as the visible symbolisation of music, as the
\par dream-world of Dionysian ecstasy.
\par 
\par If, therefore, we are to assume an anti-Dionysian tendency operating
\par even before Socrates, which received in him only an unprecedentedly
\par grand expression, we must not shrink from the question as to what
\par a phenomenon like that of Socrates indicates: whom in view of the
\par Platonic dialogues we are certainly not entitled to regard as a purely
\par disintegrating, negative power. And though there can be no doubt
\par whatever that the most immediate effect of the Socratic impulse tended
\par to the dissolution of Dionysian tragedy, yet a profound experience of
\par Socrates' own life compels us to ask whether there is _necessarily_
\par only an antipodal relation between Socratism and art, and whether the
\par birth of an "artistic Socrates" is in general something contradictory
\par in itself.
\par 
\par For that despotic logician had now and then the feeling of a gap, or
\par void, a sentiment of semi-reproach, as of a possibly neglected duty
\par with respect to art. There often came to him, as he tells his friends
\par in prison, one and the same dream-apparition, which kept constantly
\par repeating to him: "Socrates, practise music." Up to his very last days
\par he solaces himself with the opinion that his philosophising is the
\par highest form of poetry, and finds it hard to believe that a deity will
\par remind him of the "common, popular music." Finally, when in prison,
\par he consents to practise also this despised music, in order thoroughly
\par to unburden his conscience. And in this frame of mind he composes
\par a poem on Apollo and turns a few \'c6sopian fables into verse. It was
\par something similar to the demonian warning voice which urged him to
\par these practices; it was because of his Apollonian insight that, like a
\par barbaric king, he did not understand the noble image of a god and was
\par in danger of sinning against a deity--through ignorance. The prompting
\par voice of the Socratic dream-vision is the only sign of doubtfulness
\par as to the limits of logical nature. "Perhaps "--thus he had to ask
\par himself--"what is not intelligible to me is not therefore unreasonable?
\par Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is banished?
\par Perhaps art is even a necessary correlative of and supplement to
\par science?"

\par 
\par In the sense of these last portentous questions it must now be
\par indicated how the influence of Socrates (extending to the present
\par moment, indeed, to all futurity) has spread over posterity like an
\par ever-increasing shadow in the evening sun, and how this influence
\par again and again necessitates a regeneration of _art,_--yea, of art
\par already with metaphysical, broadest and profoundest sense,--and its own
\par eternity guarantees also the eternity of art.
\par 
\par Before this could be perceived, before the intrinsic dependence of
\par every art on the Greeks, the Greeks from Homer to Socrates, was
\par conclusively demonstrated, it had to happen to us with regard to these
\par Greeks as it happened to the Athenians with regard to Socrates. Nearly
\par every age and stage of culture has at some time or other sought with
\par deep displeasure to free itself from the Greeks, because in their
\par presence everything self-achieved, sincerely admired and apparently
\par quite original, seemed all of a sudden to lose life and colour
\par and shrink to an abortive copy, even to caricature. And so hearty
\par indignation breaks forth time after time against this presumptuous
\par little nation, which dared to designate as "barbaric" for all time
\par everything not native: who are they, one asks one's self, who, though
\par they possessed only an ephemeral historical splendour, ridiculously
\par restricted institutions, a dubious excellence in their customs, and
\par were even branded with ugly vices, yet lay claim to the dignity and
\par singular position among the peoples to which genius is entitled among
\par the masses. What a pity one has not been so fortunate as to find the
\par cup of hemlock with which such an affair could be disposed of without
\par ado: for all the poison which envy, calumny, and rankling resentment
\par engendered within themselves have not sufficed to destroy that
\par self-sufficient grandeur! And so one feels ashamed and afraid in the
\par presence of the Greeks: unless one prize truth above all things, and
\par dare also to acknowledge to one's self this truth, that the Greeks,
\par as charioteers, hold in their hands the reins of our own and of
\par every culture, but that almost always chariot and horses are of too
\par poor material and incommensurate with the glory of their guides, who
\par then will deem it sport to run such a team into an abyss: which they
\par themselves clear with the leap of Achilles.
\par 
\par In order to assign also to Socrates the dignity of such a leading
\par position, it will suffice to recognise in him the type of an unheard-of
\par form of existence, the type of the _theoretical man,_ with regard
\par to whose meaning and purpose it will be our next task to attain
\par an insight. Like the artist, the theorist also finds an infinite
\par satisfaction in what _is_ and, like the former, he is shielded by this
\par satisfaction from the practical ethics of pessimism with its lynx eyes
\par which shine only in the dark. For if the artist in every unveiling
\par of truth always cleaves with raptured eyes only to that which still
\par remains veiled after the unveiling, the theoretical man, on the other
\par hand, enjoys and contents himself with the cast-off veil, and finds
\par the consummation of his pleasure in the process of a continuously
\par successful unveiling through his own unaided efforts. There would
\par have been no science if it had only been concerned about that _one_
\par naked goddess and nothing else. For then its disciples would have been
\par obliged to feel like those who purposed to dig a hole straight through
\par the earth: each one of whom perceives that with the utmost lifelong
\par exertion he is able to excavate only a very little of the enormous
\par depth, which is again filled up before his eyes by the labours of his
\par successor, so that a third man seems to do well when on his own account
\par he selects a new spot for his attempts at tunnelling. If now some one
\par proves conclusively that the antipodal goal cannot be attained in this
\par direct way, who will still care to toil on in the old depths, unless he
\par has learned to content himself in the meantime with finding precious
\par stones or discovering natural laws? For that reason Lessing, the most
\par honest theoretical man, ventured to say that he cared more for the
\par search after truth than for truth itself: in saying which he revealed
\par the fundamental secret of science, to the astonishment, and indeed,
\par to the vexation of scientific men. Well, to be sure, there stands
\par alongside of this detached perception, as an excess of honesty, if not
\par of presumption, a profound _illusion_ which first came to the world
\par in the person of Socrates, the imperturbable belief that, by means
\par of the clue of causality, thinking reaches to the deepest abysses of
\par being, and that thinking is able not only to perceive being but even
\par to _correct_ it. This sublime metaphysical illusion is added as an
\par instinct to science and again and again leads the latter to its limits,
\par where it must change into _art; which is really the end, to be attained
\par by this mechanism_.
\par 
\par If we now look at Socrates in the light of this thought, he appears to
\par us as the first who could not only live, but--what is far more--also
\par die under the guidance of this instinct of science: and hence the
\par picture of the _dying, Socrates_, as the man delivered from the fear of
\par death by knowledge and argument, is the escutcheon, above the entrance
\par to science which reminds every one of its mission, namely, to make
\par existence appear to be comprehensible, and therefore to be justified:
\par for which purpose, if arguments do not suffice, _myth_ also must be
\par used, which I just now designated even as the necessary consequence,
\par yea, as the end of science.
\par 
\par He who once makes intelligible to himself how, after the death of
\par Socrates, the mystagogue of science, one philosophical school succeeds
\par another, like wave upon wave,--how an entirely unfore-shadowed
\par universal development of the thirst for knowledge in the widest
\par compass of the cultured world (and as the specific task for every
\par one highly gifted) led science on to the high sea from which since
\par then it has never again been able to be completely ousted; how
\par through the universality of this movement a common net of thought
\par was first stretched over the entire globe, with prospects, moreover,
\par of conformity to law in an entire solar system;--he who realises all
\par this, together with the amazingly high pyramid of our present-day
\par knowledge, cannot fail to see in Socrates the turning-point and vortex
\par of so-called universal history. For if one were to imagine the whole
\par incalculable sum of energy which has been used up by that universal
\par tendency,--employed, _not_ in the service of knowledge, but for the
\par practical, _i.e.,_ egoistical ends of individuals and peoples,--then
\par probably the instinctive love of life would be so much weakened in
\par universal wars of destruction and incessant migrations of peoples,
\par that, owing to the practice of suicide, the individual would perhaps
\par feel the last remnant of a sense of duty, when, like the native of
\par the Fiji Islands, as son he strangles his parents and, as friend, his
\par friend: a practical pessimism which might even give rise to a horrible
\par ethics of general slaughter out of pity--which, for the rest, exists
\par and has existed wherever art in one form or another, especially as
\par science and religion, has not appeared as a remedy and preventive of
\par that pestilential breath.
\par 
\par In view of this practical pessimism, Socrates is the archetype of
\par the theoretical optimist, who in the above-indicated belief in the
\par fathomableness of the nature of things, attributes to knowledge and
\par perception the power of a universal medicine, and sees in error and
\par evil. To penetrate into the depths of the nature of things, and to
\par separate true perception from error and illusion, appeared to the
\par Socratic man the noblest and even the only truly human calling: just as
\par from the time of Socrates onwards the mechanism of concepts, judgments,
\par and inferences was prized above all other capacities as the highest
\par activity and the most admirable gift of nature. Even the sublimest
\par moral acts, the stirrings of pity, of self-sacrifice, of heroism,
\par and that tranquillity of soul, so difficult of attainment, which the
\par Apollonian Greek called Sophrosyne, were derived by Socrates, and his
\par like-minded successors up to the present day, from the dialectics of
\par knowledge, and were accordingly designated as teachable. He who has
\par experienced in himself the joy of a Socratic perception, and felt how
\par it seeks to embrace, in constantly widening circles, the entire world
\par of phenomena, will thenceforth find no stimulus which could urge him
\par to existence more forcible than the desire to complete that conquest
\par and to knit the net impenetrably close. To a person thus minded the
\par Platonic Socrates then appears as the teacher of an entirely new form
\par of "Greek cheerfulness" and felicity of existence, which seeks to
\par discharge itself in actions, and will find its discharge for the most
\par part in maieutic and pedagogic influences on noble youths, with a view
\par to the ultimate production of genius.
\par 
\par But now science, spurred on by its powerful illusion, hastens
\par irresistibly to its limits, on which its optimism, hidden in the
\par essence of logic, is wrecked. For the periphery of the circle of
\par science has an infinite number of points, and while there is still no
\par telling how this circle can ever be completely measured, yet the noble
\par and gifted man, even before the middle of his career, inevitably comes
\par into contact with those extreme points of the periphery where he stares
\par at the inexplicable. When he here sees to his dismay how logic coils
\par round itself at these limits and finally bites its own tail--then the
\par new form of perception discloses itself, namely _tragic perception,_
\par which, in order even to be endured, requires art as a safeguard and
\par remedy.
\par 
\par If, with eyes strengthened and refreshed at the sight of the Greeks, we
\par look upon the highest spheres of the world that surrounds us, we behold
\par the avidity of the insatiate optimistic knowledge, of which Socrates is
\par the typical representative, transformed into tragic resignation and the
\par need of art: while, to be sure, this same avidity, in its lower stages,
\par has to exhibit itself as antagonistic to art, and must especially have
\par an inward detestation of Dionyso-tragic art, as was exemplified in the
\par opposition of Socratism to \'c6schylean tragedy.
\par 
\par Here then with agitated spirit we knock at the gates of the present and
\par the future: will that "transforming" lead to ever new configurations
\par of genius, and especially of the _music-practising Socrates_? Will the
\par net of art which is spread over existence, whether under the name of
\par religion or of science, be knit always more closely and delicately,
\par or is it destined to be torn to shreds under the restlessly barbaric
\par activity and whirl which is called "the present day"?--Anxious, yet
\par not disconsolate, we stand aloof for a little while, as the spectators
\par who are permitted to be witnesses of these tremendous struggles and
\par transitions. Alas! It is the charm of these struggles that he who
\par beholds them must also fight them!
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 16.
\par 
\par 
\par By this elaborate historical example we have endeavoured to make it
\par clear that tragedy perishes as surely by evanescence of the spirit of
\par music as it can be born only out of this spirit. In order to qualify
\par the singularity of this assertion, and, on the other hand, to disclose
\par the source of this insight of ours, we must now confront with clear
\par vision the analogous phenomena of the present time; we must enter
\par into the midst of these struggles, which, as I said just now, are
\par being carried on in the highest spheres of our present world between
\par the insatiate optimistic perception and the tragic need of art. In
\par so doing I shall leave out of consideration all other antagonistic
\par tendencies which at all times oppose art, especially tragedy, and which
\par at present again extend their sway triumphantly, to such an extent that
\par of the theatrical arts only the farce and the ballet, for example, put
\par forth their blossoms, which perhaps not every one cares to smell, in
\par tolerably rich luxuriance. I will speak only of the _Most Illustrious
\par Opposition_ to the tragic conception of things--and by this I mean
\par essentially optimistic science, with its ancestor Socrates at the head
\par of it. Presently also the forces will be designated which seem to me
\par to guarantee _a re-birth of tragedy_--and who knows what other blessed
\par hopes for the German genius!
\par 
\par Before we plunge into the midst of these struggles, let us array
\par ourselves in the armour of our hitherto acquired knowledge. In
\par contrast to all those who are intent on deriving the arts from one
\par exclusive principle, as the necessary vital source of every work of
\par art, I keep my eyes fixed on the two artistic deities of the Greeks,
\par Apollo and Dionysus, and recognise in them the living and conspicuous
\par representatives of _two_ worlds of art which differ in their intrinsic
\par essence and in their highest aims. Apollo stands before me as the
\par transfiguring genius of the _principium individuationis_ through
\par which alone the redemption in appearance is to be truly attained,
\par while by the mystical cheer of Dionysus the spell of individuation
\par is broken, and the way lies open to the Mothers of Being,[20] to the
\par innermost heart of things. This extraordinary antithesis, which opens
\par up yawningly between plastic art as the Apollonian and music as the
\par Dionysian art, has become manifest to only one of the great thinkers,
\par to such an extent that, even without this key to the symbolism of the
\par Hellenic divinities, he allowed to music a different character and
\par origin in advance of all the other arts, because, unlike them, it is
\par not a copy of the phenomenon, but a direct copy of the will itself, and
\par therefore represents _the metaphysical of everything physical in the
\par world_, the thing-in-itself of every phenomenon. (Schopenhauer, _Welt
\par als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. 310.) To this most important perception
\par of \'e6sthetics (with which, taken in a serious sense, \'e6sthetics properly
\par commences), Richard Wagner, by way of confirmation of its eternal
\par truth, affixed his seal, when he asserted in his _Beethoven_ that
\par music must be judged according to \'e6sthetic principles quite different
\par from those which apply to the plastic arts, and not, in general,
\par according to the category of beauty: although an erroneous \'e6sthetics,
\par inspired by a misled and degenerate art, has by virtue of the concept
\par of beauty prevailing in the plastic domain accustomed itself to demand
\par of music an effect analogous to that of the works of plastic art,
\par namely the suscitating _delight in beautiful forms._ Upon perceiving
\par this extraordinary antithesis, I felt a strong inducement to approach
\par the essence of Greek tragedy, and, by means of it, the profoundest
\par revelation of Hellenic genius: for I at last thought myself to be in
\par possession of a charm to enable me--far beyond the phraseology of our
\par usual \'e6sthetics--to represent vividly to my mind the primitive problem
\par of tragedy: whereby such an astounding insight into the Hellenic
\par character was afforded me that it necessarily seemed as if our proudly
\par comporting classico-Hellenic science had thus far contrived to subsist
\par almost exclusively on phantasmagoria and externalities.
\par 
\par Perhaps we may lead up to this primitive problem with the question:
\par what \'e6sthetic effect results when the intrinsically separate
\par art-powers, the Apollonian and the Dionysian, enter into concurrent
\par actions? Or, in briefer form: how is music related to image and
\par concept?--Schopenhauer, whom Richard Wagner, with especial reference to
\par this point, accredits with an unsurpassable clearness and perspicuity
\par of exposition, expresses himself most copiously on the subject in
\par the following passage which I shall cite here at full length[21]
\par (_Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. p. 309): "According to all
\par this, we may regard the phenomenal world, or nature, and music as
\par two different expressions of the same thing,[20] which is therefore
\par itself the only medium of the analogy between these two expressions,
\par so that a knowledge of this medium is required in order to understand
\par that analogy. Music, therefore, if regarded as an expression of the
\par world, is in the highest degree a universal language, which is related
\par indeed to the universality of concepts, much as these are related to
\par the particular things. Its universality, however, is by no means the
\par empty universality of abstraction, but of quite a different kind, and
\par is united with thorough and distinct definiteness. In this respect it
\par resembles geometrical figures and numbers, which are the universal
\par forms of all possible objects of experience and applicable to them all
\par _a priori_, and yet are not abstract but perceptiple and thoroughly
\par determinate. All possible efforts, excitements and manifestations of
\par will, all that goes on in the heart of man and that reason includes in
\par the wide, negative concept of feeling, may be expressed by the infinite
\par number of possible melodies, but always in the universality of mere
\par form, without the material, always according to the thing-in-itself,
\par not the phenomenon,--of which they reproduce the very soul and essence
\par as it were, without the body. This deep relation which music bears to
\par the true nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable
\par music played to any scene, action, event, or surrounding seems to
\par disclose to us its most secret meaning, and appears as the most
\par accurate and distinct commentary upon it; as also the fact that whoever
\par gives himself up entirely to the impression of a symphony seems to see
\par all the possible events of life and the world take place in himself:
\par nevertheless upon reflection he can find no likeness between the music
\par and the things that passed before his mind. For, as we have said, music
\par is distinguished from all the other arts by the fact that it is not a
\par copy of the phenomenon, or, more accurately, the adequate objectivity
\par of the will, but the direct copy of the will itself, and therefore
\par represents the metaphysical of everything physical in the world, and
\par the thing-in-itself of every phenomenon. We might, therefore, just as
\par well call the world embodied music as embodied will: and this is the
\par reason why music makes every picture, and indeed every scene of real
\par life and of the world, at once appear with higher significance; all the
\par more so, to be sure, in proportion as its melody is analogous to the
\par inner spirit of the given phenomenon. It rests upon this that we are
\par able to set a poem to music as a song, or a perceptible representation
\par as a pantomime, or both as an opera. Such particular pictures of human
\par life, set to the universal language of music, are never bound to it
\par or correspond to it with stringent necessity, but stand to it only
\par in the relation of an example chosen at will to a general concept.
\par In the determinateness of the real they represent that which music
\par expresses in the universality of mere form. For melodies are to a
\par certain extent, like general concepts, an abstraction from the actual.
\par This actual world, then, the world of particular things, affords the
\par object of perception, the special and the individual, the particular
\par case, both to the universality of concepts and to the universality of
\par the melodies. But these two universalities are in a certain respect
\par opposed to each other; for the concepts contain only the forms, which
\par are first of all abstracted from perception,--the separated outward
\par shell of things, as it were,--and hence they are, in the strictest
\par sense of the term, _abstracta_; music, on the other hand, gives the
\par inmost kernel which precedes all forms, or the heart of things. This
\par relation may be very well expressed in the language of the schoolmen,
\par by saying: the concepts are the _universalia post rem,_ but music gives
\par the _universalia ante rem,_ and the real world the _universalia in
\par re._--But that in general a relation is possible between a composition
\par and a perceptible representation rests, as we have said, upon the
\par fact that both are simply different expressions of the same inner
\par being of the world. When now, in the particular case, such a relation
\par is actually given, that is to say, when the composer has been able to
\par express in the universal language of music the emotions of will which
\par constitute the heart of an event, then the melody of the song, the
\par music of the opera, is expressive. But the analogy discovered by the
\par composer between the two must have proceeded from the direct knowledge
\par of the nature of the world unknown to his reason, and must not be an
\par imitation produced with conscious intention by means of conceptions;
\par otherwise the music does not express the inner nature of the will
\par itself, but merely gives an inadequate imitation of its phenomenon: all
\par specially imitative music does this."
\par 
\par We have therefore, according to the doctrine of Schopenhauer, an
\par immediate understanding of music as the language of the will, and
\par feel our imagination stimulated to give form to this invisible and
\par yet so actively stirred spirit-world which speaks to us, and prompted
\par to embody it in an analogous example. On the other hand, image and
\par concept, under the influence of a truly conformable music, acquire a
\par higher significance. Dionysian art therefore is wont to exercise--two
\par kinds of influences, on the Apollonian art-faculty: music firstly
\par incites to the _symbolic intuition_ of Dionysian universality, and,
\par secondly, it causes the symbolic image to stand forth _in its fullest
\par significance._ From these facts, intelligible in themselves and not
\par inaccessible to profounder observation, I infer the capacity of music
\par to give birth to _myth,_ that is to say, the most significant exemplar,
\par and precisely _tragic_ myth: the myth which speaks of Dionysian
\par knowledge in symbols. In the phenomenon of the lyrist, I have set forth
\par that in him music strives to express itself with regard to its nature
\par in Apollonian images. If now we reflect that music in its highest
\par potency must seek to attain also to its highest symbolisation, we must
\par deem it possible that it also knows how to find the symbolic expression
\par of its inherent Dionysian wisdom; and where shall we have to seek for
\par this expression if not in tragedy and, in general, in the conception of
\par the _tragic_?
\par 
\par From the nature of art, as it is ordinarily conceived according to
\par the single category of appearance and beauty, the tragic cannot be
\par honestly deduced at all; it is only through the spirit of music that
\par we understand the joy in the annihilation of the individual. For in
\par the particular examples of such annihilation only is the eternal
\par phenomenon of Dionysian art made clear to us, which gives expression
\par to the will in its omnipotence, as it were, behind the _principium
\par individuationis,_ the eternal life beyond all phenomena, and in
\par spite of all annihilation. The metaphysical delight in the tragic
\par is a translation of the instinctively unconscious Dionysian wisdom
\par into the language of the scene: the hero, the highest manifestation
\par of the will, is disavowed for our pleasure, because he is only
\par phenomenon, and because the eternal life of the will is not affected
\par by his annihilation. "We believe in eternal life," tragedy exclaims;
\par while music is the proximate idea of this life. Plastic art has an
\par altogether different object: here Apollo vanquishes the suffering of
\par the individual by the radiant glorification of the _eternity of the
\par phenomenon_; here beauty triumphs over the suffering inherent in life;
\par pain is in a manner surreptitiously obliterated from the features of
\par nature. In Dionysian art and its tragic symbolism the same nature
\par speaks to us with its true undissembled voice: "Be as I am! Amidst the
\par ceaseless change of phenomena the eternally creative primordial mother,
\par eternally impelling to existence, self-satisfying eternally with this
\par change of phenomena!"
\par 
\par 
\par [20] Cf. _World and Will as Idea,_ I. p. 339, trans. by
\par Haldane and Kemp.
\par 
\par [21] That is "the will" as understood by Schopenhauer.--TR.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 17.
\par 
\par 
\par Dionysian art, too, seeks to convince us of the eternal joy of
\par existence: only we are to seek this joy not in phenomena, but behind
\par phenomena. We are to perceive how all that comes into being must be
\par ready for a sorrowful end; we are compelled to look into the terrors of
\par individual existence--yet we are not to become torpid: a metaphysical
\par comfort tears us momentarily from the bustle of the transforming
\par figures. We are really for brief moments Primordial Being itself,
\par and feel its indomitable desire for being and joy in existence; the
\par struggle, the pain, the destruction of phenomena, now appear to us as
\par something necessary, considering the surplus of innumerable forms of
\par existence which throng and push one another into life, considering
\par the exuberant fertility of the universal will. We are pierced by the
\par maddening sting of these pains at the very moment when we have become,
\par as it were, one with the immeasurable primordial joy in existence,
\par and when we anticipate, in Dionysian ecstasy, the indestructibility
\par and eternity of this joy. In spite of fear and pity, we are the happy
\par living beings, not as individuals, but as the _one_ living being, with
\par whose procreative joy we are blended.
\par 
\par The history of the rise of Greek tragedy now tells us with luminous
\par precision that the tragic art of the Greeks was really born of the
\par spirit of music: with which conception we believe we have done justice
\par for the first time to the original and most astonishing significance of
\par the chorus. At the same time, however, we must admit that the import of
\par tragic myth as set forth above never became transparent with sufficient
\par lucidity to the Greek poets, let alone the Greek philosophers; their
\par heroes speak, as it were, more superficially than they act; the myth
\par does not at all find its adequate objectification in the spoken word.
\par The structure of the scenes and the conspicuous images reveal a deeper
\par wisdom than the poet himself can put into words and concepts: the same
\par being also observed in Shakespeare, whose Hamlet, for instance, in an
\par analogous manner talks more superficially than he acts, so that the
\par previously mentioned lesson of Hamlet is to be gathered not from his
\par words, but from a more profound contemplation and survey of the whole.
\par With respect to Greek tragedy, which of course presents itself to us
\par only as word-drama, I have even intimated that the incongruence between
\par myth and expression might easily tempt us to regard it as shallower
\par and less significant than it really is, and accordingly to postulate
\par for it a more superficial effect than it must have had according to
\par the testimony of the ancients: for how easily one forgets that what
\par the word-poet did not succeed in doing, namely realising the highest
\par spiritualisation and ideality of myth, he might succeed in doing
\par every moment as creative musician! We require, to be sure, almost by
\par philological method to reconstruct for ourselves the ascendency of
\par musical influence in order to receive something of the incomparable
\par comfort which must be characteristic of true tragedy. Even this musical
\par ascendency, however, would only have been felt by us as such had
\par we been Greeks: while in the entire development of Greek music--as
\par compared with the infinitely richer music known and familiar to us--we
\par imagine we hear only the youthful song of the musical genius intoned
\par with a feeling of diffidence. The Greeks are, as the Egyptian priests
\par say, eternal children, and in tragic art also they are only children
\par who do not know what a sublime play-thing has originated under their
\par hands and--is being demolished.
\par 
\par That striving of the spirit of music for symbolic and mythical
\par manifestation, which increases from the beginnings of lyric poetry to
\par Attic tragedy, breaks off all of a sudden immediately after attaining
\par luxuriant development, and disappears, as it were, from the surface
\par of Hellenic art: while the Dionysian view of things born of this
\par striving lives on in Mysteries and, in its strangest metamorphoses and
\par debasements, does not cease to attract earnest natures. Will it not one
\par day rise again as art out of its mystic depth?
\par 
\par Here the question occupies us, whether the power by the counteracting
\par influence of which tragedy perished, has for all time strength enough
\par to prevent the artistic reawaking of tragedy and of the tragic view
\par of things. If ancient tragedy was driven from its course by the
\par dialectical desire for knowledge and the optimism of science, it might
\par be inferred that there is an eternal conflict between _the theoretic_
\par and _the tragic view of things,_ and only after the spirit of science
\par has been led to its boundaries, and its claim to universal validity
\par has been destroyed by the evidence of these boundaries, can we hope
\par for a re-birth of tragedy: for which form of culture we should have to
\par use the symbol _of the music-practising Socrates_ in the sense spoken
\par of above. In this contrast, I understand by the spirit of science the
\par belief which first came to light in the person of Socrates,--the belief
\par in the fathomableness of nature and in knowledge as a panacea.
\par 
\par He who recalls the immediate consequences of this restlessly
\par onward-pressing spirit of science will realise at once that _myth_
\par was annihilated by it, and that, in consequence of this annihilation,
\par poetry was driven as a homeless being from her natural ideal soil.
\par If we have rightly assigned to music the capacity to reproduce myth
\par from itself, we may in turn expect to find the spirit of science on
\par the path where it inimically opposes this mythopoeic power of music.
\par This takes place in the development of the _New Attic Dithyramb,_ the
\par music of which no longer expressed the inner essence, the will itself,
\par but only rendered the phenomenon insufficiently, in an imitation by
\par means of concepts; from which intrinsically degenerate music the truly
\par musical natures turned away with the same repugnance that they felt
\par for the art-destroying tendency of Socrates. The unerring instinct of
\par Aristophanes surely did the proper thing when it comprised Socrates
\par himself, the tragedy of Euripides, and the music of the new Dithyrambic
\par poets in the same feeling of hatred, and perceived in all three
\par phenomena the symptoms of a degenerate culture. By this New Dithyramb,
\par music has in an outrageous manner been made the imitative portrait of
\par phenomena, for instance, of a battle or a storm at sea, and has thus,
\par of course, been entirely deprived of its mythopoeic power. For if it
\par endeavours to excite our delight only by compelling us to seek external
\par analogies between a vital or natural process and certain rhythmical
\par figures and characteristic sounds of music; if our understanding is
\par expected to satisfy itself with the perception of these analogies, we
\par are reduced to a frame of mind in which the reception of the mythical
\par is impossible; for the myth as a unique exemplar of generality
\par and truth towering into the infinite, desires to be conspicuously
\par perceived. The truly Dionysean music presents itself to us as such
\par a general mirror of the universal will: the conspicuous event which
\par is refracted in this mirror expands at once for our consciousness to
\par the copy of an eternal truth. Conversely, such a conspicious event is
\par at once divested of every mythical character by the tone-painting
\par of the New Dithyramb; music has here become a wretched copy of the
\par phenomenon, and therefore infinitely poorer than the phenomenon itself:
\par through which poverty it still further reduces even the phenomenon for
\par our consciousness, so that now, for instance, a musically imitated
\par battle of this sort exhausts itself in marches, signal-sounds, etc.,
\par and our imagination is arrested precisely by these superficialities.
\par Tone-painting is therefore in every respect the counterpart of true
\par music with its mythopoeic power: through it the phenomenon, poor in
\par itself, is made still poorer, while through an isolated Dionysian music
\par the phenomenon is evolved and expanded into a picture of the world.
\par It was an immense triumph of the non-Dionysian spirit, when, in the
\par development of the New Dithyramb, it had estranged music from itself
\par and reduced it to be the slave of phenomena. Euripides, who, albeit in
\par a higher sense, must be designated as a thoroughly unmusical nature,
\par is for this very reason a passionate adherent of the New Dithyrambic
\par Music, and with the liberality of a freebooter employs all its
\par effective turns and mannerisms.
\par 
\par In another direction also we see at work the power of this
\par un-Dionysian, myth-opposing spirit, when we turn our eyes to the
\par prevalence of _character representation_ and psychological refinement
\par from Sophocles onwards. The character must no longer be expanded into
\par an eternal type, but, on the contrary, must operate individually
\par through artistic by-traits and shadings, through the nicest precision
\par of all lines, in such a manner that the spectator is in general no
\par longer conscious of the myth, but of the mighty nature-myth and the
\par imitative power of the artist. Here also we observe the victory of
\par the phenomenon over the Universal, and the delight in the particular
\par quasi-anatomical preparation; we actually breathe the air of a
\par theoretical world, in which scientific knowledge is valued more highly
\par than the artistic reflection of a universal law. The movement along
\par the line of the representation of character proceeds rapidly: while
\par Sophocles still delineates complete characters and employs myth for
\par their refined development, Euripides already delineates only prominent
\par individual traits of character, which can express themselves in violent
\par bursts of passion; in the New Attic Comedy, however, there are only
\par masks with _one_ expression: frivolous old men, duped panders, and
\par cunning slaves in untiring repetition. Where now is the mythopoeic
\par spirit of music? What is still left now of music is either excitatory
\par music or souvenir music, that is, either a stimulant for dull and
\par used-up nerves, or tone-painting. As regards the former, it hardly
\par matters about the text set to it: the heroes and choruses of Euripides
\par are already dissolute enough when once they begin to sing; to what pass
\par must things have come with his brazen successors?
\par 
\par The new un-Dionysian spirit, however, manifests itself most clearly in
\par the _d\'e9nouements_ of the new dramas. In the Old Tragedy one could feel
\par at the close the metaphysical comfort, without which the delight in
\par tragedy cannot be explained at all; the conciliating tones from another
\par world sound purest, perhaps, in the \'8cdipus at Colonus. Now that the
\par genius of music has fled from tragedy, tragedy is, strictly speaking,
\par dead: for from whence could one now draw the metaphysical comfort? One
\par sought, therefore, for an earthly unravelment of the tragic dissonance;
\par the hero, after he had been sufficiently tortured by fate, reaped a
\par well-deserved reward through a superb marriage or divine tokens of
\par favour. The hero had turned gladiator, on whom, after being liberally
\par battered about and covered with wounds, freedom was occasionally
\par bestowed. The _deus ex machina_ took the place of metaphysical comfort.
\par I will not say that the tragic view of things was everywhere completely
\par destroyed by the intruding spirit of the un-Dionysian: we only know
\par that it was compelled to flee from art into the under-world as it were,
\par in the degenerate form of a secret cult. Over the widest extent of the
\par Hellenic character, however, there raged the consuming blast of this
\par spirit, which manifests itself in the form of "Greek cheerfulness,"
\par which we have already spoken of as a senile, unproductive love of
\par existence; this cheerfulness is the counterpart of the splendid
\par "na\'efvet\'e9" of the earlier Greeks, which, according to the characteristic
\par indicated above, must be conceived as the blossom of the Apollonian
\par culture growing out of a dark abyss, as the victory which the Hellenic
\par will, through its mirroring of beauty, obtains over suffering and the
\par wisdom of suffering. The noblest manifestation of that other form of
\par "Greek cheerfulness," the Alexandrine, is the cheerfulness of the
\par _theoretical man_: it exhibits the same symptomatic characteristics as
\par I have just inferred concerning the spirit of the un-Dionysian:--it
\par combats Dionysian wisdom and art, it seeks to dissolve myth, it
\par substitutes for metaphysical comfort an earthly consonance, in fact, a
\par _deus ex machina_ of its own, namely the god of machines and crucibles,
\par that is, the powers of the genii of nature recognised and employed in
\par the service of higher egoism; it believes in amending the world by
\par knowledge, in guiding life by science, and that it can really confine
\par the individual within a narrow sphere of solvable problems, where he
\par cheerfully says to life: "I desire thee: it is worth while to know
\par thee."
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 18.
\par 
\par 
\par It is an eternal phenomenon: the avidious will can always, by means
\par of an illusion spread over things, detain its creatures in life
\par and compel them to live on. One is chained by the Socratic love of
\par knowledge and the vain hope of being able thereby to heal the eternal
\par wound of existence; another is ensnared by art's seductive veil of
\par beauty fluttering before his eyes; still another by the metaphysical
\par comfort that eternal life flows on indestructibly beneath the whirl of
\par phenomena: to say nothing of the more ordinary and almost more powerful
\par illusions which the will has always at hand. These three specimens of
\par illusion are on the whole designed only for the more nobly endowed
\par natures, who in general feel profoundly the weight and burden of
\par existence, and must be deluded into forgetfulness of their displeasure
\par by exquisite stimulants. All that we call culture is made up of these
\par stimulants; and, according to the proportion of the ingredients, we
\par have either a specially _Socratic_ or _artistic_ or _tragic culture_:
\par or, if historical exemplifications are wanted, there is either an
\par Alexandrine or a Hellenic or a Buddhistic culture.
\par 
\par Our whole modern world is entangled in the meshes of Alexandrine
\par culture, and recognises as its ideal the _theorist_ equipped with
\par the most potent means of knowledge, and labouring in the service of
\par science, of whom the archetype and progenitor is Socrates. All our
\par educational methods have originally this ideal in view: every other
\par form of existence must struggle onwards wearisomely beside it, as
\par something tolerated, but not intended. In an almost alarming manner the
\par cultured man was here found for a long time only in the form of the
\par scholar: even our poetical arts have been forced to evolve from learned
\par imitations, and in the main effect of the rhyme we still recognise the
\par origin of our poetic form from artistic experiments with a non-native
\par and thoroughly learned language. How unintelligible must _Faust,_ the
\par modern cultured man, who is in himself intelligible, have appeared to a
\par true Greek,--Faust, storming discontentedly through all the faculties,
\par devoted to magic and the devil from a desire for knowledge, whom we
\par have only to place alongside of Socrates for the purpose of comparison,
\par in order to see that modern man begins to divine the boundaries of
\par this Socratic love of perception and longs for a coast in the wide
\par waste of the ocean of knowledge. When Goethe on one occasion said to
\par Eckermann with reference to Napoleon: "Yes, my good friend, there is
\par also a productiveness of deeds," he reminded us in a charmingly na\'efve
\par manner that the non-theorist is something incredible and astounding to
\par modern man; so that the wisdom of Goethe is needed once more in order
\par to discover that such a surprising form of existence is comprehensible,
\par nay even pardonable.
\par 
\par Now, we must not hide from ourselves what is concealed in the heart
\par of this Socratic culture: Optimism, deeming itself absolute! Well, we
\par must not be alarmed if the fruits of this optimism ripen,--if society,
\par leavened to the very lowest strata by this kind of culture, gradually
\par begins to tremble through wanton agitations and desires, if the belief
\par in the earthly happiness of all, if the belief in the possibility of
\par such a general intellectual culture is gradually transformed into the
\par threatening demand for such an Alexandrine earthly happiness, into
\par the conjuring of a Euripidean _deus ex machina._ Let us mark this
\par well: the Alexandrine culture requires a slave class, to be able to
\par exist permanently: but, in its optimistic view of life, it denies the
\par necessity of such a class, and consequently, when the effect of its
\par beautifully seductive and tranquillising utterances about the "dignity
\par of man" and the "dignity of labour" is spent, it gradually drifts
\par towards a dreadful destination. There is nothing more terrible than
\par a barbaric slave class, who have learned to regard their existence
\par as an injustice, and now prepare to take vengeance, not only for
\par themselves, but for all generations. In the face of such threatening
\par storms, who dares to appeal with confident spirit to our pale and
\par exhausted religions, which even in their foundations have degenerated
\par into scholastic religions?--so that myth, the necessary prerequisite
\par of every religion, is already paralysed everywhere, and even in this
\par domain the optimistic spirit--which we have just designated as the
\par annihilating germ of society--has attained the mastery.
\par 
\par While the evil slumbering in the heart of theoretical culture gradually
\par begins to disquiet modern man, and makes him anxiously ransack the
\par stores of his experience for means to avert the danger, though not
\par believing very much in these means; while he, therefore, begins to
\par divine the consequences his position involves: great, universally
\par gifted natures have contrived, with an incredible amount of thought, to
\par make use of the apparatus of science itself, in order to point out the
\par limits and the relativity of knowledge generally, and thus definitely
\par to deny the claim of science to universal validity and universal ends:
\par with which demonstration the illusory notion was for the first time
\par recognised as such, which pretends, with the aid of causality, to be
\par able to fathom the innermost essence of things. The extraordinary
\par courage and wisdom of _Kant_ and _Schopenhauer_ have succeeded in
\par gaining the most, difficult, victory, the victory over the optimism
\par hidden in the essence of logic, which optimism in turn is the basis of
\par our culture. While this optimism, resting on apparently unobjectionable
\par _\'e6terna veritates,_ believed in the intelligibility and solvability of
\par all the riddles of the world, and treated space, time, and causality
\par as totally unconditioned laws of the most universal validity, Kant, on
\par the other hand, showed that these served in reality only to elevate the
\par mere phenomenon, the work of M\'e2y\'e2, to the sole and highest reality,
\par putting it in place of the innermost and true essence of things, thus
\par making the actual knowledge of this essence impossible, that is,
\par according to the expression of Schopenhauer, to lull the dreamer still
\par more soundly asleep (_Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,_ I. 498). With
\par this knowledge a culture is inaugurated which I venture to designate as
\par a tragic culture; the most important characteristic of which is that
\par wisdom takes the place of science as the highest end,--wisdom, which,
\par uninfluenced by the seductive distractions of the sciences, turns
\par with unmoved eye to the comprehensive view of the world, and seeks to
\par apprehend therein the eternal suffering as its own with sympathetic
\par feelings of love. Let us imagine a rising generation with this
\par undauntedness of vision, with this heroic desire for the prodigious,
\par let us imagine the bold step of these dragon-slayers, the proud and
\par daring spirit with which they turn their backs on all the effeminate
\par doctrines of optimism in order "to live resolutely" in the Whole and in
\par the Full: would it not be necessary for the tragic man of this culture,
\par with his self-discipline to earnestness and terror, to desire a new
\par art, the art of metaphysical comfort,--namely, tragedy, as the Hellena
\par belonging to him, and that he should exclaim with Faust:
\par 
\par     Und sollt' ich nicht, sehns\'fcchtigster Gewalt,
\par     In's Leben ziehn die einzigste Gestalt?[21]
\par 
\par But now that the Socratic culture has been shaken from two directions,
\par and is only able to hold the sceptre of its infallibility with
\par trembling hands,--once by the fear of its own conclusions which it at
\par length begins to surmise, and again, because it is no longer convinced
\par with its former na\'efve trust of the eternal validity of its foundation,
\par --it is a sad spectacle to behold how the dance of its thought always
\par rushes longingly on new forms, to embrace them, and then, shuddering,
\par lets them go of a sudden, as Mephistopheles does the seductive Lami\'e6.
\par It is certainly the symptom of the "breach" which all are wont to speak
\par of as the primordial suffering of modern culture that the theoretical
\par man, alarmed and dissatisfied at his own conclusions, no longer dares
\par to entrust himself to the terrible ice-stream of existence: he runs
\par timidly up and down the bank. He no longer wants to have anything
\par entire, with all the natural cruelty of things, so thoroughly has he
\par been spoiled by his optimistic contemplation. Besides, he feels that
\par a culture built up on the principles of science must perish when it
\par begins to grow _illogical,_ that is, to avoid its own conclusions.
\par Our art reveals this universal trouble: in vain does one seek help by
\par imitating all the great productive periods and natures, in vain does
\par one accumulate the entire "world-literature" around modern man for
\par his comfort, in vain does one place one's self in the midst of the
\par art-styles and artists of all ages, so that one may give names to them
\par as Adam did to the beasts: one still continues the eternal hungerer,
\par the "critic" without joy and energy, the Alexandrine man, who is in
\par the main a librarian and corrector of proofs, and who, pitiable wretch
\par goes blind from the dust of books and printers' errors.

\par 
\par We cannot designate the intrinsic substance of Socratic culture more
\par distinctly than by calling it _the culture of the opera_: for it is in
\par this department that culture has expressed itself with special na\'efvet\'e9
\par concerning its aims and perceptions, which is sufficiently surprising
\par when we compare the genesis of the opera and the facts of operatic
\par development with the eternal truths of the Apollonian and Dionysian.
\par I call to mind first of all the origin of the _stilo rappresentativo_
\par and the recitative. Is it credible that this thoroughly externalised
\par operatic music, incapable of devotion, could be received and cherished
\par with enthusiastic favour, as a re-birth, as it were, of all true music,
\par by the very age in which the ineffably sublime and sacred music of
\par Palestrina had originated? And who, on the other hand, would think of
\par making only the diversion-craving luxuriousness of those Florentine
\par circles and the vanity of their dramatic singers responsible for the
\par love of the opera which spread with such rapidity? That in the same
\par age, even among the same people, this passion for a half-musical
\par mode of speech should awaken alongside of the vaulted structure
\par of Palestrine harmonies which the entire Christian Middle Age had
\par been building up, I can explain to myself only by a co-operating
\par _extra-artistic tendency_ in the essence of the recitative.
\par 
\par The listener, who insists on distinctly hearing the words under the
\par music, has his wishes met by the singer in that he speaks rather than
\par sings, and intensifies the pathetic expression of the words in this
\par half-song: by this intensification of the pathos he facilitates the
\par understanding of the words and surmounts the remaining half of the
\par music. The specific danger which now threatens him is that in some
\par unguarded moment he may give undue importance to music, which would
\par forthwith result in the destruction of the pathos of the speech and
\par the distinctness of the words: while, on the other hand, he always
\par feels himself impelled to musical delivery and to virtuose exhibition
\par of vocal talent. Here the "poet" comes to his aid, who knows how to
\par provide him with abundant opportunities for lyrical interjections,
\par repetitions of words and sentences, etc.,--at which places the singer,
\par now in the purely musical element, can rest himself without minding the
\par words. This alternation of emotionally impressive, yet only half-sung
\par speech and wholly sung interjections, which is characteristic of the
\par _stilo rappresentativo,_ this rapidly changing endeavour to operate
\par now on the conceptional and representative faculty of the hearer, now
\par on his musical sense, is something so thoroughly unnatural and withal
\par so intrinsically contradictory both to the Apollonian and Dionysian
\par artistic impulses, that one has to infer an origin of the recitative
\par foreign to all artistic instincts. The recitative must be defined,
\par according to this description, as the combination of epic and lyric
\par delivery, not indeed as an intrinsically stable combination which
\par could not be attained in the case of such totally disparate elements,
\par but an entirely superficial mosaic conglutination, such as is totally
\par unprecedented in the domain of nature and experience. _But this was
\par not the opinion of the inventors of the recitative:_ they themselves,
\par and their age with them, believed rather that the mystery of antique
\par music had been solved by this _stilo rappresentativo,_ in which, as
\par they thought, the only explanation of the enormous influence of an
\par Orpheus, an Amphion, and even of Greek tragedy was to be found. The new
\par style was regarded by them as the re-awakening of the most effective
\par music, the Old Greek music: indeed, with the universal and popular
\par conception of the Homeric world _as the primitive world,_ they could
\par abandon themselves to the dream of having descended once more into the
\par paradisiac beginnings of mankind, wherein music also must needs have
\par had the unsurpassed purity, power, and innocence of which the poets
\par could give such touching accounts in their pastoral plays. Here we see
\par into the internal process of development of this thoroughly modern
\par variety of art, the opera: a powerful need here acquires an art, but
\par it is a need of an un\'e6sthetic kind: the yearning for the idyll, the
\par belief in the prehistoric existence of the artistic, good man. The
\par recitative was regarded as the rediscovered language of this primitive
\par man; the opera as the recovered land of this idyllically or heroically
\par good creature, who in every action follows at the same time a natural
\par artistic impulse, who sings a little along with all he has to say, in
\par order to sing immediately with full voice on the slightest emotional
\par excitement. It is now a matter of indifference to us that the humanists
\par of those days combated the old ecclesiastical representation of man
\par as naturally corrupt and lost, with this new-created picture of the
\par paradisiac artist: so that opera may be understood as the oppositional
\par dogma of the good man, whereby however a solace was at the same time
\par found for the pessimism to which precisely the seriously-disposed
\par men of that time were most strongly incited, owing to the frightful
\par uncertainty of all conditions of life. It is enough to have perceived
\par that the intrinsic charm, and therefore the genesis, of this new form
\par of art lies in the gratification of an altogether un\'e6sthetic need, in
\par the optimistic glorification of man as such, in the conception of the
\par primitive man as the man naturally good and artistic: a principle of
\par the opera which has gradually changed into a threatening and terrible
\par _demand,_ which, in face of the socialistic movements of the present
\par time, we can no longer ignore. The "good primitive man" wants his
\par rights: what paradisiac prospects!
\par 
\par I here place by way of parallel still another equally obvious
\par confirmation of my view that opera is built up on the same principles
\par as our Alexandrine culture. Opera is the birth of the theoretical man,
\par of the critical layman, not of the artist: one of the most surprising
\par facts in the whole history of art. It was the demand of thoroughly
\par unmusical hearers that the words must above all be understood, so
\par that according to them a re-birth of music is only to be expected
\par when some mode of singing has been discovered in which the text-word
\par lords over the counterpoint as the master over the servant. For the
\par words, it is argued, are as much nobler than the accompanying harmonic
\par system as the soul is nobler than the body. It was in accordance with
\par the laically unmusical crudeness of these views that the combination
\par of music, picture and expression was effected in the beginnings of
\par the opera: in the spirit of this \'e6sthetics the first experiments
\par were also made in the leading laic circles of Florence by the poets
\par and singers patronised there. The man incapable of art creates for
\par himself a species of art precisely because he is the inartistic man
\par as such. Because he does not divine the Dionysian depth of music, he
\par changes his musical taste into appreciation of the understandable
\par word-and-tone-rhetoric of the passions in the _stilo rappresentativo,_
\par and into the voluptuousness of the arts of song; because he is unable
\par to behold a vision, he forces the machinist and the decorative artist
\par into his service; because he cannot apprehend the true nature of the
\par artist, he conjures up the "artistic primitive man" to suit his taste,
\par that is, the man who sings and recites verses under the influence
\par of passion. He dreams himself into a time when passion suffices to
\par generate songs and poems: as if emotion had ever been able to create
\par anything artistic. The postulate of the opera is a false belief
\par concerning the artistic process, in fact, the idyllic belief that every
\par sentient man is an artist. In the sense of this belief, opera is the
\par expression of the taste of the laity in art, who dictate their laws
\par with the cheerful optimism of the theorist.
\par 
\par Should we desire to unite in one the two conceptions just set forth
\par as influential in the origin of opera, it would only remain for us to
\par speak of an _idyllic tendency of the opera_: in which connection we
\par may avail ourselves exclusively of the phraseology and illustration of
\par Schiller.[22] "Nature and the ideal," he says, "are either objects of
\par grief, when the former is represented as lost, the latter unattained;
\par or both are objects of joy, in that they are represented as real.
\par The first case furnishes the elegy in its narrower signification,
\par the second the idyll in its widest sense." Here we must at once call
\par attention to the common characteristic of these two conceptions in
\par operatic genesis, namely, that in them the ideal is not regarded as
\par unattained or nature as lost Agreeably to this sentiment, there was
\par a primitive age of man when he lay close to the heart of nature,
\par and, owing to this naturalness, had attained the ideal of mankind in
\par a paradisiac goodness and artist-organisation: from which perfect
\par primitive man all of us were supposed to be descended; whose faithful
\par copy we were in fact still said to be: only we had to cast off some
\par few things in order to recognise ourselves once more as this primitive
\par man, on the strength of a voluntary renunciation of superfluous
\par learnedness, of super-abundant culture. It was to such a concord of
\par nature and the ideal, to an idyllic reality, that the cultured man
\par of the Renaissance suffered himself to be led back by his operatic
\par imitation of Greek tragedy; he made use of this tragedy, as Dante made
\par use of Vergil, in order to be led up to the gates of paradise: while
\par from this point he went on without assistance and passed over from an
\par imitation of the highest form of Greek art to a "restoration of all
\par things," to an imitation of man's original art-world. What delightfully
\par na\'efve hopefulness of these daring endeavours, in the very heart of
\par theoretical culture!--solely to be explained by the comforting belief,
\par that "man-in-himself" is the eternally virtuous hero of the opera,
\par the eternally fluting or singing shepherd, who must always in the end
\par rediscover himself as such, if he has at any time really lost himself;
\par solely the fruit of the optimism, which here rises like a sweetishly
\par seductive column of vapour out of the depth of the Socratic conception
\par of the world.
\par 
\par The features of the opera therefore do not by any means exhibit the
\par elegiac sorrow of an eternal loss, but rather the cheerfulness of
\par eternal rediscovery, the indolent delight in an idyllic reality which
\par one can at least represent to one's self each moment as real: and in
\par so doing one will perhaps surmise some day that this supposed reality
\par is nothing but a fantastically silly dawdling, concerning which every
\par one, who could judge it by the terrible earnestness of true nature
\par and compare it with the actual primitive scenes of the beginnings of
\par mankind, would have to call out with loathing: Away with the phantom!
\par Nevertheless one would err if one thought it possible to frighten
\par away merely by a vigorous shout such a dawdling thing as the opera,
\par as if it were a spectre. He who would destroy the opera must join
\par issue with Alexandrine cheerfulness, which expresses itself so na\'efvely
\par therein concerning its favourite representation; of which in fact
\par it is the specific form of art. But what is to be expected for art
\par itself from the operation of a form of art, the beginnings of which
\par do not at all lie in the \'e6sthetic province; which has rather stolen
\par over from a half-moral sphere into the artistic domain, and has been
\par able only now and then to delude us concerning this hybrid origin? By
\par what sap is this parasitic opera-concern nourished, if not by that
\par of true art? Must we not suppose that the highest and indeed the
\par truly serious task of art--to free the eye from its glance into the
\par horrors of night and to deliver the "subject" by the healing balm of
\par appearance from the spasms of volitional agitations--will degenerate
\par under the influence of its idyllic seductions and Alexandrine
\par adulation to an empty dissipating tendency, to pastime? What will
\par become of the eternal truths of the Dionysian and Apollonian in such
\par an amalgamation of styles as I have exhibited in the character of the
\par _stilo rappresentativo_? where music is regarded as the servant, the
\par text as the master, where music is compared with the body, the text
\par with the soul? where at best the highest aim will be the realisation
\par of a paraphrastic tone-painting, just as formerly in the New Attic
\par Dithyramb? where music is completely alienated from its true dignity
\par of being, the Dionysian mirror of the world, so that the only thing
\par left to it is, as a slave of phenomena, to imitate the formal character
\par thereof, and to excite an external pleasure in the play of lines and
\par proportions. On close observation, this fatal influence of the opera
\par on music is seen to coincide absolutely with the universal development
\par of modern music; the optimism lurking in the genesis of the opera and
\par in the essence of culture represented thereby, has, with alarming
\par rapidity, succeeded in divesting music of its Dionyso-cosmic mission
\par and in impressing on it a playfully formal and pleasurable character: a
\par change with which perhaps only the metamorphosis of the \'c6schylean man
\par into the cheerful Alexandrine man could be compared.
\par 
\par If, however, in the exemplification herewith indicated we have rightly
\par associated the evanescence of the Dionysian spirit with a most
\par striking, but hitherto unexplained transformation and degeneration of
\par the Hellene--what hopes must revive in us when the most trustworthy
\par auspices guarantee _the reverse process, the gradual awakening of
\par the Dionysian spirit_ in our modern world! It is impossible for the
\par divine strength of Herakles to languish for ever in voluptuous bondage
\par to Omphale. Out of the Dionysian root of the German spirit a power
\par has arisen which has nothing in common with the primitive conditions
\par of Socratic culture, and can neither be explained nor excused
\par thereby, but is rather regarded by this culture as something terribly
\par inexplicable and overwhelmingly hostile,--namely, _German music_ as
\par we have to understand it, especially in its vast solar orbit from
\par Bach to Beethoven, from Beethoven to Wagner. What even under the most
\par favourable circumstances can the knowledge-craving Socratism of our
\par days do with this demon rising from unfathomable depths? Neither by
\par means of the zig-zag and arabesque work of operatic melody, nor with
\par the aid of the arithmetical counting board of fugue and contrapuntal
\par dialectics is the formula to be found, in the trebly powerful light[23]
\par of which one could subdue this demon and compel it to speak. What
\par a spectacle, when our \'e6sthetes, with a net of "beauty" peculiar to
\par themselves, now pursue and clutch at the genius of music romping
\par about before them with incomprehensible life, and in so doing display
\par activities which are not to be judged by the standard of eternal beauty
\par any more than by the standard of the sublime. Let us but observe these
\par patrons of music as they are, at close range, when they call out so
\par indefatigably "beauty! beauty!" to discover whether they have the marks
\par of nature's darling children who are fostered and fondled in the lap
\par of the beautiful, or whether they do not rather seek a disguise for
\par their own rudeness, an \'e6sthetical pretext for their own unemotional
\par insipidity: I am thinking here, for instance, of Otto Jahn. But let the
\par liar and the hypocrite beware of our German music: for in the midst
\par of all our culture it is really the only genuine, pure and purifying
\par fire-spirit from which and towards which, as in the teaching of the
\par great Heraclitus of Ephesus, all things move in a double orbit-all
\par that we now call culture, education, civilisation, must appear some day
\par before the unerring judge, Dionysus.
\par 
\par Let us recollect furthermore how Kant and Schopenhauer made it
\par possible for the spirit of _German philosophy_ streaming from the
\par same sources to annihilate the satisfied delight in existence of
\par scientific Socratism by the delimitation of the boundaries thereof; how
\par through this delimitation an infinitely profounder and more serious
\par view of ethical problems and of art was inaugurated, which we may
\par unhesitatingly designate as _Dionysian_ wisdom comprised in concepts.
\par To what then does the mystery of this oneness of German music and
\par philosophy point, if not to a new form of existence, concerning the
\par substance of which we can only inform ourselves presentiently from
\par Hellenic analogies? For to us who stand on the boundary line between
\par two different forms of existence, the Hellenic prototype retains the
\par immeasurable value, that therein all these transitions and struggles
\par are imprinted in a classically instructive form: except that we, as
\par it were, experience analogically in _reverse_ order the chief epochs
\par of the Hellenic genius, and seem now, for instance, to pass backwards
\par from the Alexandrine age to the period of tragedy. At the same time
\par we have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age betokens only a
\par return to itself of the German spirit, a blessed self-rediscovering
\par after excessive and urgent external influences have for a long time
\par compelled it, living as it did in helpless barbaric formlessness, to
\par servitude under their form. It may at last, after returning to the
\par primitive source of its being, venture to stalk along boldly and freely
\par before all nations without hugging the leading-strings of a Romanic
\par civilisation: if only it can learn implicitly of one people--the
\par Greeks, of whom to learn at all is itself a high honour and a rare
\par distinction. And when did we require these highest of all teachers more
\par than at present, when we experience _a re-birth of tragedy_ and are in
\par danger alike of not knowing whence it comes, and of being unable to
\par make clear to ourselves whither it tends.

\par 
\par 
\par It may be weighed some day before an impartial judge, in what time and
\par in what men the German spirit has thus far striven most resolutely to
\par learn of the Greeks: and if we confidently assume that this unique
\par praise must be accorded to the noblest intellectual efforts of Goethe,
\par Schiller, and Winkelmann, it will certainly have to be added that
\par since their time, and subsequently to the more immediate influences of
\par these efforts, the endeavour to attain to culture and to the Greeks by
\par this path has in an incomprehensible manner grown feebler and feebler.
\par In order not to despair altogether of the German spirit, must we not
\par infer therefrom that possibly, in some essential matter, even these
\par champions could not penetrate into the core of the Hellenic nature,
\par and were unable to establish a permanent friendly alliance between
\par German and Greek culture? So that perhaps an unconscious perception
\par of this shortcoming might raise also in more serious minds the
\par disheartening doubt as to whether after such predecessors they could
\par advance still farther on this path of culture, or could reach the goal
\par at all. Accordingly, we see the opinions concerning the value of Greek
\par contribution to culture degenerate since that time in the most alarming
\par manner; the expression of compassionate superiority may be heard
\par in the most heterogeneous intellectual and non-intellectual camps,
\par and elsewhere a totally ineffective declamation dallies with "Greek
\par harmony," "Greek beauty," "Greek cheerfulness." And in the very circles
\par whose dignity it might be to draw indefatigably from the Greek channel
\par for the good of German culture, in the circles of the teachers in the
\par higher educational institutions, they have learned best to compromise
\par with the Greeks in good time and on easy terms, to the extent often of
\par a sceptical abandonment of the Hellenic ideal and a total perversion of
\par the true purpose of antiquarian studies. If there be any one at all in
\par these circles who has not completely exhausted himself in the endeavour
\par to be a trustworthy corrector of old texts or a natural-history
\par microscopist of language, he perhaps seeks also to appropriate Grecian
\par antiquity "historically" along with other antiquities, and in any case
\par according to the method and with the supercilious air of our present
\par cultured historiography. When, therefore, the intrinsic efficiency
\par of the higher educational institutions has never perhaps been lower
\par or feebler than at present, when the "journalist," the paper slave
\par of the day, has triumphed over the academic teacher in all matters
\par pertaining to culture, and there only remains to the latter the often
\par previously experienced metamorphosis of now fluttering also, as a
\par cheerful cultured butterfly, in the idiom of the journalist, with the
\par "light elegance" peculiar thereto--with what painful confusion must the
\par cultured persons of a period like the present gaze at the phenomenon
\par (which can perhaps be comprehended analogically only by means of the
\par profoundest principle of the hitherto unintelligible Hellenic genius)
\par of the reawakening of the Dionysian spirit and the re-birth of tragedy?
\par Never has there been another art-period in which so-called culture
\par and true art have been so estranged and opposed, as is so obviously
\par the case at present. We understand why so feeble a culture hates true
\par art; it fears destruction thereby. But must not an entire domain of
\par culture, namely the Socratic-Alexandrine, have exhausted its powers
\par after contriving to culminate in such a daintily-tapering point as our
\par present culture? When it was not permitted to heroes like Goethe and
\par Schiller to break open the enchanted gate which leads into the Hellenic
\par magic mountain, when with their most dauntless striving they did not
\par get beyond the longing gaze which the Goethean Iphigenia cast from
\par barbaric Tauris to her home across the ocean, what could the epigones
\par of such heroes hope for, if the gate should not open to them suddenly
\par of its own accord, in an entirely different position, quite overlooked
\par in all endeavours of culture hitherto--amidst the mystic tones of
\par reawakened tragic music.
\par 
\par Let no one attempt to weaken our faith in an impending re-birth of
\par Hellenic antiquity; for in it alone we find our hope of a renovation
\par and purification of the German spirit through the fire-magic of music.
\par What else do we know of amidst the present desolation and languor
\par of culture, which could awaken any comforting expectation for the
\par future? We look in vain for one single vigorously-branching root, for
\par a speck of fertile and healthy soil: there is dust, sand, torpidness
\par and languishing everywhere! Under such circumstances a cheerless
\par solitary wanderer could choose for himself no better symbol than the
\par Knight with Death and the Devil, as D\'fcrer has sketched him for us, the
\par mail-clad knight, grim and stern of visage, who is able, unperturbed
\par by his gruesome companions, and yet hopelessly, to pursue his terrible
\par path with horse and hound alone. Our Schopenhauer was such a D\'fcrerian
\par knight: he was destitute of all hope, but he sought the truth. There is
\par not his equal.
\par 
\par But how suddenly this gloomily depicted wilderness of our exhausted
\par culture changes when the Dionysian magic touches it! A hurricane
\par seizes everything decrepit, decaying, collapsed, and stunted; wraps
\par it whirlingly into a red cloud of dust; and carries it like a vulture
\par into the air. Confused thereby, our glances seek for what has vanished:
\par for what they see is something risen to the golden light as from
\par a depression, so full and green, so luxuriantly alive, so ardently
\par infinite. Tragedy sits in the midst of this exuberance of life,
\par sorrow and joy, in sublime ecstasy; she listens to a distant doleful
\par song--it tells of the Mothers of Being, whose names are: _Wahn, Wille,
\par Wehe_[21]--Yes, my friends, believe with me in Dionysian life and
\par in the re-birth of tragedy. The time of the Socratic man is past:
\par crown yourselves with ivy, take in your hands the thyrsus, and do not
\par marvel if tigers and panthers lie down fawning at your feet. Dare now
\par to be tragic men, for ye are to be redeemed! Ye are to accompany the
\par Dionysian festive procession from India to Greece! Equip yourselves for
\par severe conflict, but believe in the wonders of your god!
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 21.
\par 
\par 
\par Gliding back from these hortative tones into the mood which befits
\par the contemplative man, I repeat that it can only be learnt from the
\par Greeks what such a sudden and miraculous awakening of tragedy must
\par signify for the essential basis of a people's life. It is the people
\par of the tragic mysteries who fight the battles with the Persians: and
\par again, the people who waged such wars required tragedy as a necessary
\par healing potion. Who would have imagined that there was still such a
\par uniformly powerful effusion of the simplest political sentiments, the
\par most natural domestic instincts and the primitive manly delight in
\par strife in this very people after it had been shaken to its foundations
\par for several generations by the most violent convulsions of the
\par Dionysian demon? If at every considerable spreading of the Dionysian
\par commotion one always perceives that the Dionysian loosing from the
\par shackles of the individual makes itself felt first of all in an
\par increased encroachment on the political instincts, to the extent of
\par indifference, yea even hostility, it is certain, on the other hand,
\par that the state-forming Apollo is also the genius of the _principium
\par individuationis,_ and that the state and domestic sentiment cannot live
\par without an assertion of individual personality. There is only one way
\par from orgasm for a people,--the way to Indian Buddhism, which, in order
\par to be at all endured with its longing for nothingness, requires the
\par rare ecstatic states with their elevation above space, time, and the
\par individual; just as these in turn demand a philosophy which teaches how
\par to overcome the indescribable depression of the intermediate states by
\par means of a fancy. With the same necessity, owing to the unconditional
\par dominance of political impulses, a people drifts into a path of
\par extremest secularisation, the most magnificent, but also the most
\par terrible expression of which is the Roman _imperium_.
\par 
\par Placed between India and Rome, and constrained to a seductive choice,
\par the Greeks succeeded in devising in classical purity still a third form
\par of life, not indeed for long private use, but just on that account for
\par immortality. For it holds true in all things that those whom the gods
\par love die young, but, on the other hand, it holds equally true that they
\par then live eternally with the gods. One must not demand of what is most
\par noble that it should possess the durable toughness of leather; the
\par staunch durability, which, for instance, was inherent in the national
\par character of the Romans, does not probably belong to the indispensable
\par predicates of perfection. But if we ask by what physic it was possible
\par for the Greeks, in their best period, notwithstanding the extraordinary
\par strength of their Dionysian and political impulses, neither to exhaust
\par themselves by ecstatic brooding, nor by a consuming scramble for empire
\par and worldly honour, but to attain the splendid mixture which we find
\par in a noble, inflaming, and contemplatively disposing wine, we must
\par remember the enormous power of _tragedy,_ exciting, purifying, and
\par disburdening the entire life of a people; the highest value of which
\par we shall divine only when, as in the case of the Greeks, it appears
\par to us as the essence of all the prophylactic healing forces, as the
\par mediator arbitrating between the strongest and most inherently fateful
\par characteristics of a people.
\par 
\par Tragedy absorbs the highest musical orgasm into itself, so that it
\par absolutely brings music to perfection among the Greeks, as among
\par ourselves; but it then places alongside thereof tragic myth and the
\par tragic hero, who, like a mighty Titan, takes the entire Dionysian world
\par on his shoulders and disburdens us thereof; while, on the other hand,
\par it is able by means of this same tragic myth, in the person of the
\par tragic hero, to deliver us from the intense longing for this existence,
\par and reminds us with warning hand of another existence and a higher
\par joy, for which the struggling hero prepares himself presentiently by
\par his destruction, not by his victories. Tragedy sets a sublime symbol,
\par namely the myth between the universal authority of its music and the
\par receptive Dionysian hearer, and produces in him the illusion that music
\par is only the most effective means for the animation of the plastic world
\par of myth. Relying upon this noble illusion, she can now move her limbs
\par for the dithyrambic dance, and abandon herself unhesitatingly to an
\par orgiastic feeling of freedom, in which she could not venture to indulge
\par as music itself, without this illusion. The myth protects us from the
\par music, while, on the other hand, it alone gives the highest freedom
\par thereto. By way of return for this service, music imparts to tragic
\par myth such an impressive and convincing metaphysical significance as
\par could never be attained by word and image, without this unique aid;
\par and the tragic spectator in particular experiences thereby the sure
\par presentiment of supreme joy to which the path through destruction and
\par negation leads; so that he thinks he hears, as it were, the innermost
\par abyss of things speaking audibly to him.
\par 
\par If in these last propositions I have succeeded in giving perhaps only a
\par preliminary expression, intelligible to few at first, to this difficult
\par representation, I must not here desist from stimulating my friends to a
\par further attempt, or cease from beseeching them to prepare themselves,
\par by a detached example of our common experience, for the perception of
\par the universal proposition. In this example I must not appeal to those
\par who make use of the pictures of the scenic processes, the words and the
\par emotions of the performers, in order to approximate thereby to musical
\par perception; for none of these speak music as their mother-tongue,
\par and, in spite of the aids in question, do not get farther than the
\par precincts of musical perception, without ever being allowed to touch
\par its innermost shrines; some of them, like Gervinus, do not even reach
\par the precincts by this path. I have only to address myself to those
\par who, being immediately allied to music, have it as it were for their
\par mother's lap, and are connected with things almost exclusively by
\par unconscious musical relations. I ask the question of these genuine
\par musicians: whether they can imagine a man capable of hearing the third
\par act of _Tristan und Isolde_ without any aid of word or scenery, purely
\par as a vast symphonic period, without expiring by a spasmodic distention
\par of all the wings of the soul? A man who has thus, so to speak, put his
\par ear to the heart-chamber of the cosmic will, who feels the furious
\par desire for existence issuing therefrom as a thundering stream or most
\par gently dispersed brook, into all the veins of the world, would he not
\par collapse all at once? Could he endure, in the wretched fragile tenement
\par of the human individual, to hear the re-echo of countless cries of
\par joy and sorrow from the "vast void of cosmic night," without flying
\par irresistibly towards his primitive home at the sound of this pastoral
\par dance-song of metaphysics? But if, nevertheless, such a work can be
\par heard as a whole, without a renunciation of individual existence, if
\par such a creation could be created without demolishing its creator--where
\par are we to get the solution of this contradiction?
\par 
\par Here there interpose between our highest musical excitement and the
\par music in question the tragic myth and the tragic hero--in reality only
\par as symbols of the most universal facts, of which music alone can speak
\par directly. If, however, we felt as purely Dionysian beings, myth as a
\par symbol would stand by us absolutely ineffective and unnoticed, and
\par would never for a moment prevent us from giving ear to the re-echo of
\par the _universalia ante rem._ Here, however, the _Apollonian_ power, with
\par a view to the restoration of the well-nigh shattered individual, bursts
\par forth with the healing balm of a blissful illusion: all of a sudden
\par we imagine we see only Tristan, motionless, with hushed voice saying
\par to himself: "the old tune, why does it wake me?" And what formerly
\par interested us like a hollow sigh from the heart of being, seems now
\par only to tell us how "waste and void is the sea." And when, breathless,
\par we thought to expire by a convulsive distention of all our feelings,
\par and only a slender tie bound us to our present existence, we now hear
\par and see only the hero wounded to death and still not dying, with his
\par despairing cry: "Longing! Longing! In dying still longing! for longing
\par not dying!" And if formerly, after such a surplus and superabundance of
\par consuming agonies, the jubilation of the born rent our hearts almost
\par like the very acme of agony, the rejoicing Kurwenal now stands between
\par us and the "jubilation as such," with face turned toward the ship which
\par carries Isolde. However powerfully fellow-suffering encroaches upon us,
\par it nevertheless delivers us in a manner from the primordial suffering
\par of the world, just as the symbol-image of the myth delivers us from the
\par immediate perception of the highest cosmic idea, just as the thought
\par and word deliver us from the unchecked effusion of the unconscious
\par will. The glorious Apollonian illusion makes it appear as if the very
\par realm of tones presented itself to us as a plastic cosmos, as if even
\par the fate of Tristan and Isolde had been merely formed and moulded
\par therein as out of some most delicate and impressible material.
\par 
\par Thus does the Apollonian wrest us from Dionysian universality and fill
\par us with rapture for individuals; to these it rivets our sympathetic
\par emotion, through these it satisfies the sense of beauty which longs for
\par great and sublime forms; it brings before us biographical portraits,
\par and incites us to a thoughtful apprehension of the essence of life
\par contained therein. With the immense potency of the image, the concept,
\par the ethical teaching and the sympathetic emotion--the Apollonian
\par influence uplifts man from his orgiastic self-annihilation, and
\par beguiles him concerning the universality of the Dionysian process
\par into the belief that he is seeing a detached picture of the world,
\par for instance, Tristan and Isolde, and that, _through music,_ he will
\par be enabled to _see_ it still more clearly and intrinsically. What can
\par the healing magic of Apollo not accomplish when it can even excite in
\par us the illusion that the Dionysian is actually in the service of the
\par Apollonian, the effects of which it is capable of enhancing; yea, that
\par music is essentially the representative art for an Apollonian substance?
\par 
\par With the pre-established harmony which obtains between perfect drama
\par and its music, the drama attains the highest degree of conspicuousness,
\par such as is usually unattainable in mere spoken drama. As all the
\par animated figures of the scene in the independently evolved lines
\par of melody simplify themselves before us to the distinctness of the
\par catenary curve, the coexistence of these lines is also audible in the
\par harmonic change which sympathises in a most delicate manner with the
\par evolved process: through which change the relations of things become
\par immediately perceptible to us in a sensible and not at all abstract
\par manner, as we likewise perceive thereby that it is only in these
\par relations that the essence of a character and of a line of melody
\par manifests itself clearly. And while music thus compels us to see more
\par extensively and more intrinsically than usual, and makes us spread out
\par the curtain of the scene before ourselves like some delicate texture,
\par the world of the stage is as infinitely expanded for our spiritualised,
\par introspective eye as it is illumined outwardly from within. How can
\par the word-poet furnish anything analogous, who strives to attain this
\par internal expansion and illumination of the visible stage-world by a
\par much more imperfect mechanism and an indirect path, proceeding as he
\par does from word and concept? Albeit musical tragedy likewise avails
\par itself of the word, it is at the same time able to place alongside
\par thereof its basis and source, and can make the unfolding of the word,
\par from within outwards, obvious to us.
\par 
\par Of the process just set forth, however, it could still be said
\par as decidedly that it is only a glorious appearance, namely the
\par afore-mentioned Apollonian _illusion,_ through the influence of which
\par we are to be delivered from the Dionysian obtrusion and excess.
\par In point of fact, the relation of music to drama is precisely the
\par reverse; music is the adequate idea of the world, drama is but the
\par reflex of this idea, a detached umbrage thereof. The identity between
\par the line of melody and the lining form, between the harmony and the
\par character-relations of this form, is true in a sense antithetical to
\par what one would suppose on the contemplation of musical tragedy. We
\par may agitate and enliven the form in the most conspicuous manner, and
\par enlighten it from within, but it still continues merely phenomenon,
\par from which there is no bridge to lead us into the true reality, into
\par the heart of the world. Music, however, speaks out of this heart; and
\par though countless phenomena of the kind might be passing manifestations
\par of this music, they could never exhaust its essence, but would always
\par be merely its externalised copies. Of course, as regards the intricate
\par relation of music and drama, nothing can be explained, while all may
\par be confused by the popular and thoroughly false antithesis of soul and
\par body; but the unphilosophical crudeness of this antithesis seems to
\par have become--who knows for what reasons--a readily accepted Article of
\par Faith with our \'e6stheticians, while they have learned nothing concerning
\par an antithesis of phenomenon and thing-in-itself, or perhaps, for
\par reasons equally unknown, have not cared to learn anything thereof.
\par 
\par Should it have been established by our analysis that the Apollonian
\par element in tragedy has by means of its illusion gained a complete
\par victory over the Dionysian primordial element of music, and has made
\par music itself subservient to its end, namely, the highest and clearest
\par elucidation of the drama, it would certainly be necessary to add the
\par very important restriction: that at the most essential point this
\par Apollonian illusion is dissolved and annihilated. The drama, which, by
\par the aid of music, spreads out before us with such inwardly illumined
\par distinctness in all its movements and figures, that we imagine we
\par see the texture unfolding on the loom as the shuttle flies to and
\par fro,--attains as a whole an effect which _transcends all Apollonian
\par artistic effects._ In the collective effect of tragedy, the Dionysian
\par gets the upper hand once more; tragedy ends with a sound which could
\par never emanate from the realm of Apollonian art. And the Apollonian
\par illusion is thereby found to be what it is,--the assiduous veiling
\par during the performance of tragedy of the intrinsically Dionysian
\par effect: which, however, is so powerful, that it finally forces
\par the Apollonian drama itself into a sphere where it begins to talk
\par with Dionysian wisdom, and even denies itself and its Apollonian
\par conspicuousness. Thus then the intricate relation of the Apollonian and
\par the Dionysian in tragedy must really be symbolised by a fraternal union
\par of the two deities: Dionysus speaks the language of Apollo; Apollo,
\par however, finally speaks the language of Dionysus; and so the highest
\par goal of tragedy and of art in general is attained.

\par 
\par Let the attentive friend picture to himself purely and simply,
\par according to his experiences, the effect of a true musical tragedy. I
\par think I have so portrayed the phenomenon of this effect in both its
\par phases that he will now be able to interpret his own experiences. For
\par he will recollect that with regard to the myth which passed before
\par him he felt himself exalted to a kind of omniscience, as if his
\par visual faculty were no longer merely a surface faculty, but capable
\par of penetrating into the interior, and as if he now saw before him,
\par with the aid of music, the ebullitions of the will, the conflict of
\par motives, and the swelling stream of the passions, almost sensibly
\par visible, like a plenitude of actively moving lines and figures, and
\par could thereby dip into the most tender secrets of unconscious emotions.
\par While he thus becomes conscious of the highest exaltation of his
\par instincts for conspicuousness and transfiguration, he nevertheless
\par feels with equal definitiveness that this long series of Apollonian
\par artistic effects still does _not_ generate the blissful continuance in
\par will-less contemplation which the plasticist and the epic poet, that
\par is to say, the strictly Apollonian artists, produce in him by their
\par artistic productions: to wit, the justification of the world of the
\par _individuatio_ attained in this contemplation,--which is the object
\par and essence of Apollonian art. He beholds the transfigured world of
\par the stage and nevertheless denies it. He sees before him the tragic
\par hero in epic clearness and beauty, and nevertheless delights in his
\par annihilation. He comprehends the incidents of the scene in all their
\par details, and yet loves to flee into the incomprehensible. He feels the
\par actions of the hero to be justified, and is nevertheless still more
\par elated when these actions annihilate their originator. He shudders at
\par the sufferings which will befall the hero, and yet anticipates therein
\par a higher and much more overpowering joy. He sees more extensively and
\par profoundly than ever, and yet wishes to be blind. Whence must we derive
\par this curious internal dissension, this collapse of the Apollonian apex,
\par if not from the _Dionysian_ spell, which, though apparently stimulating
\par the Apollonian emotions to their highest pitch, can nevertheless force
\par this superabundance of Apollonian power into its service? _Tragic
\par myth_ is to be understood only as a symbolisation of Dionysian wisdom
\par by means of the expedients of Apollonian art: the mythus conducts the
\par world of phenomena to its boundaries, where it denies itself, and seeks
\par to flee back again into the bosom of the true and only reality; where
\par it then, like Isolde, seems to strike up its metaphysical swan-song:--
\par 
\par     In des Wonnemeeres
\par     wogendem Schwall,
\par     in der Duft-Wellen
\par     t\'f6nendem Schall,
\par     in des Weltathems
\par     wehendem All--
\par     ertrinken--versinken
\par     unbewusst--h\'f6chste Lust![24]
\par 
\par We thus realise to ourselves in the experiences of the truly \'e6sthetic
\par hearer the tragic artist himself when he proceeds like a luxuriously
\par fertile divinity of individuation to create his figures (in which sense
\par his work can hardly be understood as an "imitation of nature")--and
\par when, on the other hand, his vast Dionysian impulse then absorbs the
\par entire world of phenomena, in order to anticipate beyond it, and
\par through its annihilation, the highest artistic primal joy, in the bosom
\par of the Primordial Unity. Of course, our \'e6sthetes have nothing to say
\par about this return in fraternal union of the two art-deities to the
\par original home, nor of either the Apollonian or Dionysian excitement
\par of the hearer, while they are indefatigable in characterising the
\par struggle of the hero with fate, the triumph of the moral order of the
\par world, or the disburdenment of the emotions through tragedy, as the
\par properly Tragic: an indefatigableness which makes me think that they
\par are perhaps not \'e6sthetically excitable men at all, but only to be
\par regarded as moral beings when hearing tragedy. Never since Aristotle
\par has an explanation of the tragic effect been proposed, by which an
\par \'e6sthetic activity of the hearer could be inferred from artistic
\par circumstances. At one time fear and pity are supposed to be forced to
\par an alleviating discharge through the serious procedure, at another time
\par we are expected to feel elevated and inspired at the triumph of good
\par and noble principles, at the sacrifice of the hero in the interest of
\par a moral conception of things; and however certainly I believe that for
\par countless men precisely this, and only this, is the effect of tragedy,
\par it as obviously follows therefrom that all these, together with their
\par interpreting \'e6sthetes, have had no experience of tragedy as the highest
\par _art._ The pathological discharge, the catharsis of Aristotle, which
\par philologists are at a loss whether to include under medicinal or moral
\par phenomena, recalls a remarkable anticipation of Goethe. "Without a
\par lively pathological interest," he says, "I too have never yet succeeded
\par in elaborating a tragic situation of any kind, and hence I have rather
\par avoided than sought it. Can it perhaps have been still another of the
\par merits of the ancients that the deepest pathos was with them merely
\par \'e6sthetic play, whereas with us the truth of nature must co-operate in
\par order to produce such a work?" We can now answer in the affirmative
\par this latter profound question after our glorious experiences, in which
\par we have found to our astonishment in the case of musical tragedy
\par itself, that the deepest pathos can in reality be merely \'e6sthetic play:
\par and therefore we are justified in believing that now for the first time
\par the proto-phenomenon of the tragic can be portrayed with some degree
\par of success. He who now will still persist in talking only of those
\par vicarious effects proceeding from ultra-\'e6sthetic spheres, and does not
\par feel himself raised above the pathologically-moral process, may be left
\par to despair of his \'e6sthetic nature: for which we recommend to him, by
\par way of innocent equivalent, the interpretation of Shakespeare after the
\par fashion of Gervinus, and the diligent search for poetic justice.
\par 
\par Thus with the re-birth of tragedy the _\'e6sthetic hearer_ is also
\par born anew, in whose place in the theatre a curious _quid pro quo_
\par was wont to sit with half-moral and half-learned pretensions,--the
\par "critic." In his sphere hitherto everything has been artificial and
\par merely glossed over with a semblance of life. The performing artist
\par was in fact at a loss what to do with such a critically comporting
\par hearer, and hence he, as well as the dramatist or operatic composer
\par who inspired him, searched anxiously for the last remains of life
\par in a being so pretentiously barren and incapable of enjoyment. Such
\par "critics," however, have hitherto constituted the public; the student,
\par the school-boy, yea, even the most harmless womanly creature, were
\par already unwittingly prepared by education and by journals for a similar
\par perception of works of art. The nobler natures among the artists
\par counted upon exciting the moral-religious forces in such a public,
\par and the appeal to a moral order of the world operated vicariously,
\par when in reality some powerful artistic spell should have enraptured
\par the true hearer. Or again, some imposing or at all events exciting
\par tendency of the contemporary political and social world was presented
\par by the dramatist with such vividness that the hearer could forget his
\par critical exhaustion and abandon himself to similar emotions, as, in
\par patriotic or warlike moments, before the tribune of parliament, or
\par at the condemnation of crime and vice:--an estrangement of the true
\par aims of art which could not but lead directly now and then to a cult
\par of tendency. But here there took place what has always taken place
\par in the case of factitious arts, an extraordinary rapid depravation
\par of these tendencies, so that for instance the tendency to employ the
\par theatre as a means for the moral education of the people, which in
\par Schiller's time was taken seriously, is already reckoned among the
\par incredible antiquities of a surmounted culture. While the critic got
\par the upper hand in the theatre and concert-hall, the journalist in the
\par school, and the press in society, art degenerated into a topic of
\par conversation of the most trivial kind, and \'e6sthetic criticism was used
\par as the cement of a vain, distracted, selfish and moreover piteously
\par unoriginal sociality, the significance of which is suggested by the
\par Schopenhauerian parable of the porcupines, so that there has never
\par been so much gossip about art and so little esteem for it. But is it
\par still possible to have intercourse with a man capable of conversing on
\par Beethoven or Shakespeare? Let each answer this question according to
\par his sentiments: he will at any rate show by his answer his conception
\par of "culture," provided he tries at least to answer the question, and
\par has not already grown mute with astonishment.
\par 
\par On the other hand, many a one more nobly and delicately endowed by
\par nature, though he may have gradually become a critical barbarian
\par in the manner described, could tell of the unexpected as well as
\par totally unintelligible effect which a successful performance of
\par _Lohengrin,_ for example, exerted on him: except that perhaps every
\par warning and interpreting hand was lacking to guide him; so that the
\par incomprehensibly heterogeneous and altogether incomparable sensation
\par which then affected him also remained isolated and became extinct, like
\par a mysterious star after a brief brilliancy. He then divined what the
\par \'e6sthetic hearer is.
\par 
\par 
\par [24]
\par 
\par     In the sea of pleasure's
\par     Billowing roll,
\par     In the ether-waves
\par     Knelling and toll,
\par     In the world-breath's
\par     Wavering whole--
\par     To drown in, go down in--
\par     Lost in swoon--greatest boon!
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 23.
\par 
\par 
\par He who wishes to test himself rigorously as to how he is related to the
\par true \'e6sthetic hearer, or whether he belongs rather to the community
\par of the Socrato-critical man, has only to enquire sincerely concerning
\par the sentiment with which he accepts the _wonder_ represented on the
\par stage: whether he feels his historical sense, which insists on strict
\par psychological causality, insulted by it, whether with benevolent
\par concession he as it were admits the wonder as a phenomenon intelligible
\par to childhood, but relinquished by him, or whether he experiences
\par anything else thereby. For he will thus be enabled to determine how
\par far he is on the whole capable of understanding _myth,_ that is to
\par say, the concentrated picture of the world, which, as abbreviature of
\par phenomena, cannot dispense with wonder. It is probable, however, that
\par nearly every one, upon close examination, feels so disintegrated by
\par the critico-historical spirit of our culture, that he can only perhaps
\par make the former existence of myth credible to himself by learned
\par means through intermediary abstractions. Without myth, however, every
\par culture loses its healthy, creative natural power: it is only a horizon
\par encompassed with myths which rounds off to unity a social movement.
\par It is only by myth that all the powers of the imagination and of the
\par Apollonian dream are freed from their random rovings. The mythical
\par figures have to be the invisibly omnipresent genii, under the care of
\par which the young soul grows to maturity, by the signs of which the man
\par gives a meaning to his life and struggles: and the state itself knows
\par no more powerful unwritten law than the mythical foundation which
\par vouches for its connection with religion and its growth from mythical
\par ideas.
\par 
\par Let us now place alongside thereof the abstract man proceeding
\par independently of myth, the abstract education, the abstract usage,
\par the abstract right, the abstract state: let us picture to ourselves
\par the lawless roving of the artistic imagination, not bridled by any
\par native myth: let us imagine a culture which has no fixed and sacred
\par primitive seat, but is doomed to exhaust all its possibilities, and
\par has to nourish itself wretchedly from the other cultures--such is the
\par Present, as the result of Socratism, which is bent on the destruction
\par of myth. And now the myth-less man remains eternally hungering among
\par all the bygones, and digs and grubs for roots, though he have to dig
\par for them even among the remotest antiquities. The stupendous historical
\par exigency of the unsatisfied modern culture, the gathering around one of
\par countless other cultures, the consuming desire for knowledge--what does
\par all this point to, if not to the loss of myth, the loss of the mythical
\par home, the mythical source? Let us ask ourselves whether the feverish
\par and so uncanny stirring of this culture is aught but the eager seizing
\par and snatching at food of the hungerer--and who would care to contribute
\par anything more to a culture which cannot be appeased by all it devours,
\par and in contact with which the most vigorous and wholesome nourishment
\par is wont to change into "history and criticism"?
\par 
\par We should also have to regard our German character with despair and
\par sorrow, if it had already become inextricably entangled in, or even
\par identical with this culture, in a similar manner as we can observe it
\par to our horror to be the case in civilised France; and that which for
\par a long time was the great advantage of France and the cause of her
\par vast preponderance, to wit, this very identity of people and culture,
\par might compel us at the sight thereof to congratulate ourselves that
\par this culture of ours, which is so questionable, has hitherto had
\par nothing in common with the noble kernel of the character of our people.
\par All our hopes, on the contrary, stretch out longingly towards the
\par perception that beneath this restlessly palpitating civilised life and
\par educational convulsion there is concealed a glorious, intrinsically
\par healthy, primeval power, which, to be sure, stirs vigorously only at
\par intervals in stupendous moments, and then dreams on again in view of
\par a future awakening. It is from this abyss that the German Reformation
\par came forth: in the choral-hymn of which the future melody of German
\par music first resounded. So deep, courageous, and soul-breathing, so
\par exuberantly good and tender did this chorale of Luther sound,--as the
\par first Dionysian-luring call which breaks forth from dense thickets
\par at the approach of spring. To it responded with emulative echo the
\par solemnly wanton procession of Dionysian revellers, to whom we are
\par indebted for German music--and to whom we shall be indebted for _the
\par re-birth of German myth._
\par 
\par I know that I must now lead the sympathising and attentive friend to
\par an elevated position of lonesome contemplation, where he will have
\par but few companions, and I call out encouragingly to him that we must
\par hold fast to our shining guides, the Greeks. For the rectification
\par of our \'e6sthetic knowledge we previously borrowed from them the two
\par divine figures, each of which sways a separate realm of art, and
\par concerning whose mutual contact and exaltation we have acquired a
\par notion through Greek tragedy. Through a remarkable disruption of both
\par these primitive artistic impulses, the ruin of Greek tragedy seemed
\par to be necessarily brought about: with which process a degeneration
\par and a transmutation of the Greek national character was strictly in
\par keeping, summoning us to earnest reflection as to how closely and
\par necessarily art and the people, myth and custom, tragedy and the state,
\par have coalesced in their bases. The ruin of tragedy was at the same
\par time the ruin of myth. Until then the Greeks had been involuntarily
\par compelled immediately to associate all experiences with their myths,
\par indeed they had to comprehend them only through this association:
\par whereby even the most immediate present necessarily appeared to them
\par _sub specie \'e6terni_ and in a certain sense as timeless. Into this
\par current of the timeless, however, the state as well as art plunged
\par in order to find repose from the burden and eagerness of the moment.
\par And a people--for the rest, also a man--is worth just as much only as
\par its ability to impress on its experiences the seal of eternity: for
\par it is thus, as it were, desecularised, and reveals its unconscious
\par inner conviction of the relativity of time and of the true, that is,
\par the metaphysical significance of life. The contrary happens when a
\par people begins to comprehend itself historically and to demolish the
\par mythical bulwarks around it: with which there is usually connected
\par a marked secularisation, a breach with the unconscious metaphysics
\par of its earlier existence, in all ethical consequences. Greek art and
\par especially Greek tragedy delayed above all the annihilation of myth:
\par it was necessary to annihilate these also to be able to live detached
\par from the native soil, unbridled in the wilderness of thought, custom,
\par and action. Even in such circumstances this metaphysical impulse still
\par endeavours to create for itself a form of apotheosis (weakened, no
\par doubt) in the Socratism of science urging to life: but on its lower
\par stage this same impulse led only to a feverish search, which gradually
\par merged into a pandemonium of myths and superstitions accumulated from
\par all quarters: in the midst of which, nevertheless, the Hellene sat with
\par a yearning heart till he contrived, as Gr\'e6culus, to mask his fever with
\par Greek cheerfulness and Greek levity, or to narcotise himself completely
\par with some gloomy Oriental superstition.
\par 
\par We have approached this condition in the most striking manner since the
\par reawakening of the Alexandro--Roman antiquity in the fifteenth century,
\par after a long, not easily describable, interlude. On the heights there
\par is the same exuberant love of knowledge, the same insatiate happiness
\par of the discoverer, the same stupendous secularisation, and, together
\par with these, a homeless roving about, an eager intrusion at foreign
\par tables, a frivolous deification of the present or a dull senseless
\par estrangement, all _sub speci s\'e6culi,_ of the present time: which
\par same symptoms lead one to infer the same defect at the heart of
\par this culture, the annihilation of myth. It seems hardly possible to
\par transplant a foreign myth with permanent success, without dreadfully
\par injuring the tree through this transplantation: which is perhaps
\par occasionally strong enough and sound enough to eliminate the foreign
\par element after a terrible struggle; but must ordinarily consume itself
\par in a languishing and stunted condition or in sickly luxuriance. Our
\par opinion of the pure and vigorous kernel of the German being is such
\par that we venture to expect of it, and only of it, this elimination of
\par forcibly ingrafted foreign elements, and we deem it possible that
\par the German spirit will reflect anew on itself. Perhaps many a one
\par will be of opinion that this spirit must begin its struggle with the
\par elimination of the Romanic element: for which it might recognise an
\par external preparation and encouragement in the victorious bravery and
\par bloody glory of the late war, but must seek the inner constraint in the
\par emulative zeal to be for ever worthy of the sublime protagonists on
\par this path, of Luther as well as our great artists and poets. But let
\par him never think he can fight such battles without his household gods,
\par without his mythical home, without a "restoration" of all German things
\par I And if the German should look timidly around for a guide to lead
\par him back to his long-lost home, the ways and paths of which he knows
\par no longer--let him but listen to the delightfully luring call of the
\par Dionysian bird, which hovers above him, and would fain point out to him
\par the way thither.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 24.
\par 
\par 
\par Among the peculiar artistic effects of musical tragedy we had to
\par emphasise an Apollonian _illusion,_ through which we are to be saved
\par from immediate oneness with the Dionysian music, while our musical
\par excitement is able to discharge itself on an Apollonian domain and
\par in an interposed visible middle world. It thereby seemed to us that
\par precisely through this discharge the middle world of theatrical
\par procedure, the drama generally, became visible and intelligible from
\par within in a degree unattainable in the other forms of Apollonian art:
\par so that here, where this art was as it were winged and borne aloft by
\par the spirit of music, we had to recognise the highest exaltation of its
\par powers, and consequently in the fraternal union of Apollo and Dionysus
\par the climax of the Apollonian as well as of the Dionysian artistic aims.
\par 
\par Of course, the Apollonian light-picture did not, precisely with this
\par inner illumination through music, attain the peculiar effect of the
\par weaker grades of Apollonian art. What the epos and the animated stone
\par can do--constrain the contemplating eye to calm delight in the world
\par of the _individuatio_--could not be realised here, notwithstanding
\par the greater animation and distinctness. We contemplated the drama
\par and penetrated with piercing glance into its inner agitated world of
\par motives--and yet it seemed as if only a symbolic picture passed before
\par us, the profoundest significance of which we almost believed we had
\par divined, and which we desired to put aside like a curtain in order to
\par behold the original behind it. The greatest distinctness of the picture
\par did not suffice us: for it seemed to reveal as well as veil something;
\par and while it seemed, with its symbolic revelation, to invite the
\par rending of the veil for the disclosure of the mysterious background,
\par this illumined all-conspicuousness itself enthralled the eye and
\par prevented it from penetrating more deeply He who has not experienced
\par this,--to have to view, and at the same time to have a longing
\par beyond the viewing,--will hardly be able to conceive how clearly and
\par definitely these two processes coexist in the contemplation of tragic
\par myth and are felt to be conjoined; while the truly \'e6sthetic spectators
\par will confirm my assertion that among the peculiar effects of tragedy
\par this conjunction is the most noteworthy. Now let this phenomenon of the
\par \'e6sthetic spectator be transferred to an analogous process in the tragic
\par artist, and the genesis of _tragic myth_ will have been understood. It
\par shares with the Apollonian sphere of art the full delight in appearance
\par and contemplation, and at the same time it denies this delight and
\par finds a still higher satisfaction in the annihilation of the visible
\par world of appearance. The substance of tragic myth is first of all an
\par epic event involving the glorification of the fighting hero: but whence
\par originates the essentially enigmatical trait, that the suffering in
\par the fate of the hero, the most painful victories, the most agonising
\par contrasts of motives, in short, the exemplification of the wisdom of
\par Silenus, or, \'e6sthetically expressed, the Ugly and Discordant, is always
\par represented anew in such countless forms with such predilection, and
\par precisely in the most youthful and exuberant age of a people, unless
\par there is really a higher delight experienced in all this?
\par 
\par For the fact that things actually take such a tragic course would
\par least of all explain the origin of a form of art; provided that art
\par is not merely an imitation of the reality of nature, but in truth a
\par metaphysical supplement to the reality of nature, placed alongside
\par thereof for its conquest. Tragic myth, in so far as it really belongs
\par to art, also fully participates in this transfiguring metaphysical
\par purpose of art in general: What does it transfigure, however, when it
\par presents the phenomenal world in the guise of the suffering hero? Least
\par of all the "reality" of this phenomenal world, for it says to us: "Look
\par at this! Look carefully! It is your life! It is the hour-hand of your
\par clock of existence!"
\par 
\par And myth has displayed this life, in order thereby to transfigure it
\par to us? If not, how shall we account for the \'e6sthetic pleasure with
\par which we make even these representations pass before us? I am inquiring
\par concerning the \'e6sthetic pleasure, and am well aware that many of
\par these representations may moreover occasionally create even a moral
\par delectation, say under the form of pity or of a moral triumph. But he
\par who would derive the effect of the tragic exclusively from these moral
\par sources, as was usually the case far too long in \'e6sthetics, let him not
\par think that he has done anything for Art thereby; for Art must above all
\par insist on purity in her domain. For the explanation of tragic myth the
\par very first requirement is that the pleasure which characterises it must
\par be sought in the purely \'e6sthetic sphere, without encroaching on the
\par domain of pity, fear, or the morally-sublime. How can the ugly and the
\par discordant, the substance of tragic myth, excite an \'e6sthetic pleasure?
\par 
\par Here it is necessary to raise ourselves with a daring bound into a
\par metaphysics of Art. I repeat, therefore, my former proposition, that
\par it is only as an \'e6sthetic phenomenon that existence and the world,
\par appear justified: and in this sense it is precisely the function of
\par tragic myth to convince us that even the Ugly and Discordant is an
\par artistic game which the will, in the eternal fulness of its joy, plays
\par with itself. But this not easily comprehensible proto-phenomenon of
\par Dionysian Art becomes, in a direct way, singularly intelligible, and
\par is immediately apprehended in the wonderful significance of _musical
\par dissonance:_ just as in general it is music alone, placed in contrast
\par to the world, which can give us an idea as to what is meant by the
\par justification of the world as an \'e6sthetic phenomenon. The joy that the
\par tragic myth excites has the same origin as the joyful sensation of
\par dissonance in music. The Dionysian, with its primitive joy experienced
\par in pain itself, is the common source of music and tragic myth.
\par 
\par Is it not possible that by calling to our aid the musical relation of
\par dissonance, the difficult problem of tragic effect may have meanwhile
\par been materially facilitated? For we now understand what it means to
\par wish to view tragedy and at the same time to have a longing beyond the
\par viewing: a frame of mind, which, as regards the artistically employed
\par dissonance, we should simply have to characterise by saying that we
\par desire to hear and at the same time have a longing beyond the hearing.
\par That striving for the infinite, the pinion-flapping of longing,
\par accompanying the highest delight in the clearly-perceived reality,
\par remind one that in both states we have to recognise a Dionysian
\par phenomenon, which again and again reveals to us anew the playful
\par up-building and demolishing of the world of individuals as the efflux
\par of a primitive delight, in like manner as when Heraclitus the Obscure
\par compares the world-building power to a playing child which places
\par stones here and there and builds sandhills only to overthrow them again.
\par 
\par Hence, in order to form a true estimate of the Dionysian capacity of
\par a people, it would seem that we must think not only of their music,
\par but just as much of their tragic myth, the second witness of this
\par capacity. Considering this most intimate relationship between music
\par and myth, we may now in like manner suppose that a degeneration and
\par depravation of the one involves a deterioration of the other: if it be
\par true at all that the weakening of the myth is generally expressive of
\par a debilitation of the Dionysian capacity. Concerning both, however,
\par a glance at the development of the German genius should not leave
\par us in any doubt; in the opera just as in the abstract character of
\par our myth-less existence, in an art sunk to pastime just as in a life
\par guided by concepts, the inartistic as well as life-consuming nature
\par of Socratic optimism had revealed itself to us. Yet there have been
\par indications to console us that nevertheless in some inaccessible abyss
\par the German spirit still rests and dreams, undestroyed, in glorious
\par health, profundity, and Dionysian strength, like a knight sunk in
\par slumber: from which abyss the Dionysian song rises to us to let us
\par know that this German knight even still dreams his primitive Dionysian
\par myth in blissfully earnest visions. Let no one believe that the German
\par spirit has for ever lost its mythical home when it still understands so
\par obviously the voices of the birds which tell of that home. Some day it
\par will find itself awake in all the morning freshness of a deep sleep:
\par then it will slay the dragons, destroy the malignant dwarfs, and waken
\par Br\'fcnnhilde--and Wotan's spear itself will be unable to obstruct its
\par course!
\par 
\par My friends, ye who believe in Dionysian music, ye know also what
\par tragedy means to us. There we have tragic myth, born anew from
\par music,--and in this latest birth ye can hope for everything and forget
\par what is most afflicting. What is most afflicting to all of us, however,
\par is--the prolonged degradation in which the German genius has lived
\par estranged from house and home in the service of malignant dwarfs. Ye
\par understand my allusion--as ye will also, in conclusion, understand my
\par hopes.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 25.
\par 
\par 
\par Music and tragic myth are equally the expression of the Dionysian
\par capacity of a people, and are inseparable from each other. Both
\par originate in an ultra Apollonian sphere of art; both transfigure a
\par region in the delightful accords of which all dissonance, just like
\par the terrible picture of the world, dies charmingly away; both play
\par with the sting of displeasure, trusting to their most potent magic;
\par both justify thereby the existence even of the "worst world." Here
\par the Dionysian, as compared with the Apollonian, exhibits itself as
\par the eternal and original artistic force, which in general calls into
\par existence the entire world of phenomena: in the midst of which a new
\par transfiguring appearance becomes necessary, in order to keep alive the
\par animated world of individuation. If we could conceive an incarnation
\par of dissonance--and what is man but that?--then, to be able to live
\par this dissonance would require a glorious illusion which would spread
\par a veil of beauty over its peculiar nature. This is the true function
\par of Apollo as deity of art: in whose name we comprise all the countless
\par manifestations of the fair realm of illusion, which each moment render
\par life in general worth living and make one impatient for the experience
\par of the next moment.
\par 
\par At the same time, just as much of this basis of all existence--the
\par Dionysian substratum of the world--is allowed to enter into the
\par consciousness of human beings, as can be surmounted again by the
\par Apollonian transfiguring power, so that these two art-impulses are
\par constrained to develop their powers in strictly mutual proportion,
\par according to the law of eternal justice. When the Dionysian powers rise
\par with such vehemence as we experience at present, there can be no doubt
\par that, veiled in a cloud, Apollo has already descended to us; whose
\par grandest beautifying influences a coming generation will perhaps behold.
\par 
\par That this effect is necessary, however, each one would most surely
\par perceive by intuition, if once he found himself carried back--even in
\par a dream--into an Old-Hellenic existence. In walking under high Ionic
\par colonnades, looking upwards to a horizon defined by clear and noble
\par lines, with reflections of his transfigured form by his side in shining
\par marble, and around him solemnly marching or quietly moving men, with
\par harmoniously sounding voices and rhythmical pantomime, would he not in
\par the presence of this perpetual influx of beauty have to raise his hand
\par to Apollo and exclaim: "Blessed race of Hellenes! How great Dionysus
\par must be among you, when the Delian god deems such charms necessary
\par to cure you of your dithyrambic madness!"--To one in this frame of
\par mind, however, an aged Athenian, looking up to him with the sublime
\par eye of \'c6schylus, might answer: "Say also this, thou curious stranger:
\par what sufferings this people must have undergone, in order to be able
\par to become thus beautiful! But now follow me to a tragic play, and
\par sacrifice with me in the temple of both the deities!"

\par APPENDIX.
\par 
\par 
\par [Late in the year 1888, not long before he was overcome by his sudden
\par attack of insanity, Nietzsche wrote down a few notes concerning
\par his early work, the _Birth of Tragedy._ These were printed in his
\par sister's biography (_Das Leben Friedrich Nietzsches,_ vol. ii. pt.
\par i. pp. 102 ff.), and are here translated as likely to be of interest
\par to readers of this remarkable work. They also appear in the _Ecce
\par Homo._--TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.]
\par 
\par "To be just to the _Birth of Tragedy_(1872), one will have to forget
\par some few things. It has _wrought effects,_ it even fascinated through
\par that wherein it was amiss--through its application to _Wagnerism,_
\par just as if this Wagnerism were symptomatic of _a rise and going up._
\par And just on that account was the book an event in Wagner's life: from
\par thence and only from thence were great hopes linked to the name of
\par Wagner. Even to-day people remind me, sometimes right in the midst of
\par a talk on _Parsifal,_ that _I_ and none other have it on my conscience
\par that such a high opinion of the _cultural value_ of this movement came
\par to the top. More than once have I found the book referred to as 'the
\par _Re_-birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music': one only had an ear
\par for a new formula of _Wagner's_ art, aim, task,--and failed to hear
\par withal what was at bottom valuable therein. 'Hellenism and Pessimism'
\par had been a more unequivocal title: namely, as a first lesson on the
\par way in which the Greeks got the better of pessimism,--on the means
\par whereby they _overcame_ it. Tragedy simply proves that the Greeks were
\par _no_ pessimists: Schopenhauer was mistaken here as he was mistaken
\par in all other things. Considered with some neutrality, the _Birth of
\par Tragedy_ appears very unseasonable: one would not even dream that
\par it was _begun_ amid the thunders of the battle of W\'f6rth. I thought
\par these problems through and through before the walls of Metz in cold
\par September nights, in the midst of the work of nursing the sick; one
\par might even believe the book to be fifty years older. It is politically
\par indifferent--un-German one will say to-day,--it smells shockingly
\par Hegelian, in but a few formul\'e6 does it scent of Schopenhauer's
\par funereal perfume. An 'idea'--the antithesis of 'Dionysian _versus_
\par Apollonian'--translated into metaphysics; history itself as the
\par evolution of this 'idea'; the antithesis dissolved into oneness
\par in Tragedy; through this optics things that had never yet looked
\par into one another's face, confronted of a sudden, and illumined and
\par _comprehended_ through one another: for instance, Opera and Revolution.
\par The two decisive _innovations_ of the book are, on the one hand, the
\par comprehension of the _Dionysian_ phenomenon among the Greeks (it gives
\par the first psychology thereof, it sees therein the One root of all
\par Grecian art); on the other, the comprehension of Socratism: Socrates
\par diagnosed for the first time as the tool of Grecian dissolution, as
\par a typical decadent. 'Rationality' _against_ instinct! 'Rationality'
\par at any price as a dangerous, as a life-undermining force! Throughout
\par the whole book a deep hostile silence on Christianity: it is neither
\par Apollonian nor Dionysian; it _negatives_ all _\'e6sthetic_ values (the
\par only values recognised by the _Birth of Tragedy),_ it is in the widest
\par sense nihilistic, whereas in the Dionysian symbol the utmost limit
\par of _affirmation_ is reached. Once or twice the Christian priests are
\par alluded to as a 'malignant kind of dwarfs,' as 'subterraneans.'"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 2.
\par 
\par 
\par "This beginning is singular beyond measure. I had for my own inmost
\par experience _discovered_ the only symbol and counterpart of history,--I
\par had just thereby been the first to grasp the wonderful phenomenon
\par of the Dionysian. And again, through my diagnosing Socrates as a
\par decadent, I had given a wholly unequivocal proof of how little risk
\par the trustworthiness of my psychological grasp would run of being
\par weakened by some moralistic idiosyncrasy--to view morality itself as a
\par symptom of decadence is an innovation, a novelty of the first rank in
\par the history of knowledge. How far I had leaped in either case beyond
\par the smug shallow-pate-gossip of optimism _contra_ pessimism! I was
\par the first to see the intrinsic antithesis: here, the _degenerating_
\par instinct which, with subterranean vindictiveness, turns against life
\par (Christianity, the philosophy of Schopenhauer, in a certain sense
\par already the philosophy of Plato, all idealistic systems as typical
\par forms), and there, a formula of _highest affirmation,_ born of fullness
\par and overfullness, a yea-saying without reserve to suffering's self,
\par to guilt's self, to all that is questionable and strange in existence
\par itself. This final, cheerfullest, exuberantly mad-and-merriest Yea to
\par life is not only the highest insight, it is also the _deepest,_ it
\par is that which is most rigorously confirmed and upheld by truth and
\par science. Naught that is, is to be deducted, naught is dispensable; the
\par phases of existence rejected by the Christians and other nihilists are
\par even of an infinitely higher order in the hierarchy of values than
\par that which the instinct of decadence sanctions, yea durst _sanction._
\par To comprehend this _courage_ is needed, and, as a condition thereof, a
\par surplus of _strength_: for precisely in degree as courage _dares_ to
\par thrust forward, precisely according to the measure of strength, does
\par one approach truth. Perception, the yea-saying to reality, is as much
\par a necessity to the strong as to the weak, under the inspiration of
\par weakness, cowardly shrinking, and _flight_ from reality--the 'ideal.'
\par ... They are not free to perceive: the decadents have _need_ of the
\par lie,--it is one of their conditions of self-preservation. Whoso not
\par only comprehends the word Dionysian, but also grasps his _self_ in
\par this word, requires no refutation of Plato or of Christianity or of
\par Schopenhauer--_he smells the putrefaction._"
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 3.
\par 
\par 
\par "To what extent I had just thereby found the concept 'tragic,' the
\par definitive perception of the psychology of tragedy, I have but lately
\par stated in the _Twilight of the Idols,_ page 139 (1st edit.): 'The
\par affirmation of life, even in its most unfamiliar and severe problems,
\par the will to life, enjoying its own inexhaustibility in the sacrifice
\par of its highest types,--_that_ is what I called Dionysian, that is
\par what I divined as the bridge to a psychology of the _tragic_ poet.
\par Not in order to get rid of terror and pity, not to purify from a
\par dangerous passion by its vehement discharge (it was thus that Aristotle
\par misunderstood it); but, beyond terror and pity, _to realise in fact_
\par the eternal delight of becoming, that delight which even involves in
\par itself the _joy of annihilating!_[1] In this sense I have the right
\par to understand myself to be the first _tragic philosopher_--that is,
\par the utmost antithesis and antipode to a pessimistic philosopher. Prior
\par to myself there is no such translation of the Dionysian into the
\par philosophic pathos: there lacks the _tragic wisdom,_--I have sought
\par in vain for an indication thereof even among the _great_ Greeks of
\par philosophy, the thinkers of the two centuries _before_ Socrates. A
\par doubt still possessed me as touching _Heraclitus,_ in whose proximity
\par I in general begin to feel warmer and better than anywhere else. The
\par affirmation of transiency _and annihilation,_ to wit the decisive
\par factor in a Dionysian _philosophy,_ the yea-saying to antithesis
\par and war, to _becoming,_ with radical rejection even of the concept
\par '_being,_'--that I must directly acknowledge as, of all thinking
\par hitherto, the nearest to my own. The doctrine of 'eternal recurrence,'
\par that is, of the unconditioned and infinitely repeated cycle of all
\par things--this doctrine of Zarathustra's _might_ after all have been
\par already taught by Heraclitus. At any rate the portico[2] which
\par inherited well-nigh all its fundamental conceptions from Heraclitus,
\par shows traces thereof."
\par 
\par [Illustration: _Facsimile of Nietzsches handwriting._]

\par 
\par 
\par "In this book speaks a prodigious hope. In fine, I see no reason
\par whatever for taking back my hope of a Dionysian future for music. Let
\par us cast a glance a century ahead, let us suppose my assault upon two
\par millenniums of anti-nature and man-vilification succeeds! That new
\par party of life which will take in hand the greatest of all tasks, the
\par upbreeding of mankind to something higher,--add thereto the relentless
\par annihilation of all things degenerating and parasitic, will again make
\par possible on earth that _too-much of life,_ from which there also must
\par needs grow again the Dionysian state. I promise a _tragic_ age: the
\par highest art in the yea-saying to life, tragedy, will be born anew, when
\par mankind have behind them the consciousness of the hardest but most
\par necessary wars, _without suffering therefrom._ A psychologist might
\par still add that what I heard in my younger years in Wagnerian music had
\par in general naught to do with Wagner; that when I described Wagnerian
\par music I described what _I_ had heard, that I had instinctively to
\par translate and transfigure all into the new spirit which I bore within
\par myself...."

\par TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.
\par 
\par 
\par While the translator flatters himself that this version of Nietzsche's
\par early work--having been submitted to unsparingly scrutinising eyes--is
\par not altogether unworthy of the original, he begs to state that he
\par holds twentieth-century English to be a rather unsatisfactory vehicle
\par for philosophical thought. Accordingly, in conjunction with his
\par friend Dr. Ernest Lacy, he has prepared a second, more unconventional
\par translation,--in brief, a translation which will enable one whose
\par knowledge of English extends to, say, the period of Elizabeth, to
\par appreciate Nietzsche in more forcible language, because the language of
\par a stronger age. It is proposed to provide this second translation with
\par an appendix, containing many references to the translated writings of
\par Wagner and Schopenhauer; to the works of Pater, Browning, Burckhardt,
\par Rohde, and others, and a summmary and index.
\par 
\par For help in preparing the present translation, the translator wishes
\par to express his thanks to his friends Dr. Ernest Lacy, Litt.D.; Dr.
\par James Waddell Tupper, Ph.D.; Prof. Harry Max Ferren; Mr. James M'Kirdy,
\par Pittsburg; and Mr. Thomas Common, Edinburgh.

\par Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
\par assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
\par goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
\par remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
\par Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
\par and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
\par generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
\par Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

\par Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
\par Literary Archive Foundation
\par 
\par Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
\par spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
\par increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
\par freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
\par array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
\par ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
\par status with the IRS.
\par 
\par The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
\par charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
\par States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
\par considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
\par with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
\par where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
\par DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
\par state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
\par 
\par While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
\par have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
\par against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
\par approach us with offers to donate.
\par 
\par International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
\par any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
\par outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
\par 
\par Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
\par methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
\par ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
\par donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

\par Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.
\par 
\par Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
\par Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
\par freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
\par distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
\par volunteer support.
\par 
\par Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
\par editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
\par the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
\par necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
\par edition.
\par 
\par Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
\par facility: www.gutenberg.org
\par 
\par This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
\par including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
\par Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
\par subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
