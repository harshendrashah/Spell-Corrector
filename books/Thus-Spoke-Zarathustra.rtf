\par might be reared who ivould be both different from and higher 
\par than those who heretofore have owed their existence to mere 
\par chance. Here we may still be hopeful : in the rearing of excep 
\par tional men." 
\par 
\par The notion of rearing the Superman is only a new form of 
\par an ideal Nietzsche already had in his youth, that "the object 
\par of mankind should lie in its highest individuals" (or, as he 
\par writes in "Schopenhauer as Educator": "Mankind ought con 
\par stantly to be striving to produce great men this and nothing 
\par else is its duty." ) . But the ideals he most revered in those days 
\par are no longer held to be the highest types of men. No, around 
\par this future ideal of a coming humanity the Superman the 
\par poet spread the veil of becoming. Who can tell to what glorious 
\par heights man can still ascend? That is why, after having tested 
\par the worth of our noblest ideal that of the Saviour, in the 
\par light of the new valuations, the poet cries with passionate 
\par emphasis in "Zarathustra" : 
\par 
\par "Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen 
\par both of them, the greatest and the smallest man: 
\par 
\par "All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily even the 
\par greatest found I all-too-human!"

\par INTRODUCTION XI 
\par 
\par The phrase "the rearing of the Superman," has very often 
\par been misunderstood. By the word "rearing," in this case, is 
\par meant the act of modifying by means of new and higher values 
\par values which, as laws and guides of conduct and opinion, are 
\par now to rule over mankind. In general the doctrine of the 
\par Superman can only be understood correctly in conjunction with 
\par other ideas of the author s, such as: the Order of Rank, the 
\par Will to Power, and the Transvaluation of All Values. He 
\par assumes tha.t Christianity^ as a product of the resentment of 
\par the botched and the weak, has put in ban all that is beautiful, / 
\par strong, prou3, and powerful 1 * 1 ml ac"taff the qualities resulting 
\par from strength, and that, in consequence, all forces which tend 
\par 
\par promote or elevate" iTTe have been seriously undermined

\par 
\par however, a new table of valuations must be placed ove* "~ J 
\par mankind namely, that of the strong, mighty, and magnifi 
\par cent man, overflowing with life and elevated to his zenith the 
\par Superman^ who is now put before us with overpowering pas 
\par sion as the aim of our life, hope, and will. And just as the oldi 
\par system of valuing., which only extolled the qualities favorable 
\par to the weak, the suffering, and the oppressed, has succeeded in 
\par producing a weak, suffering, and "modern" race, so this new 
\par and reversed system of valuing ought to rear a healthy, strong, 
\par lively, and courageous type, which would be a glory to life 
\par itself. Stated briefly, the leading ; principle of this new system 
\par of valuing would be: "All that proceeds from power is good, 
\par all that springs from weakness is bad. 
\par 
\par This type must not be regarded as a fanciful figure: it is not 
\par a nebulous hope which is to be realized at some indefinitely 
\par remote period, thousands of years hence; nor is it a new species 
\par ( in the Darwinian sense) of which we can know nothing, and 
\par which it would therefore be somewhat absurd to strive after, 
\par but it is meant tc be a possibility which men of the present 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Xll INTRODUCTION 
\par 
\par could realize with all their spiritual and physical energies, pro 
\par vided they adopted the new values. 
\par 
\par The author of "Zarathustra" never lost sight of that egre 
\par gious example of a transvaluation of all values through Chris 
\par tianity, whereby the whole of the deified mode of life and 
\par thought of the Greeks,, as well as strong Romedom, was almost 
\par annihilated or transvalued, in a comparatively short time. 
\par Could not a rejuvenated Grasco-Roman system of valuing 
\par (once it had been refined and made more profound by the 
\par schooling which two thousand years of Christianity had pro 
\par vided ) effect another such revolution within a calculable period 
\par of time, until that glorious type of manhood shall finally ap 
\par pear which is to be our new faith and hope, and in the creation 
\par of which Zarathustra exhorts us to participate? 
\par 
\par In his private notes on the subject the author uses the ex 
\par pression "Superman" (always in the singular, by-the-bye), as 
\par signifying "the most thoroughly well-constituted type," as 
\par opposed to "modern man"; above all, however, he designates 
\par Zarathustra himself as an example of the Superman. In "Ecce 
\par Homo" he is careful to enlighten us concerning the precursors 
\par and prerequisites to the advent of this highest type, in referring 
\par to a certain passage in "The Joyful Wisdom": 
\par 
\par "In order to understand this type, we must first be quite clear 
\par in regard to the leading physiological condition on which it 
\par depends: this condition is what I call great healthiness. I know 
\par not how to express my meaning more plainly or more per 
\par sonally than I have done already in one of the last chapters 
\par (Aphorism 382) of the fifth book of "The Joyful Wisdom": 
\par 
\par "We, the new, the nameless, the hard-to-imderstand" it says there 
\par "we firstlings of a yet untried future \\ve require for a new end also a 
\par new means, namely, a new healthiness, stronger, sharper, tougher, bolder 
\par and merrier than all healthiness hitherto. He whose soul lungeth t*

\par 
\par experience the whole range of hitherto recognized values and desirabilities, 
\par and to circumnavigate all the coasts of this ideal Mediterranean Sea, 
\par who, from the adventures of his most personal experience, wants to know 
\par how it feels to be a conqueror, and discoverer of the ideal as likewise 
\par how it is with the artist, the saint, the legislator, the sage, the scholar, the 
\par devotee, the prophet, and the godly non-conformist of the old style 
\par requires one thing above all for that purpose, great healthiness such 
\par healthiness as one not only possesses, but also constantly acquires and must 
\par acquire, because one unceasingly sacrifices it again, and must sacrifice it! 
\par And now, after having been long on the way in this fashion, we Argo 
\par nauts of the ideal, more courageous perhaps than prudent, and often 
\par enough shipwrecked and brought to grief, nevertheless dangerously 
\par healthy, always healthy again it would seem as if, in recompense for 
\par it all, that we have a still undiscovered country before us, the boundaries 
\par of which no one has yet seen, a beyond to all countries and corners of 
\par the ideal known hitherto, a world so over-rich in the beautiful, the 
\par strange, the questionable, the frightful, and the divine, that our curiosity 
\par as well as our thirst for possession thereof, have got out of hand alas! 
\par rhat nothing will now any longer satisfy us! 
\par 
\par "How could we still be content with the man of the present day after 
\par such outlooks, and with such a craving in our conscience and conscious 
\par ness? Sad enough; but it is unavoidable that we should look on the 
\par worthiest aims and hopes of the man of the present day with ill-concealed 
\par amusement, and perhaps should no longer look at them. Another ideal 
\par runs on before us, a strange, tempting ideal full of danger, to which we 
\par should not like to persuade any one, because we do not so readily acknowl 
\par edge any one s right thereto: the ideal of a spirit who plays naively (that 
\par is to say involuntarily and from overflowing abundance and power) with 
\par everything that has hitherto been called holy, good, intangible, or divine; 
\par to whom the loftiest conception which the people have reasonably made 
\par their measure of value, would already practically imply danger, ruin, 
\par abasement, or at least relaxation, blindness, or temporary self-forgetful- 
\par ness; the ideal of a humanly superhuman welfare and benevolence, which 
\par will often enough appear inhuman, for example, when put alongside of 
\par all past seriousness on earth, and alongside of all past solemnities in bear 
\par ing, word, tone, look, morality, and pursuit, as their truest involuntary 
\par parody and with which, nevertheless, perhaps the great seriousness only

\par 
\par commences, when the proper interrogative mark is set up, the fate of the 
\par soul changes, the hour-hand moves, and tragedy begins. . . ." 
\par 
\par Although the figure of Zarathustra and a large number of 
\par the leading thoughts in this work had appeared much earliei 
\par in the dreams and writings of the author, "Thus Spake Zara 
\par thustra" did not actually come into being until the month of 
\par August, 1 88 1, in Sils-Maria; and it was the idea of the Eternal 
\par Recurrence of all things which finally induced my brother to 
\par set forth his new views in poetic language. In regard to his first 
\par conception of this idea, his autobiographical sketch, "Ecce, 
\par Homo," written in the autumn of 1888, contains the following 
\par passage: 
\par 
\par "The fundamental idea of my work namely, the Eternal 
\par Recurrence of all things this highest of all possible formulas 
\par of a Yea-saying philosophy, first occurred to me in August, 
\par 1 88 1. I made a note of the thought on a sheet of paper, with 
\par the postscript: 6,000 feet beyond men and time! That day I 
\par happened to be wandering through the woods alongside of 
\par the lake of Silvaplana, and I halted beside a huge, pyramidal 
\par and towering rock not far from Surlei. It was then that the 
\par thought struck me. Looking back now, I find that exactly two 
\par months previous to this inspiration, I had had an omen of its 
\par coming in the form of a sudden and decisive alteration in my 
\par tastes more particularly in music. It would even be possible 
\par to consider all Zarathustra as a musical composition. At all 
\par events, a very necessary condition in its production was a 
\par renaissance in myself of the art of hearing. In a small mountain 
\par resort (Recoaro) near Vicenza, where I spent the spring of 
\par 1 88 1, 1 and my friend and Maestro, Peter Cast also one who 
\par had been born again discovered that the phoenix music that 
\par hovered over us, wore lighter and brighter plumes than it had 
\par done theretofore." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par INTRODUCTION X* 
\par 
\par During the month of August, 1881, my brother resolved to 
\par reveal the teaching of the Eternal Recurrence, in dithyrambic 
\par and psalmodic form, through the mouth of Zarathustra. 
\par Among the notes of this period, we found a page on which is 
\par written the first definite plan of "Thus Spake Zarathustra": 
\par 
\par "MIDDAY AND ETERNITY." 
\par "GUIDE-POSTS TO A NEW WAY OF LIVING/ 
\par Beneath this is written: 
\par 
\par "Zarathustra born on lake Urmi; left his home in his thirtieth year, 
\par went into the province of Aria, and, during ten years of solitude in the 
\par mountains, composed the Zend-Avesta." 
\par 
\par "The sun of knowledge stands once more at midday; and the serpent 
\par of eternity lies coiled in its light : It is your time, ye midday brethren. 
\par 
\par In that summer of 1881, my brother, after many years of 
\par steadily declining health, began at last to rally, and it is to this 
\par first gush of the recovery of his once splendid bodily condition 
\par that we owe not only "The Joyful Wisdom," which in its mood 
\par may be regarded as a prelude to "Zarathustra," but also "Zara 
\par thustra" itself. Just as he was beginning to recuperate his 
\par health^ however, an unkind destiny brought him a number of 
\par most painful personal experiences. His friends caused him 
\par many disappointments, which were the more bitter to him, in 
\par asmuch as he regarded friendship as such a sacred institution; 
\par and for the first time in his life he realized the whole horror 
\par of that loneliness to which, perhaps, all greatness is con 
\par demned. But to be forsaken is something very different from 
\par deliberately choosing blessed loneliness. How he longed, in 
\par those days, for the ideal friend who would thoroughly under 
\par stand him, to whom he would be able to say all, and whom he 
\par imagined he had found at various periods in his life from his 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XVI INTRODUCTION 
\par 
\par earliest youth onwards. Now, however, that the way he had 
\par chosen grew ever more perilous and steep, he found nobody 
\par who could follow him: he therefore created a perfect friend 
\par for himself in the ideal form of a majestic philosopher, and 
\par made this creation the preacher of his gospel to the world. 
\par 
\par Whether my brother would ever have written "Thus Spake 
\par Zarathustra" according to the first plan sketched in the sum 
\par mer of 1 88 1, if he had not had the disappointments already 
\par referred to, is now an idle question; but perhaps where "Zara 
\par thustra" is concerned, we may also say with Master Eckhardt: 
\par "The fleetest beast to bear you to perfection is suffering." 
\par 
\par My brother writes as follows about the origin of the first 
\par part of "Zarathustra": "In the winter of 1882-83. I was 
\par living on the charming little Gulf of Rapallo, not far from 
\par Genoa, and between Chiavari and Cape Porto Fino. My health 
\par was not very good; the winter was cold and exceptionally rainy; 
\par and the small inn in which I lived was so close to the water 
\par that at night my sleep would be disturbed if the sea were high. 
\par These circumstances were surely the very reverse of favorable; 
\par and yet in spite of it all, and as if in demonstration of my belief 
\par that everything decisive comes to life in spite of every obstacle, 
\par it was precisely during this winter and in the midst of these un 
\par favorable circumstances that my Zarathustra originated. In 
\par the morning I used to start out in a southerly direction up the 
\par glorious road to Zoagli, which rises aloft through a forest of 
\par pines and gives one a view far out into the sea. In the after 
\par noon, as often as my health permitted, I walked round the 
\par whole bay from Santa Margherita to beyond Porto Fino. This 
\par spot was all the more interesting to me, inasmuch as it was so 
\par dearly loved by the Emperor Frederick III. In the autumn of 
\par 1886 I chanced to be there again when he was revisiting this 
\par small, forgotten world of happiness for the last time. It was on 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par INTRODUCTION 
\par 
\par these two roads that all Zarathustra came to me, above all 
\par Zarathustra himself as a type; I ought rather to say that it was 
\par on these walks that these ideas waylaid me." 
\par 
\par The first part of "Zarathustra" was written in about ten 
\par days that is to say, from the beginning to about the middle 
\par of February, 1883. "The last lines were written precisely in the 
\par hallowed hour when Richard Wagner gave up the ghost in 
\par Venice." 
\par 
\par With the exception of the ten days occupied in composing 
\par the first part of this book, my brother often referred to this 
\par winter as the hardest and sickliest he had ever experienced. He 
\par did not, however, mean thereby that his former disorders were 
\par troubling him, but that he was suffering from a severe attack 
\par of influenza which he had caught in Santa Margherita, and 
\par which tormented him for several weeks after his arrival in 
\par Genoa. As a matter of fact, however, what he complained of 
\par most was his spiritual condition that indescribable forsaken 
\par ness to which he gives such heartrending expression in 
\par "Zarathustra." Even the reception which the first part met 
\par with at the hands of friends and acquaintances was extremely 
\par disheartening: for almost all those to whom he presented 
\par copies of the work misunderstood it. "I found no one ripe for 
\par many of my thoughts; the case of Zarathustra proves that one 
\par can speak with the utmost clearness, and yet not be heard by 
\par any one." My brother was very much discouraged by the feeble 
\par ness of the response he was given, and as he was striving just 
\par then to give up the practice of taking hydrate of chloral a 
\par drug he had begun to take while ill with influenza the fol 
\par lowing spring, spent in Rome, was a somewhat gloomy one 
\par for him. He writes about it as follows: "I spent a melancholy 
\par spring in Rome, where I only just managed to live and this 
\par was no easy matter. This city, which is absolutely unsuited tq 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XVlli INTRODUCTION 
\par 
\par the poet-author of Zarathustra, and for the choice of which I 
\par was not responsible, made me inordinately miserable. I tried to 
\par leave it. I wanted to go to Aquila the opposite of Rome in 
\par every respect, and actually founded in a spirit of enmity to 
\par wards that city (just as I also shall found a city some day) , as 
\par a memento of an atheist and genuine enemy of the Church a 
\par person very closely related to me the great Hohenstaufen, 
\par the Emperor Frederick II. But Fate lay behind it all: I had to 
\par return again to Rome. In the end I was obliged to be satisfied 
\par with the Piazza Barberini, after I had exerted myself in vain to 
\par find an anti-Christian quarter. I fear that on one occasion, to 
\par avoid bad smells as much as possible, I actually inquired at the 
\par Palazzo del Quirinale whether they could not provide a quiet 
\par room for a philosopher. In a chamber high above the Piazza 
\par just mentioned, from which one obtained a general view of 
\par Rome and could hear the fountains plashing far below, the 
\par loneliest of all songs was composed The Night-Song. About 
\par this time I was obsessed by an unspeakably sad melody, the 
\par refrain of which I recognised in the words, dead through im 
\par mortality. 
\par 
\par We remained somewhat too long in Rome that spring, and 
\par what with the effect of the increasing heat and the discour 
\par aging circumstances already described, my brother resolved not 
\par to write any more, or in any case, not to proceed with "Zara 
\par thustra," although I offered to relieve him of all trouble in 
\par connection with the proofs and the publisher. When, how 
\par ever, we returned to Switzerland towards the end of June, and 
\par he found himself once more in the familiar and exhilarating 
\par air of the mountains, all his joyous creative powers revived, and 
\par in a note to me announcing the dispatch of some manuscript, 
\par he wrote as follows: "I have engaged a place heie for three 
\par months : forsooth, I am the greatest fool to allow my courage to 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par INTRODUCTION XIX 
\par 
\par be sapped from me by the climate of Italy. Now and again I 
\par am troubled by the thought: what next? My future is the 
\par darkest thing in the world to me, but as there still remains a 
\par great deal for me to do, I suppose I ought rather to think of 
\par doing this than of my future, and leave the rest to thee and 
\par the gods." 
\par 
\par The second part of "Zarathustra" was written between the 
\par 26th of June and the 6th July. "This summer, finding myself 
\par once more in the sacred place where the first thought of 
\par Zarathustra flashed across my mind, I conceived the second 
\par part. Ten days sufficed. Neither for the second, the first, nor 
\par the third part, have I required a day longer." 
\par 
\par He often used to speak of the ecstatic mood in which he 
\par wrote "Zarathustra"; how in his walks over hill and dale the 
\par ideas would crowd into his mind, and how he would note 
\par them down hastily in a notebook from which he would tran 
\par scribe them on his return, sometimes working till midnight. He 
\par says in a letter to me: "You can have no idea of the vehemence 
\par of such composition," and in "Ecce Homo" (autumn 1888) he 
\par describes as follows with passionate enthusiasm the incom 
\par parable mood in which he created Zarathustra: 
\par 
\par Has any one at the end of the nineteenth century any 
\par distinct notion of what poets of a stronger age understood by 
\par the word inspiration? If not, I will describe it. If one had the 
\par smallest vestige of superstition in one, it would hardly be 
\par possible to set aside completely the idea that one is the mere 
\par incarnation, mouthpiece or medium of an almighty power. The 
\par idea of revelation in the sense that something becomes sud 
\par denly visible and audible with indescribable certainty and 
\par accuracy, which profoundly convulses and upsets one de 
\par scribes simply the matter of fact. One hears one does not 
\par seek; one takes one does not ask who gives: a thought sud- 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XX INTRODUCTION 
\par 
\par denly flashes up like lightning, it comes with necessity, un 
\par hesitatingly I have never had any choice in the matter. There 
\par is an ecstasy such that the immense strain of it is sometimes 
\par relaxed by a flood of tears, along with which one s steps either 
\par rush or involuntarily lag, alternately. There is the feeling that 
\par one is completely out of hand, with the very distinct conscious 
\par ness of an endless number of fine thrills and quiverings to the 
\par very toes; there is a depth of happiness in which the pain- 
\par fullest and gloomiest do not operate as antitheses, but as con 
\par ditioned, as demanded in the sense of necessary shades of 
\par colour in such an overflow of light. There is an instinct for 
\par rhythmic relations which embraces wide areas of forms 
\par (length, the need of a wide-embracing rhythm, is almost the 
\par measure of the force of an inspiration, a sort of counterpart 
\par to its pressure and tension) . Everything happens quite involun 
\par tarily, as if in a tempestuous outburst of freedom, of absolute 
\par ness, of power and divinity. The involuntariness of the figures 
\par and similes is the most remarkable thing; one loses all percep 
\par tion of what constitutes the figure and what constitutes the 
\par simile; everything seems to present itself as the readiest, the 
\par correctest and the simplest means of expression. It actually 
\par seems, to use one of Zarathustra s own phrases, as if all things 
\par came unto one, and would fain be similes: Here do all things 
\par come caressingly to thy talk and flatter thee, for they want to 
\par ride upon thy back. On every simile dost thou here ride to 
\par every truth. Here fly open unto thee all being s words and 
\par word-cabinets; here all being wanteth to become words, here 
\par all becoming wanteth to learn of thee how to talk. This is my 
\par experience of inspiration. I do not doubt but that one would 
\par have to go back thousands of years in order to find some one 
\par who could say to me: It is mine also! " 
\par 
\par In the autumn of 1883 my brother left the Engadine for 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par INTRODUCTION XXI 
\par 
\par Germany and stayed there a few weeks. In the following 
\par winter, after wandering somewhat erratically through Stresa, 
\par Genoa, and Spezia, he landed in Nice, where the climate so 
\par happily promoted his creative powers that he wrote the third 
\par part of "Zarathustra." "In the winter, beneath the halcyon 
\par sky of Nice, which then looked down upon me for the first 
\par time in my life, I found the third Zarathustra and came to 
\par the end of my task; the whole having occupied me scarcely a 
\par year. Many hidden corners and heights in the landscapes round 
\par about Nice are hallowed to me by unforgettable moments. That 
\par decisive chapter entitled Old and New Tables was composed 
\par in the very difficult ascent from the station to Eza that won 
\par derful Moorish village in the rocks. My most creative moments 
\par were always accompanied by unusual muscular activity. The 
\par body is inspired: let us waive the question of the soul. I 
\par might often have been seen dancing in those days. Without a 
\par suggestion of fatigue I could then walk for seven or eight 
\par hours on end among the hills. I slept well and laughed well 
\par I was perfectly robust and patient." 
\par 
\par As we have seen, each of the three parts of "Zarathustra" 
\par was written, after a more or less short period of preparation 
\par in about ten days. The composition of the fourth part alone 
\par was broken by occasional interruptions. The first notes relating 
\par to this part were written while he and I were staying together 
\par in Zurich in September 1884. In the following November, 
\par while staying at Mentone, he began to elaborate these notes, 
\par and after a long pause, finished the manuscript at Nice be 
\par tween the end of January and the middle of February 1885. M) 
\par brother then called this part the fourth and last; but even be 
\par fore, and shortly after it had been privately printed, he wrote 
\par to me saying that he still intended writing a fifth and sixth part, 
\par and notes relating to these parts are now in my possession. This 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par XX11 INTRODUCTION 
\par 
\par fourth part (the original MS. of which contains this note: 
\par "Only for my friends, not for the public") is written in a 
\par paiticularly personal spirit, and those few to whom he pre 
\par sented a copy of it, he pledged to the strictest secrecy concern 
\par ing its contents. He often thought of making this fourth part 
\par public also, but doubted whether he would ever be able to do 
\par so without considerably altering certain portions of it. At all 
\par events he resolved to distribute this manuscript production, of 
\par which only forty copies were printed, only among those who 
\par had proved themselves worthy of it, and it speaks eloquently 
\par of his utter loneliness and need of sympathy in those days, that 
\par he had occasion to present only seven copies of his book accord 
\par ing to this resolution. 
\par 
\par Already at the beginning of this history I hinted at the rea 
\par sons which led my brother to select a Persian as the incarnation 
\par of his ideal of the majestic philosopher. His reasons, however, 
\par for choosing Zarathustra of all others to be his mouthpiece, he 
\par gives us in the following words: "People have never asked 
\par me, as they should have done, what the name Zarathustra 
\par precisely means in my mouth, in the mouth of the first Im- 
\par moralist; for what distinguishes that philosopher from all 
\par others in the past is the very fact that he was exactly the reverse 
\par of an immoralist. Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle 
\par between good and evil the essential wheel in the working of 
\par things. The translation of morality into the metaphysical, as 
\par force, cause, end in itself, was bis work. But the very question 
\par suggests its own answer. Zarathustra created the most porten 
\par tous error, morality, consequently he should also be the first to 
\par perceive that error, not only because he has had longer and 
\par greater experience of the subject than any other thinker all 
\par history is the experimental refutation of the theory of the so- 
\par called moral order of things: the more important point is 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par INTRODUCTION XXlli 
\par 
\par that Zarathustra was more truthful than any other thinker. In 
\par his teaching alone do we meet with truthfulness upheld as the 
\par highest virtue i.e.: the reverse of the cowardice of the ideal 
\par ist who flees from reality. Zarathustra had more courage in his 
\par body than any other thinker before or after him. To tell the / 
\par truth and to aim straight: that is the first Persian virtue. Am I ^ 
\par understood? . . . The overcoming of morality through itself 
\par through truthfulness, the overcoming of the moralist 
\par through his opposite through me : that is what the name *&gt; 
\par Zarathustra means in my mouth."

\par ^arathustra s Prologue 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHEN Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and 
\par the lake of his home, and went into the mountains. There he 
\par enjoyed his spirit and his solitude, and for ten years did not 
\par weary of it. But at last his heart changed, and rising one 
\par morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the sun, and 
\par spake thus unto it: 
\par 
\par Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst 
\par not those for whom thou shinest! 
\par 
\par For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou 
\par wouldsthave wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not 
\par been for me, mine eagle, and my serpent. 
\par 
\par But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine 
\par overflow, and blessed thee for it. 
\par 
\par Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gath 
\par ered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it. 
\par 
\par I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once 
\par more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their 
\par riches. 
\par 
\par Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in 
\par the evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light 
\par also to the nether- world, thou exuberant star! 
\par 
\par Like thee must I go down, as men say, to whom I shall 
\par descend. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 4 ZARATHUSTRAS PROLOGUE 
\par 
\par Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the 
\par greatest happiness without envy! 
\par 
\par Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may 
\par flow golden out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of: 
\par thy bliss! 
\par 
\par Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra 
\par is again going to be a man. 
\par 
\par Thus began Zarathustra s down-going. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Zarathustra went down the mountain alone, no one meeting 
\par him. When he entered the forest, however, there suddenly 
\par stood before him an old man, who had left his holy cot to seek 
\par roots. And thus spake the old man to Zarathustra: 
\par 
\par "No stranger to me is this wanderer: many years ago passed 
\par he by. Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered. 
\par 
\par Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains: wilt 
\par thou now carry thy fire into the valleys? Fearest thou not the 
\par incendiary s doom? 
\par 
\par Yea, I recognize Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loath 
\par ing lurketh about his mouth. Goeth he not along like a 
\par dancer? 
\par 
\par Altered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarathustra become; an 
\par awakened one is Zarathustra: what wilt thou do in the land of 
\par the sleepers? 
\par 
\par As in the sea hast thou lived in solitude, and it hath borne 
\par thee up. Alas, wilt thou now go ashore? Alas, wilt thou again 
\par drag thy body thyself?" 
\par 
\par Zarathustra answered: "I love mankind." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ZARATHUSTRAS PROLOGUE 5 
\par 
\par "Why," said the saint, "did I go into the forest and the 
\par desert? Was it not because I loved men far too well? 
\par 
\par Now I love God: men, I do not love. Man is a thing too 
\par imperfect for me. Love to man would be fatal to me." 
\par 
\par Zarathustra answered: "What spake I of love! I am bring 
\par ing gifts unto men." 
\par 
\par "Give them nothing," said the saint. "Take rather part of 
\par their load, and carry it along with them that will be most 
\par agreeable unto them: if only it be agreeable unto thee! 
\par 
\par If, however, thou wilt give unto them, give them no more 
\par than an alms, and let them also beg for it!" 
\par 
\par "No," replied Zarathustra, "I give no alms. I am not poor 
\par enough for that." 
\par 
\par The saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spake thus: "Then 
\par see to it that they accept thy treasures! They are distrustful of 
\par anchorites, and do not believe that we come with gifts. 
\par 
\par The fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their 
\par streets. And just as at night, when they are in bed and hear a 
\par man abroad long before sunrise, so they ask themselves con 
\par cerning us: Where goeth the thief? 
\par 
\par Go not to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the ani 
\par mals! Why not be like me a bear amongst bears, a bird 
\par amongst birds?" 
\par 
\par "And what doeth the saint in the forest?" asked Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par The saint answered: "I make hymns and sing them; and in 
\par making hymns I laugh and weep and mumble: thus do I praise 
\par God. 
\par 
\par With singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling do I praise 
\par the God who is my God. But what dost thou bring us as a gift?" 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the 
\par saint and said: "What should I have to give thee! Let me rather 
\par hurry hence lest I take aught away from thee!" And thus 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 6 ZAJATHUSTRAS PROLOGUE 
\par 
\par they parted from one another, the old man and Zarathustra, 
\par laughing like schoolboys. 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: 
\par "Could it be possible! This old saint in the forest hath not yet 
\par heard of it, that God is dead!" 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which ad 
\par joineth the forest, he found many people assembled in the 
\par market-place; for it had been announced that a rope-dancer 
\par would give a performance. And Zarathustra spake thus unto 
\par the people: 
\par 
\par / teach you the Superman. Man is something that is to be 
\par surpassed. What have ye done to surpass man? 
\par 
\par All beings hitherto have created something beyond them 
\par selves : and ye want to be the ebb of that great tide, and would 
\par rather go back to the beast than surpass man? 
\par 
\par What is the ape to man? A laughing-stock, a thing of shame. 
\par And just the same shall man be to the Superman: a laughing 
\par stock, a thing of shame. 
\par 
\par Ye have made your way from the worm to man, and much 
\par within you is still worm. Once were ye apes, and even yet man 
\par is more of an ape than any of the apes. 
\par 
\par Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid 
\par of plant and phantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or 
\par plants? 
\par 
\par Lo, i reach you the Superman! 
\par 
\par The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will 
\par say: The Superman shall be the meaning of the earth! 
\par 
\par I conjure you, my brethren, remain true to the earth, and be- 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ZARATHUSTRAS PROLLV&UM ) 
\par 
\par lieve not those who speak unto you of superearthly hopes! 
\par Poisoners are they, whether they know it or not. 
\par 
\par Despisers of life are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones 
\par themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so away with them! 
\par 
\par Once blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy; 
\par but God died, and therewith also those blasphemers. To blas 
\par pheme the earth is now the dreadf ulest sin, and to rate the heart 
\par of the unknowable higher than the meaning of the earth! 
\par 
\par Once the soul looked contemptuously on the body, and then 
\par that contempt was the supreme thing: the soul wished the 
\par body meagre, ghastly, and famished. Thus it (:hought to escape 
\par from the body and the earth. 
\par 
\par Oh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and famished; and 
\par cruelty was the delight of that soul! 
\par 
\par But ye, also, my brethren, tell me: What doth your body say 
\par about your soul? Is your soul not poverty arid pollution and 
\par wretched self-complacency? 
\par 
\par Verily, a polluted stream is man. One must be a sea, to re 
\par ceive a polluted stream without becoming impure. 
\par 
\par Lo, I teach you the Superman: he is that sea; in him can your 
\par great contempt be submerged. 
\par 
\par What is the greatest thing ye can experience? It is the hour 
\par of great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness be- 
\par cometh loathsome unto you, and so also your reason and virtue. 
\par 
\par The hour when ye say: "What good is my happiness! It is 
\par poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency. But my 
\par happiness should justify existence itself!" 
\par 
\par The hour when ye say: "What good is my reason! Doth it 
\par long for knowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and 
\par pollution ano wretched self-complacency!" 
\par 
\par The hour when ye say: "What good is my virtue! As yet it 
\par hath no* 1 made me passionate. How weary I am of my good 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 8 ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 
\par 
\par and my bad! It is all poverty and pollution and wretched self- 
\par complacency!" 
\par 
\par The hour when ye say: "What good is my justice! I do not 
\par see that I am fervour and fuel. The just, however, are fervour 
\par and fuel!" 
\par 
\par The hour when we say: "What good is my pity! Is not pity 
\par the cross on which he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity 
\par is not a crucifixion." 
\par 
\par Have ye ever spoken thus? Have ye ever cried thus? Ah! 
\par would that I had heard you crying thus! 
\par 
\par It is not your sin it is your self-satisfaction that crieth unto 
\par heaven; your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven! 
\par 
\par Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where 
\par is the frenzy with which ye should be inoculated? 
\par 
\par Lo, I teach you the Superman: he is that lightning, he is that 
\par frenzy! 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra had thus spoken, one of the people called 
\par out: "We have now heard enough of the rope-dancer; it is 
\par time now for us to see him!" And all the people laughed at 
\par Zarathustra. But the rope-dancer, who thought the words ap 
\par plied to mm. began his performance. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Zarathustra, however, looked at the people and wondered. 
\par Then he spake thus: 
\par 
\par Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Super 
\par man a rope over an abyss. 
\par 
\par A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous 
\par looking-back, a dangerous trembling and halting. 
\par 
\par What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal; 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 9 
\par 
\par what is lovable in man is that he is an over- going and a down- 
\par going. 
\par 
\par I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, 
\par for they are the over-goers. 
\par 
\par I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, 
\par and arrows of longing for the other shore. 
\par 
\par I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars 
\par for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to 
\par the earth, that the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive. 
\par 
\par I love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know 
\par in order that the Superman may hereafter live. Thus seeketh he 
\par his own down-going. 
\par 
\par I love him who laboureth and inventeth, that he may build 
\par the house for the Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, 
\par and plant: for thus seeketh he his own down-going. 
\par 
\par I love him who loveth his virtue: for virtue is the will to 
\par down-going, and an arrow of longing. 
\par 
\par I love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but 
\par wanteth to be wholly the spirit of his virtue: thus walketh he 
\par as spirit over the bridge. 
\par 
\par I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny: 
\par thus, for the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live 
\par no more. 
\par 
\par I love him who desireth not too many virtues. One virtue is 
\par more of a virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one s 
\par destiny to cling to. 
\par 
\par I love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks ana 
\par doth not give back: for he always bestoweth, and desireth not 
\par to keep for himself. 
\par 
\par 1 love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, 
\par and who then asketh: "Am I a dishonest player?" for he is 
\par willing to succumb. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par io ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 
\par 
\par I love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his 
\par deeds, and always doeth more than he promiseth: for he 
\par seeketh his own down-going. 
\par 
\par I love him who justified! the future ones, and redeemeth 
\par the past ones : for he is willing to succumb through the present 
\par ones. 
\par 
\par I love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his 
\par God: for he must succumb through the wrath of his God. 
\par 
\par I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and 
\par may succumb through a small matter: thus goeth he willingly 
\par over the bridge. 
\par 
\par I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth him 
\par self, and all things are in him : thus all things become his down- 
\par going. 
\par 
\par I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart: thus is his 
\par head only ths bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth 
\par his down-going. 
\par 
\par I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of 
\par the dark cloud that lowereth over man : they herald the coming 
\par of the lightning, and succumb as heralds. 
\par 
\par Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of 
\par the cloud: the lightning, however, is the Superman. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked 
\par at the people, and was silent. "There they stand," said he to his 
\par heart; "there they laugh: they understand me not; I am not the 
\par mouth for these ears. 
\par 
\par Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear 
\par with their eyes? Must one clatter like kettledrums arid peni- 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par iARATHUSTRA s PROLOGUE H 
\par 
\par tential preachers? Or do they only believe the stamiuerer? 
\par 
\par They have something whereof they are proud. What do they 
\par call it, that which maketh them proud? Culture, they call it; il 
\par distinguished! them from the goatherds. 
\par 
\par They dislike, therefore, to hear of contempt of themselves, 
\par So I will appeal to their pride. 
\par 
\par I will speak unto them of tlie most contemptible thing! 
\par that, however, is the last man!" 
\par 
\par And thus spake Zarathustra unto the people: 
\par 
\par It is time for man to fix his goal. It is time for man to plant 
\par the germ of his highest hope. 
\par 
\par Still is his soil rich enough for it. But that soil will one day 
\par be poor and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be 
\par able to grow thereon. 
\par 
\par Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch 
\par the arrow of his longing beyond man and the string of his 
\par bow will have unlearned to whizz! 
\par 
\par I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to 
\par a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you. 
\par 
\par Alas! There cometh the time when man will no longer give 
\par birth to any star. Alas! There cometh the time of the most 
\par despicable man, who can no longer despise himself. 
\par 
\par Lo! I show you the last man. 
\par 
\par "What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is 
\par a star?" so asketh the last man and blinketh. 
\par 
\par The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth 
\par the last man who maketh everything small. His species is in 
\par eradicable like that of the ground-flea; the last man liveth 
\par longest. 
\par 
\par "We liave discovered happiness" say the last men, and 
\par blink thereby. 
\par 
\par They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for thef 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 12 ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 
\par 
\par need warmth. One still loveth one s neighbour and rubbeth 
\par against him; for one needeth warmth. 
\par 
\par Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful: they 
\par walk warily. He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or 
\par men! 
\par 
\par A little poison now and then: that maketh pleasant dreams. 
\par And much poison at last for a pleasant death. 
\par 
\par One still worketh, for work is a pastime. But one is careful 
\par lest the pastime should hurt one. 
\par 
\par One no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burden 
\par some. Who still wanteth to rule? Who stili wanteth to obey? 
\par Both are too burdensome. 
\par 
\par No shepherd, and one herd! Everyone wanteth the same; 
\par everyone is equal : he who hath other sentiments goeth volun 
\par tarily into the madhouse. 
\par 
\par "Formerly all the world was insane," say the subtlest of 
\par them, and blink thereby. 
\par 
\par They are clever and know all that hath happened: so there 
\par is no end to their raillery. People still fall out, but are soon 
\par reconciled otherwise it spoileth their stomachs. 
\par 
\par They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little 
\par pleasures for the night, but they have a regard for health. 
\par 
\par "We have discovered happiness," say the last men, and 
\par blink thereby. 
\par 
\par And here ended the first discourse of Zarathustra, which is 
\par also called "The Prologue", for at this point the shouting and 
\par mirth of the multitude interrupted him. "Give us this last man, 
\par O Zarathustra," they called out "make us into these last 
\par men! Then will we make thee a present of the Superman!" 
\par And all the people exulted and smacked their lips. Zarathustra, 
\par however, turned sad, and said to his heart : 
\par 
\par They understand me not: I am not the mouth for these ears. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 13 
\par 
\par Toe long, perhaps, have I lived in the mountains; too much 
\par have I hearkened unto the brooks and trees: now do I speak 
\par unto them as unto the goatherds. 
\par 
\par Calm is my soul, and clear, like the mountains in the morn 
\par ing. But they think me cold, and a mocker with terrible jests. 
\par 
\par And now do they look at me and laugh: and while they 
\par laugh they hate me too. There is ice in their laughter." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 6 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Then, however, something happened which made every 
\par mouth mute and every eye fixed. In the meantime, of course, 
\par the rope-dancer had commenced his performance: he had come 
\par out at a little door, and was going along the rope which was 
\par stretched between two towers, so that it hung above the market 
\par place and the people. When he was just midway across, the 
\par little door opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow like 
\par a buffoon sprang out, and went rapidly after the first one. "Go 
\par on, halt-foot," cried his frightful voice, "go on, lazy-bones, 
\par interloper, sallow- face! lest I tickle thee with my heel! What 
\par dost thou here between the towers? In the tower is the place 
\par for thee, thou shouldst be locked up; to one better than thyself 
\par thou blockest the way!" And with every word he came nearer 
\par and nearer the first one. When, however, he was but a step 
\par behind, there happened the frightful thing which made every 
\par mouth mute and every eye fixed he uttered a yell like a devil, 
\par and jumped over the other who was in his way. The latter, 
\par however, when he thus saw his rival triumph, lost at the same 
\par time his head and his footing on the rope; he threw his pole 
\par away, and shot downward faster than it, like an eddy of arms 
\par and legs, into the depth. The market-place and the people were 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 14 ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 
\par 
\par like the sea when the storm cometh on: they all flew apart and 
\par in disorder, especially where the body was about to fall. 
\par 
\par Zarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside 
\par him fell the body, badly injured and disfigured, but not yet 
\par dead. After a while consciousness returned to the shattered 
\par man, and he saw Zarathustra kneeling beside him. "What art 
\par thou doing there?" said he at last, "I knew long ago that the 
\par devil would trip me up. Now he draggeth me to hell: wilt thou 
\par prevent him?" 
\par 
\par "On mine honour, my friend," answered Zarathustra, 
\par "there is nothing of all that whereof thou speakest: there is no 
\par devil and no hell. Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy 
\par body; fear, therefore, nothing any more!" 
\par 
\par The man looked up distrustfully. "If thou speakest the 
\par truth," said he, "I lose nothing when I lose my life. J am not 
\par much more than an animal which hath been taught to dance by 
\par blows and scanty fare." 
\par 
\par "Not at all," said Zarathustra, "thou hast made danger thy 
\par calling; therein there is nothing contemptible. Now thou 
\par perishest by thy calling: therefore will I bury thee with mine 
\par own hands." 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply 
\par further; but he moved his hand as if he sought the hand of 
\par Zarathustra in gratitude. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Meanwhile the evening came on, and the market-place 
\par veiled itself in gloom. Then the people dispersed, for even 
\par curiosity and terror become fatigued. Zarathustra, however, 
\par rtill sat beside the dead man on the ground, absorbed in 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 15 
\par 
\par thought: so he forgot the time. But at last it became night, and 
\par a cold wind blew upon the lonely one. Then arose Zarathustra 
\par and said to his heart: 
\par 
\par Verily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made to-day! It is 
\par not a man he hath caught, but a corpse. 
\par 
\par Sombre is human life, and as yet without meaning: a buffoon 
\par may be fateful to it. 
\par 
\par I want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the 
\par Superman, the lightning out of the dark cloud man. 
\par 
\par But still am I far from them, and my sense speaketh not unto 
\par their sense. To men I am still something between a fool and 
\par a corpse. 
\par 
\par Gloomy is the night, gloomy are the ways of Zarathustra. 
\par Come, thou cold and stiff companion! I carry thee to the place 
\par where I shall bury thee with mine own hands. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 8 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he put the 
\par corpse upon his shoulders and set out on his way. Yet had he 
\par not gone a hundred steps, when there stole a man up to him 
\par and whispered in his ear and lo! he that spake was the buf 
\par foon from the tower. "Leave this town, O Zarathustra," said 
\par he, "there are too many here who hate thee. The good and just 
\par hate thee, and call thee their enemy and despiser; the believers 
\par in the orthodox belief hate thee, and call thee a danger to the 
\par multitude. It was thy good fortune to be laughed at: and verily 
\par thou spakest like a buffoon. It was thy good fortune to associate 
\par with the dead dog; by so humiliating thyself thou hast saved 
\par thy life today. Depart, however, from this town, or tomor 
\par row I shall jump over thee, a living man over a dead one." And 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 16 ZARATHUSTRA S PROLOGUE 
\par 
\par when he had said this, the buffoon vanished; Zarathustra, how 
\par ever, went on through the dark streets. 
\par 
\par At the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him: they 
\par shone their torch on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra. 
\par they sorely derided him. "Zarathustra is carrying away the dead 
\par dog: a fine thing tnat Zarathustra hath turned a- grave-digger! 
\par For our hands are too cleanly for that roast. Will Zarathustra 
\par steal the bite from the devil? Well then, good luck to the re 
\par past! If only the devil is not a better thief than Zarathustra! 
\par he will steal them both, he will eat them both!" And they 
\par laughed among themselves, and put their heads together. 
\par 
\par Zarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way. 
\par When he had gone on for two hours, past forests and swamps, 
\par he had heard too much of the hungry howling of the wolves, 
\par and he himself became hungry. So he halted at a lonely house 
\par in which a light was burning. 
\par 
\par "Hunger attacketh me," said Zarathustra, "like a robber. 
\par Among forests and swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late 
\par in the night. 
\par 
\par "Strange humours hath my hunger. Often it cometh to me 
\par only after a repast, and all day it hath failed to come: where 
\par hath it been?" 
\par 
\par And thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the 
\par house. An old man appeared, who carried a light, and asked : 
\par "Who cometh unto me and my bad sleep?" 
\par 
\par "A living man and a dead one," said Zarathustra. "Give me 
\par something to eat and drink, I forgot it during the day. He that 
\par feedeth the hungry refresheth his own soul, saith wisdom." 
\par 
\par The old man withdrew, but came back immediately and 
\par offered Zarathustra bread and wine. "A bad country for the 
\par hungry," said he; "that is why I live here. Animal and man 
\par come unto me, the anchorite. But bid thy companion eat arxi

\par

\par 
\par drink also, he is wearier than thou." Zarathustra answered: 
\par "My companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to persuade him 
\par to eat." "That doth not concern me," said the old man sullenly; 
\par "he that knocketh at my door must take what I offer him. Eat, 
\par and fare ye well!" 
\par 
\par Thereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trust 
\par ing to the path and the light of the stars: for he was an experi 
\par enced night-walker, and liked to look into the face of all thai 
\par slept. When the morning dawned, however, Zarathustra found 
\par himself in a thick forest, and no path was any longer visible. 
\par He then put the dead man in a hollow tree at his head for he 
\par wanted to protect him from the wolves and laid himself 
\par down on the ground and moss. And immediately he fell asleep, 
\par tired in body, but with a tranquil soul. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Long slept Zarathustra; and not only the rosy dawn passed 
\par over his head, but also the morning. At last, however, his eyes 
\par opened, and amazedly he gazed into the forest and the stillness, 
\par amazedly he gazed into himself. Then he arose quickly, like a 
\par seafarer who all at once seeth the land; and he shouted for joy: 
\par for he saw a new truth. And he spake thus to his heart: 
\par 
\par A light hath dawned upon me: I need companions living 
\par ones; not dead companions and corpses, which I carry with me 
\par where I will. 
\par 
\par But I need living companions, who will follow me because 
\par they want to follow themselves and to the place where I will. 
\par A light hath dawned upon me. Not to the people is Zarathustra 
\par to speak, but to companions! Zarathustra shall not be the herd s 
\par herdsman and hound! 
\par 
\par 
\par

\par 
\par To allure many from the herd for that purpose have I 
\par come. The people and the herd must be angry with me: a rob 
\par ber shall Zarathustra be called by the herdsmen. 
\par 
\par Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just. 
\par Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the believers in the 
\par orthodox belief. 
\par 
\par Behold the good and just! Whom do they hate most? Him

\par

\par 
\par And thou, my first companion, rest in peace! Well have I 
\par buried thee in thy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the 
\par wolves. 
\par 
\par But I part from thee; the time hath arrived. Twixt rosy

\par 
\par I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger.

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par This had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at 
\par noon-tide. Then he looked inquiringly aloft, for he heard 
\par above him the sharp call of a bird. And behold! An eagle swept 
\par through the air in wide circles, and on it hung a serpent, not 
\par like a prey, but like a friend : for it kept itself coiled round the

\par 
\par "They are mine animals," said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in 
\par his heart. 
\par 
\par "The proudest animal under the sun, and the wisest animal

\par 
\par More dangerous have I found it among men than among

\par 
\par When Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words 
\par of the saint in the forest. Then he sighed and spake thus to 
\par his heart:

\par /. The Three Metamoi phases 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THREE metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: now 
\par the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at 
\par last a child. 
\par 
\par Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load- 
\par bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth : for the heavy and 
\par the heaviest longeth its strength. 
\par 
\par What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then 
\par kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden. 
\par 
\par What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bear 
\par ing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength. 
\par 
\par Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one s 
\par pride? To exhibit one s folly in order to mock at one s wisdom? 
\par 
\par Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its 
\par triumph? To ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter? 
\par 
\par Or is it this : To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, 
\par and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul? 
\par 
\par Or is it this : To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make 
\par friends of the deaf, who never hear thy requests? 
\par 
\par Or is it this : To go into foul water when it is the water of 
\par truth, and not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads? 
\par 
\par Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one s 
\par hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us? 
\par 
\par All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon 
\par itself: and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into 
\par the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness. 
\par 
\par 23 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 24 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second meta 
\par morphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it 
\par capture, and lordship in its own wilderness. 
\par 
\par Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to 
\par its last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon. 
\par 
\par What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer in 
\par clined to call Lord and God? "Thou-shalt," is the great dragon 
\par called. But the spirit of the lion saith, "I will." 
\par 
\par "Thou-shalt," lieth in its path, sparkling with gold a scale- 
\par covered beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, "Thou 
\par shalt!" 
\par 
\par The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and 
\par thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: "All the values of 
\par things glitter on me. 
\par 
\par All values have already been created, and all created values 
\par do I represent. Verily, there shall be no I will any more." 
\par Thus speaketh the dragon. 
\par 
\par My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the 
\par spirit? Why sufnceth not the beast of burden, which re- 
\par nounceth and is reverent? 
\par 
\par To create new values that, even the lion cannot yet accom 
\par plish : but to create itself freedom for new creating that can 
\par the might of the lion do. 
\par 
\par To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto 
\par duty: for that, my brethren, there is need of the lion. 
\par 
\par To assume the ride to new values that is the most formi 
\par dable assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, 
\par unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey. 
\par 
\par As its holiest, it once loved "Thou-shalt": now is it forced 
\par to find illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that 
\par it may capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for 
\par Hhiis cant^re,

\par 
\par But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which eveo 
\par the lion could not do? Why hath the preying lion still to be 
\par c.ome a child? 
\par 
\par Innocence is the child, and f orgetf ulness, a new beginning, 
\par a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea. 
\par 
\par Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed 
\par i holy Yea unto life: its own will, willeth now the spirit; his 
\par own world winneth the world s outcast. 
\par 
\par Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: 
\par how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion 
\par at last a child. 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the 
\par town which is called The Pied Cow. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 2. The Academic Chairs of Virtue 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par PEOPLE commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who 
\par could discourse well about sleep and virtue: greatly was he 
\par honoured and rewarded for it, and all the youths sat before 
\par his chair. To him went Zarathustra, and sat among the youths 
\par before his chair. And thus spake the wise man: 
\par 
\par Respect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first 
\par thing! And to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and 
\par keep awake at night! 
\par 
\par Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always 
\par steal eth softly through the night. Immodest, however, is the 
\par night-watchman; immodestly he carrieth his horn. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 26 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par No small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose 
\par to keep awake all day. 
\par 
\par Ten times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth 
\par wholesome weariness, and is poppy to the soul. 
\par 
\par Ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for over 
\par coming is bitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled. 
\par 
\par Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt 
\par thou seek truth during the night, and thy soul will have been 
\par hungry. 
\par 
\par Ten times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; 
\par otherwise thy stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb 
\par thee in the night. 
\par 
\par Few people know it, but one must have all the virtues in 
\par order to sleep well. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit 
\par adultery? 
\par 
\par Shall I covet my neighbour s maidservant? All that would ill 
\par accord with good sleep. 
\par 
\par And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing 
\par needful: to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right 
\par time. 
\par 
\par That they may not quarrel with one another, the good 
\par females! And about thee, thou unhappy one! 
\par 
\par Peace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. 
\par And peace also with thy neighbour s devil! Otherwise it will 
\par haunt thee in the night. 
\par 
\par Honour to the government, and obedience, and 1 also to the 
\par crooked government! So desireth good sleep. How can 1 help 
\par it, if power liketh to walk on crooked legs? 
\par 
\par He who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall 
\par always be for ine the best shepherd: so doth it accord with 
\par good sleep. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE 2J 
\par 
\par Many honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite 
\par the spleen. But it is bad sleeping without a good name and a 
\par little treasure. 
\par 
\par A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but 
\par they must come and go at the right time. So doth it accord 
\par with good sleep. 
\par 
\par Well, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote 
\par sleep. Blessed are they, especially if one always give in to them. 
\par 
\par Thus passeth the day unto the virtuous. When night cometh, 
\par then take I good care not to summon sleep. It disliketh to be 
\par summoned sleep, the lord of the virtues! 
\par 
\par But I think of what I have done and thought during the day. 
\par Thus ruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy 
\par ten overcomings? 
\par 
\par And what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, 
\par and the ten laughters with which my heart enjoyed itself? 
\par 
\par Thus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it over- 
\par taketh me all at once sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the 
\par virtues. 
\par 
\par Sleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy. Sleep 
\par toucheth my mouth, and it remaineth open. 
\par 
\par Verily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of 
\par thieves, and stealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then 
\par stand, like this academic chair. 
\par 
\par But not much longer do I then stand : I already lie. 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he 
\par laughed in his heart: for thereby had a light dawned upon him 
\par And thus spake he to his heart: 
\par 
\par A fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but 
\par I believe he knoweth well how to sleep. 
\par 
\par Happy even is he who liveth near this wise man! Such sleep 
\par s rontao-ious even th rou r crh_ a thick wall it is contagious.

\par 
\par A magic resideth even in his academic chair. And not in vain 
\par did the youths sit before the preacher of virtue. 
\par 
\par His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And 
\par verily, if life had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this 
\par would be the desirablest nonsense for me also. 
\par 
\par Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else 
\par when they sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought 
\par for themselves, and poppy-head virtues to promote it! 
\par 
\par To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom 
\par was sleep without dreams: they knew no higher significance 
\par of life. 
\par 
\par Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher 
\par of virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past. 
\par And not much longer do they stand : there they already lie. 
\par 
\par Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to 
\par sleep. 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par j. Backworldsmen 
\par 
\par ONCE on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, 
\par like all backworldsmen. The work of a suffering and tortured 
\par God, did the world then seem to me. 
\par 
\par The dream and diction of a God, did the world then 
\par seem to me; coloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely 
\par dissatisfied one. 
\par 
\par Good and evil, and joy and woe, and I and thou coloured 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par BACKWORLDSMEN 29 
\par 
\par vapours did they seem to me before creative eyes. The creator 
\par wished to look away from himself, thereupon he created the 
\par world, 
\par 
\par Intoxica^ ng joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his 
\par suffering and forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self -forget 
\par ting, did the world once seem to me. 
\par 
\par This world, the eternally imperfect, an eternal contradic 
\par tion s image and imperfect image an intoxicating joy to its 
\par imperfect creator: thus did the world once seem to me. 
\par 
\par Thus, once on a time, did I also cast my fancy beyond man, 
\par like all backworldsmen. Beyond man, forsooth? 
\par 
\par Ah, ye brethren, that God whom I created was human work 
\par and human madness, like all the gods! 
\par 
\par A man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego. 
\par Out of mine own ashes and glow it came unto me, that phan 
\par tom. And verily, it came not unto me from the beyond! 
\par 
\par What happened, my brethren? I surpassed myself, the suf 
\par fering one; I carried mine own ashes to the mountain; a 
\par brighter flame I contrived for myself. And lo! Thereupon the 
\par phantom withdrew from me! 
\par 
\par To me the convalescent would it now be suffering and 
\par torment to believe in such phantoms : suffering would it now be 
\par to me, and humiliation. Thus speak I to backworldsmen. 
\par 
\par Suffering was it, and impotence that created all back- 
\par worlds; and the short madness of happiness, which only the 
\par greatest sufferer experienced.!. 
\par 
\par Weariness, which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one 
\par leap, with a death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling 
\par even to will any longer: that created all gods and backworlds. 
\par 
\par Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despairea 
\par of the body it groped with the Angers or the infatuated spirit 
\par at the ultimate walls. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 30 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of 
\par the earth it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it. 
\par 
\par And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its 
\par head and not with its head only into "the other world." 
\par 
\par But that "other world" is well concealed from man, that 
\par dehumanised, inhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and 
\par the bowels of existence do not speak unto man, except as man. 
\par 
\par Verily, it is difficult to prove all being, and hard to make it 
\par speak. Tell me, ye brethren, is not the strangest of all things 
\par best proved? .- 
\par 
\par Yea, this ego, with its contradiction and perplexity, speaketh 
\par most uprightly of its being this creating, willing, evaluing 
\par ego, which is the measure and value of things. 
\par 
\par And this most upright existence, the ego it speaketh of the 
\par body, and still implieth the body, even when it museth and 
\par raveth and fluttereth with broken wings. 
\par 
\par Always more uprightly learneth it to speak, the ego; and 
\par the more it learneth, the more doth it find titles, and honours 
\par for the body and the earth. 
\par 
\par A new pride taught me mine ego, and that teach I unto 
\par men: no longer to thrust one s head into the sand of celestial 
\par things, but to carry it freely, a terrestrial head, which giveth 
\par meaning to the earth! 
\par 
\par A new will teach I unto men: to choose that path which 
\par man hath followed blindly, and to approve of it and no 
\par longer to slink aside from it, like the sick and perishing! 
\par 
\par The sick and perishing it was they who despised the body 
\par and the earth, and invented the heavenly world, and the re 
\par deeming blood-drops; but even those sweet and sad poisons 
\par they borrowed from the body and the earth! 
\par 
\par From their misery they sought escape, and the stars wer* 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par BACKWORLDSMEN 3! 
\par 
\par too remote for them. Then they sighed: "O that there were 
\par heavenly paths by which to steal into another existence and 
\par into happiness!" Then they contrived for themselves their by- 
\par paths and bloody draughts! 
\par 
\par Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now 
\par fancied themselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to 
\par what did they owe the convulsion and rapture of their trans 
\par port? To their body and this earth. 
\par 
\par Gentle is Zarathustra to the sickly. Verily, he is not indig 
\par nant at their modes of consolation and ingratitude. May they 
\par become convalescents and overcomers, and create higher bodies 
\par for themselves! 
\par 
\par Neither is Zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who 
\par looketh tenderly on his delusions, and at midnight stealeth 
\par round the grave of his God; but sickness and a sick frame re 
\par main even in his tears. 
\par 
\par Many sickly ones have there always been among those who 
\par muse, and languish for God; violently they hate the discern 
\par ing ones, and the latest of virtues, which is uprightness. 
\par 
\par Backward they always gaze toward dark ages: then, indeed, 
\par were delusion and faith something different. Raving of the 
\par reason was likeness to God, and doubt was sin. 
\par 
\par Too well do I know those godlike ones : they insist on being 
\par believed in, and that doubt is sin. Too well, also, do I know 
\par what they themselves most believe in. 
\par 
\par Verily, not in backworlds and redeeming blood-drops: but 
\par in the body do they also believe most; and their own body is 
\par for them the thing-in-itself . 
\par 
\par But it is a sickly thing to them, and gladly would they get 
\par out of their skin. Therefore hearken they to the preachers of 
\par death, and themselves preach backworlds.

\par thy body, it is thy body. 
\par 
\par There is more sagacity in thy body than in thy best wis 
\par dom. And who then knoweth why thy body requireth just thy 
\par best wisdom? 
\par 
\par Thy Self laugheth at thine ego, and its proud prancings. 
\par "What are these prancings and flights of thought unto me?" 
\par it saith to itself. "A by-way to my purpose. I am the leading- 
\par string of the ego, and the prompter of its notions." 
\par 
\par The Self saith unto the ego: "Feel pain!" And thereupon it 
\par suffereth, and thinketh how it may put an end thereto and for 
\par that very purpose it is meant to think. 
\par 
\par The Self saith unto the ego: "Feel pleasure!" Thereupon it 
\par rejoiceth, and thinketh how it may ofttimes rejoice and for 
\par that very purpose it is meant to think. 
\par 
\par To the despisers of the body will I speak a word. That they 
\par despise is caused by their esteem. What is it that created 
\par esteeming and despising and worth and will? 
\par 
\par The creating Self created for itself esteeming and despising, 
\par it created for itself joy and woe. The creating body created for 
\par itself spirit, as a hand to its will. 
\par 
\par Even in your folly and despising ye each serve your Self, 
\par ye despisers of the body. I tell you, your very Self wanteth 
\par to die, and turneth away from life. 
\par 
\par No longer can your Self do that which it desireth most:

\par 
\par 34 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par create beyond itself. That is what it desireth most; that is all 
\par its fervour. 
\par 
\par But it is now too late to do so: so your Self wisheth to 
\par succumb, ye despisers of the body. 
\par 
\par To succumb so wisheth your Self; and therefore have ye 
\par become despisers of the body. For ye can no longer create be 
\par yond yourselves. 
\par 
\par And therefore are ye now angry with life and with the earth. 
\par And unconscious envy is in the sidelong look of your contempt. 
\par 
\par I go not your way, ye despisers of the body! Ye are no

\par 
\par MY BROTHER, when thou hast a virtue, and it is thine own 
\par virtue, thou hast it in common with no one. 
\par 
\par To be sure, thou wouldst call it by name and caress it; thou 
\par wouldst pull its ears and amuse thyself with it. 
\par 
\par And lo! Then hast thou its name in common with the 
\par people, and hast become one of the people and the herd with 
\par thy virtue! 
\par 
\par Better for thee to say: "Ineffable is it, and nameless, that 
\par which is pain and sweetness to my soul, and also the hunger of 
\par my bowels." 
\par 
\par Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and 
\par if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par JOYS AND PASSIONS 35 
\par 
\par Thus speak and stammer: "That is my good, that do I love, 
\par thus doth it please me entirely, thus only do 1 desire the good. 
\par 
\par Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law 
\par or a human need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for 
\par me to superearths and paradises, 
\par 
\par An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is 
\par therein, and the least everyday wisdom. 
\par 
\par But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and 
\par cherish it now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs." 
\par 
\par Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue. 
\par 
\par Once hadst thou passions and calledst them evil. But no\\fc 
\par hast thou only thy virtues: they grew out of thy passions. 
\par 
\par Thou implantedst thy highest aim into the heart of those 
\par passions: then became they thy virtues and joys. 
\par 
\par And though thou wert of the race of the hot- tempered, or 
\par of the voluptuous, or of the fanatical, or the vindictive; 
\par 
\par All thy passions in the end became virtues, and all thy devils 
\par angels. 
\par 
\par Once hadst thou wild dogs in thy cellar: but they changed 
\par at last into birds and charming songstresses. 
\par 
\par Out of thy poisons brewedst thou balsam for thyself; thy 
\par cow, affliction, milkedst thou now drinketh thou the sweet 
\par milk of her udder. 
\par 
\par And nothing evil groweth in thee any longer, unless it be 
\par the evil that groweth out of the conflict of thy virtues. 
\par 
\par My brother, if thou be fortunate, then wilt thou have one 
\par virtue and no more: thus goest thou easier over the bridge. 
\par 
\par Illustrious is it to have many virtues, but a hard lot; and 
\par many a one hath gone into the wilderness and killed himself 
\par because he was weary of being the battle and battlefield ol 
\par virtues. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ^6 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par My brother, are war and battle evil? Necessary, however, is 
\par the evil; necessary are the envy and the distrust and the back 
\par biting among the virtues. 
\par 
\par Lo! how each of thy virtues is covetous of the highest place; 
\par it wanteth thy whole spirit to be its herald, it wanteth thy whole 
\par power, in wrath, hatred, and love. 
\par 
\par Jealous is every virtue of the others, and a dreadful thing is 
\par jealousy. Even virtues may succumb by jealousy. 
\par 
\par He whom the flame of jealousy encompasseth, turneth at 
\par last, like the scorpion, the poisoned sting against himself. 
\par 
\par Ah! my brother, hast thou never seen a virtue backbite and 
\par stab itself? 
\par 
\par Man is something that hath to be surpassed : and therefore 
\par shalt thou love thy virtues, for thou wilt succumb by them.

\par 6. The Pale Criminal 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par YE DO not mean to slay, ye judges and sacrificers, until the 
\par animal hath bowed its head? Lo! the pale criminal hath bowed 
\par his head : out of his eye speaketh the great contempt. 
\par 
\par "Mine ego is something which is to be surpassed: mine ego 
\par is to me the great contempt of man": so speaketh it out of 
\par that eye. 
\par 
\par When he judged himself that was his supreme moment; 
\par let not the exalted one relapse again into his low estate! 
\par 
\par There is no salvation for him who thus suffereth from him 
\par self, unless it be speedy death. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE PALE CRIMINAL 37 
\par 
\par Your slaying, ye judges, shall be pity, and not revenge; 
\par and in that ye slay, see to it that ye yourselves justify life! 
\par 
\par It is not enough that ye should reconcile with him whom 
\par ye slay. Let your sorrow be love to the Superman: thus will ye 
\par justify your own survival! 
\par 
\par "Enemy" shall ye say but not "villain," "invalid" shall ye 
\par say but not "wretch," "fool" shall ye say but not "sinner." 
\par 
\par And thou, red judge, if thou would say audibly all thou hast 
\par done in thought, then would every one cry: "Away with the 
\par nastiness and the virulent reptile!" 
\par 
\par But one thing is the thought, another thing is the deed, ana 
\par another thing is the idea of the deed. The wheel of causality 
\par doth not roll between them. 
\par 
\par An idea made this pale man pale. Adequate was he for his 
\par deed when he did it, but the idea of it, he could not endure 
\par when it was done, 
\par 
\par Evermore did he now see himself as the doer of one deed. 
\par Madness, I call this: the exception reversed itself to the rule in 
\par him. 
\par 
\par The streak of chalk bewitcheth the hen; the stroke he struck 
\par bewitched his weak reason. Madness after the deed, I call this. 
\par 
\par Hearken, ye judges! There is another madness besides, and 
\par it is before the deed. Ah! ye have not gone deep enough into 
\par this soul! 
\par 
\par Thus speaketh the red judge: "Why did this criminal com 
\par mit murder? He meant to rob." I tell you, however, that his 
\par soul wanted blood, not booty: he thirsted for the happiness of 
\par the knife! 
\par 
\par But his weak reason understood not this madness and it 
\par persuaded him. "What matter about blood!" it said; "wishest 
\par thou not, at least, to make booty thereby? Or take revenge?" 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 38 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par And he hearkened unto his weak reason: like lead lay its 
\par words upon him thereupon he robbed when he murdered. 
\par He did not mean to be ashamed of his madness. 
\par 
\par And now once more lieth the lead of his guilt upon him, 
\par and once more is his weak reason so benumbed, so paralysed, 
\par and so dull. 
\par 
\par Could he only shake his head, then would his burden roll off; 
\par but who shaketh that head? 
\par 
\par What is this man? A mass of diseases that reach out into 
\par the world through the spirit; there they want to get their 
\par prey. 
\par 
\par What is this man? A coil of wild serpents that are seldom 
\par at peace among themselves so they go forth apart and seek 
\par prey in the world. 
\par 
\par Look at that poor body! What it suffered and craved, the 
\par poor soul interpreted to itself it interpreted it as murderous 
\par desire, and eagerness for the happiness of the knife. 
\par 
\par Him who now turneth sick, the evil overtaketh which is 
\par now the evil : he seeketh to cause pain with that which causeth 
\par him pain. But there have been other ages, and another evil and 
\par good. 
\par 
\par Once was doubt evil, and the will to Self. Then the invalid 
\par became a heretic or sorcerer; as heretic or sorcerer he suffered, 
\par and sought to cause suffering. 
\par 
\par But this will not enter your ears; it hurteth your good 
\par people, ye tell me. But what doth it matter to me about your 
\par good people! 
\par 
\par Many things in your good people cause me disgust, and 
\par verily, not their evil. I would that they had a madness by which 
\par they succumbed, like this pale criminal! 
\par 
\par Verily, I would that their madness were called truth, or

\par 
\par 
\par 7. Reading and Writing 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par OF ALL that is written, I love only what a person hath written 
\par with his blood. Write with blood, and thou wilt find that blood 
\par is spirit. 
\par 
\par It is no easy task to understand unfamiliar blood; I hate the 
\par reading idlers. 
\par 
\par He who knoweth the reader, doeth nothing more for the 
\par reader. Another century of readers and spirit itself will stink. 
\par 
\par Every one being allowed to learn to read, ruineth in the long 
\par run not only writing but also thinking. 
\par 
\par Once spirit was God, then it became man, and now it even 
\par becometh populace. 
\par 
\par He that writeth in blood and proverbs doth not want to be 
\par read, but learnt by heart. 
\par 
\par In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but 
\par for that route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be 
\par peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall. 
\par 
\par The atmosphere rare and pure, danger near and the spirit 
\par full of a joyful wickedness: thus are things well matched. 
\par 
\par I want to have goblins about me, for I am courageous. The 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 4O THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par courage which scareth away ghosts, createth for itself goblins 
\par it wanteth to laugh. 
\par 
\par I no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I 
\par see beneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh 
\par that is your thunder-cloud. 
\par 
\par Ye look aloft when ye long for exaltation; and I look down 
\par ward because I am exalted. 
\par 
\par Who among you can at the same time laugh and be exalted? 
\par 
\par He who climbeth on the highest mountains, laugheth at all 
\par tragic plays and tragic realities. 
\par 
\par Courageous, unconcerned, scornful, coercive so wisdom 
\par wisheth us; she is a woman, and ever loveth only a warrior. 
\par 
\par Ye tell me, "Life is hard to bear." But for what purpose 
\par should ye have your pride in the morning and your resigna 
\par tion in the evening? 
\par 
\par Life is hard to bear: but do not affect to be so delicate! We 
\par are ail of us fine sumpter asses and she-asses. 
\par 
\par What have we in common with the rose-bud, which 
\par trembleth because a drop of dew hath formed upon it? 
\par 
\par It is true we love life; not because we are wont to live, but 
\par because we are wont to love. 
\par 
\par There is always some madness in love. But there is always, 
\par also, some method in madness. 
\par 
\par And to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and 
\par soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them amongst us, seem most 
\par to enjoy happiness. 
\par 
\par To see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit 
\par about that moveth Zarathustra to tears and songs. 
\par 
\par I should only believe in a God that would know how to 
\par dance. 
\par 
\par And when I saw rny devil, J found him serious, thorough,

\par

\par 
\par I learned to walk; since then have I let myself run. I learned

\par 8. The Tree on the Hill 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ZARATHUSTRA S eye had perceived that a certain youth avoided 
\par him. And as he walked alone one evening over the hills sur 
\par rounding the town called "The Pied Cow," behold, there 
\par found he the youth sitting leaning against a tree, and gazing 
\par with wearied look into the valley. Zarathustra thereupon laid 
\par hold of the tree beside which the youth sat, and spake thus: 
\par 
\par "If I wished to shake this tree with my hands, I should not 
\par be able to do so. 
\par 
\par But the wind, which we see not, troubleth and bendeth it a- 
\par it listeth. We are sorest bent and troubled by invisible hands." 
\par 
\par Thereupon the youth arose disconcerted, and said: "I hear 
\par Zarathustra, and just now was I thinking of him!" Zarathustra 
\par answered : 
\par 
\par "Why art thou frightened on that account? But it is the 
\par same with man as with the tree. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 42 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par The more he seeketh to rise into the height and light, the 
\par more vigorously do his roots struggle earthward, downward, 
\par into the dark and deep into the evil." 
\par 
\par "Yea, into the evil!" cried the youth. "How is it possible 
\par that thou hast discovered my soul?" 
\par 
\par Zarathustra smiled, and said: "Many a soul one will never 
\par discover, unless one first invent it." 
\par 
\par "Yea, into the evil!" cried the youth once more. 
\par 
\par "Thou saidst the truth, Zarathustra. I trust myself no longer 
\par since I sought to rise into the height, and nobody trusteth me 
\par *ny longer; how doth that happen? 
\par 
\par I change too quickly: my to-day refuteth my yesterday. I 
\par often overleap the steps when I clamber; for so doing, none of 
\par the steps pardons me. 
\par 
\par When aloft, I find myself always alone. No one speaketh 
\par unto me; the frost of solitude maketh me tremble. What do I 
\par seek on the height? 
\par 
\par My contempt and my longing increase together; the higher 
\par I clamber, the more do I despise him who clambereth. What 
\par doth he seek on the height? 
\par 
\par How ashamed I am of my clambering and stumbling! How 
\par I mock at my violent panting! How I hate him who flieth! How 
\par tired I am on the height!" 
\par 
\par Here the youth was silent. And Zarathustra. contemplated 
\par the tree beside which they stood, and spake thus: 
\par 
\par "This tree standeth lonely here on the hills; it hath grown 
\par up high above man and beast. 
\par 
\par And if it wanted to speak, it would have none who could 
\par understand it: so high hath it grown. 
\par 
\par Now it waiteth and waiteth, for what doth it wait? It 
\par dwelleth too close to the seat of the clouds; it waiteth perhaps 
\par for the first lightning?" 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE TREE ON THE HILL 43 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra had said this, the youth called out with 
\par violent gestures: "Yea, Zarathustra, thou speakest the truth. 
\par My destruction I longed for, when I desired to be on the 
\par height, and thou art the lightning for which I waited! Lo! 
\par what have I been since thou hast appeared amongst us? It is 
\par mine envy of thee that hath destroyed me!" Thus spake the 
\par youth, and wept bitterly. Zarathustra, however, put his arm 
\par about him, and led the youth away with him. 
\par 
\par And when they had walked a while together, Zarathustra 
\par began to speak thus : 
\par 
\par It rendeth my heart. Better than thy words express it, thine 
\par eyes tell me all thy danger. 
\par 
\par As yet thou art not free; thou still seekest freedom. Too un- 
\par slept hath thy seeking made thee, and too wakeful. 
\par 
\par On the open height wouldst thou be; for the stars thirsteth 
\par thy soul. But thy bad impulses also thirst for freedom.

\par when thy spirit endeavoureth to open all prison doors. 
\par 
\par Still art thou a prisoner it seemeth to me who deviseth 
\par liberty for himself: ah! sharp becometh the soul of such 
\par prisoners, but also deceitful and wicked. 
\par 
\par To purify himself, is still necessary for the freedman of 
\par the spirit. Much of the prison and the mould still remaineth 
\par in him: pure hath his eye still to become. 
\par 
\par Yea, I know thy danger. But by my love and hope I con 
\par jure thee: cast not thy love and hope away!

\par Noble thou feelest thyself still, and noble others also feel 
\par thee still, though they bear thee a grudge and cast evil lookb. 
\par Know this, that to everybody a noble one standeth in the way.

\par 
\par There are the terrible ones who carry about in themselves

\par SOMEWHERE there are still peoples and herds, but not with us, 
\par my brethren: here there are states. 
\par 
\par A state? What is that? Well! open now your ears unto me, 
\par for now will I say unto you my word concerning the death of 
\par peoples. 
\par 
\par A state, is called the coldest of all cold monsters. Coldly lieth 
\par it also; and this lie creepeth from its mouth: "I, the state, am 
\par the people." 
\par 
\par It is a lie! Creators were they who created peoples, and hung 
\par a faith and a love over them : thus they served life. 
\par 
\par Destroyers, are they who lay snares for many, and call it the 
\par state: they hang a sword and a hundred cravings over them. 
\par 
\par Where there is still a people, there the state is not under 
\par stood, but hated as the evil eye, and as sin against laws and 
\par customs. 
\par 
\par This sign I give unto you: every people speaketh its lan 
\par guage of good and evil : this its neighbour understandeth not. 
\par Its language hath it devised for itself in laws and customs. 
\par 
\par But the state lieth in all languages of good and evil; and 
\par whatever it saith it Jieth; and whatever it hath it hath stolen.

\par "Be at least mine enemy!" thus speaketh the true rever 
\par ence, which doth not venture to solicit friendship. 
\par 
\par If one would have a friend, then must one also be willing 
\par to wage war for him: and in order to wage war, one must be

\par 
\par One ought still to honour the enemy in one s friend. Canst 
\par thou go nigh unto thy friend, and not go over to him? 
\par 
\par In one s friend one shall have one s best enemy. Thou shalt 
\par be closest unto him with thy heart when thou withstandest him. 
\par 
\par Thou wouldst wear no raiment before thy friend? It is in 
\par honour of thy friend that thou showest thyself to him as thou 
\par art? But he wisheth thee to the devil on that account!

\par He who maketh no secret of himself shocketh: so much

\par could then be ashamed of clothing!

\par Sawest thou ever thy friend asleep? Wert thou not dis 
\par mayed at thy friend looking so? O my friend, man is some 
\par thing that hath to be surpassed.

\par In divining and keeping silence shall the friend be a master: 
\par not everything must thou wish to see. Thy dream shall dis

\par Through valuation only is there value; and without valua 
\par tion the nut of existence would be hollow. Hear it, ye creating 
\par ones! 
\par 
\par Change of values that is, change of the creating ones. 
\par Always doth he destroy who hath to be a creator. 
\par 
\par Creating ones were first of all peoples, and only in late 
\par times individuals; verily, the individual himself is still the 
\par latest creation. 
\par 
\par Peoples once hung over them tables of the good. Love which 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 62 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par would rule and love which would obey, created for themselves 
\par such tables. 
\par 
\par Older is the pleasure in the herd than the pleasure in the 
\par ego : and as long as the good conscience is for the herd, the bad 
\par conscience only saith: ego. 
\par 
\par Verily, the crafty ego, the loveless one, that seeketh its 
\par advantage in the advantage of many it is not the origin of the 
\par herd, but its ruin. 
\par 
\par Loving ones, was it always, and creating ones, that created 
\par .good and bad. Fire of love gloweth in the names of all the 
\par virtues, and fire of wrath. 
\par 
\par Many lands saw Zarathustra, and many peoples : no greater 
\par power did Zarathustra find on earth than the creations of the 
\par loving ones "good" and "bad" are they called. 
\par 
\par Verily, a prodigy is this power of praising and blaming. 
\par Tell me, ye brethren, who will master it for me? Who will put 
\par a fetter upon the thousand necks of this animal? 
\par 
\par A thousand goals have there been hitherto, for a thousand 
\par peoples have there been. Only the fetter for the thousand 
\par necks is still lacking; there is lacking the one goal. As yet 
\par humanity hath not a goal. 
\par 
\par But pray tell me, my brethren, if the goal of humanity be stil?

\par NEIGHBOltA-LO V E 63 
\par 
\par 16. Neighbour-Love 
\par 
\par YE CROWD around your neighbour, and have fine words for it 
\par But I say unto you: your neighbour-love is your bad love of 
\par yourselves. 
\par 
\par Ye flee unto your neighbour from yourselves, and would 
\par fain make a virtue thereof: but I fathom your "unselfishness." 
\par 
\par The Thou is older than the /; the Thou hath been conse 
\par crated, but not yet the /: so man presseth nigh unto his neigh 
\par bour. 
\par 
\par Do I advise you to neighbour-love? Rather do I advise you 
\par to neighbour-flight and to furthest love! 
\par 
\par Higher than love to your neighbour is love to the furthest 
\par and future ones; higher still than love to men, is love to things 
\par and phantoms. 
\par 
\par The phantom that runneth on before thee, my brother, is 
\par fairer than thou; why dost thou not give unto it thy flesh and 
\par thy bones? But thou fearest, and runnest unto thy neighbour. 
\par 
\par Ye cannot endure it with yourselves, and do not love your 
\par selves sufficiently: so ye seek to mislead your neighbour into 
\par love, and would fain gild yourselves with his error. 
\par 
\par Would that ye could not endure it with any kind of near 
\par ones, or their neighbours; then would ye have to create your 
\par friend and his overflowing heart out of yourselves. 
\par 
\par Ye call in a witness when ye want to speak well of your 
\par selves; and when ye have misled him to think well of you, y^ 
\par also think well of yourselves. 
\par 
\par Not only doth he lie, who speaketh contrary to his knowl 
\par edge, but more so, he who speaketh contrary to his ignorance. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 64 I HUS SPAKE ZARATHU5, TRA 
\par 
\par And thus speak ye of yourselves in your intercourse,, and belie 
\par your neighbour with yourselves. 
\par 
\par Thus saith tLe fool: "Association with men spoileth the 
\par character, especially when one hath none. 
\par 
\par The one goeth to his neighbour because he seeketh him 
\par self, and the other because he would fain lose himself. Your 
\par bad love to yourselves maketh solitude a prison to you. 
\par 
\par The furthest ones are they who pay for your love to the 
\par near ones; and when there arc but five of you together, a sixth 
\par must always die. 
\par 
\par I love not your festivals either: too many actors found I 
\par there, and even the spectators often behaved like actors. 
\par 
\par Not the neighbour do I teach you, but the friend. Let the 
\par friend be the festival of the earth to you, and a foretaste of 
\par the Superman. 
\par 
\par I teach you the friend and his overflowing heart. But one 
\par must know how to be a sponge, if one would be loved by over 
\par flowing hearts. 
\par 
\par I teach you the friend in whom the world standeth complete, 
\par a capsule of the good, the creating friend, who hath always a 
\par complete world to bestow. 
\par 
\par And as the world unrolled itself for him, so rolleth it to 
\par gether again for him in rings, as the growth of good through 
\par evil, as the growth of purpose out of chance. 
\par 
\par Let the future and the furthest be the motive of thy today; 
\par in thy friend shalt thou love the Superman as thy motive. 
\par 
\par My brethren, I advise you not to neighbour-love I advise 
\par fou to furthest love!

\par 
\par 17. The Way of the Creating One 
\par 
\par WOULDST thou ge into isolation, my brother? Wouldst thop 
\par seek the way unto thyself? Tarry yet a little and hearken unto 
\par me. 
\par 
\par "Ke who seeketh may easily get lost himself. All isolation 
\par is wrong" : so say the herd. And long didst thou belong to the 
\par herd. 
\par 
\par The voice of the herd will still echo in thee. And when thou 
\par sayest, "I have no longer a conscience in. common with you," 
\par then will it be a plaint and a pain. 
\par 
\par Lo, that pain itself did the same conscience produce; and 
\par the last gleam of that conscience still gloweth on thine afflic^ 
\par tion. 
\par 
\par But thou wouldst go the way of thine affliction, which is the 
\par way unto thyself? Then show me thine authority and thy 
\par strength to do so! 
\par 
\par Art thou a new strength and a new authority? A first 
\par motion? A self -rolling wheel? Canst thou also compel stars 
\par to revolve around thee? 
\par 
\par Alas! there is so much lusting for loftiness! There are so 
\par many convulsions of the ambitions! Show me that thou art not 
\par a lusting and ambitious one! 
\par 
\par Alas! there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more 
\par than the bellows: they inflate, and make emptier than ever. 
\par 
\par Free, dost thou call thyself? Thy ruling thought would I 
\par hear of, and not that thou hast escaped from a yoke. 
\par 
\par Art thou one entitled to escape from a yoke? Many a one 
\par hath cast away his final worth when he hath cast away his 
\par servitude. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 66 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Free from what? What doth that matter to Zarathustra! 
\par Clearly, however, shall thine eye show unto me: free for what? 
\par 
\par Canst thou give unto thyself thy bad and thy good, and set 
\par up thy will as a law over thee? Canst thou be judge for thyself, 
\par and avenger of thy law? 
\par 
\par Terrible is aloneness with the judge and avenger of one s 
\par own law. Thus is a star projected into desert space, and into the 
\par icy breath of aloneness. 
\par 
\par To-day sufferest thou still from the multitude, thou individ 
\par ual; to-day hast thou still thy courage unabated, and thy hopes. 
\par 
\par But one day will the solitude weary thee; one day will thy 
\par pride yield, and thy courage quail. Thou wilt one day cry: "I 
\par am alone!" 
\par 
\par One day wilt thou see no longer thy loftiness, and see too 
\par closely thy lowliness; thy sublimity itself will frighten thee as 
\par a phantom. Thou wilt one day cry: "All is false!" 
\par 
\par There are feelings which seek to slay the lonesome one; if 
\par they do not succeed, then must they themselves die! But art 
\par thou capable of it to be a murderer? 
\par 
\par Hast thou ever known, my brother, the word "disdain"? 
\par And the anguish of thy justice in being just to those that dis 
\par dain thee? 
\par 
\par Thou forcest many to think differently about thee; that, 
\par charge they heavily to thine account. Thou earnest nigh unto 
\par them, and yet wentest past: for that they never forgive thee. 
\par 
\par Thou goest beyond them: but the higher thou risest, the 
\par smaller doth the eye of envy see thee. Most of all, however, is 
\par the flying one hated. 
\par 
\par "How could ye be just unto me!" must thou say "I

\par 
\par Be on thy guard, also, against holy simplicity! All is unholy 
\par to it that is not simple; fain, likewise, would it play with the

\par 
\par And be on thy guard, also, against the assaults of thy love! 
\par Too readily doth the recluse reach his hand to any one who 
\par meeteth him. 
\par 
\par To many a one mayest thou not give thy hand, but only thy

\par 
\par But the worst enemy thou canst meet, wilt thou thyself

\par 
\par Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way to thyself! And

\par 
\par A heretic wilt thou be to thyself, and a wizard and a sooth

\par 
\par Ready must thou be to burn thyself in thine own flame; how

\par 
\par Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the creating one:

\par 
\par Thou lonesome one, thou goest the way of the loving one: 
\par thou lovest thyself, and on that account despisest thou thyself, 
\par as only the loving ones despise. 
\par 
\par To create, desireth the loving one, because he despiseth! 
\par What knoweth he of love who hath not been obliged to despise

\par 
\par 68 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par With my tears, go into thine isolation, my brother. I love 
\par him who seeketh to create beyond himself, and thus sue- 
\par cumbeth. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 18. Old and Young Women 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHY stealest thou along so furtively in the twilight, 
\par thustra? And what hidest thou so carefully under thy mantle? 
\par 
\par Is it a treasure that hath been given thee? Or a child that 
\par nath been born thee? Or goest thou thyself on a thief s errand, 
\par thou friend of the evil? 
\par 
\par Verily, my brother, said Zarathustra, it is a treasure that 
\par hath been given me: it is a little truth which I carry. 
\par 
\par But it is naughty, like a young child; and if I hold not its 
\par mouth, it screameth too loudly. 
\par 
\par As I went on my way alone today, at the hour when the 
\par tun declineth, there met me an old woman, and she spake thus 
\par unto my soul : 
\par 
\par "Much hath Zarathustra spoken also to us women, but 
\par never spake he unto us concerning woman." 
\par 
\par And I answered her: "Concerning woman, one should only 
\par talk unto men." 
\par 
\par "Talk also unto me of woman," said she; "I am old enough 
\par to forget it presently." 
\par 
\par And I obliged the old woman and spake thus unto her: 
\par 
\par Everything in woman is a riddle, and everything in woman 
\par liath one solution it is called pregnancy. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par OLD AND YOUNG WOMEN 69 
\par 
\par Man is for woman a means: the purpose is always the child. 
\par But what is woman for man? 
\par 
\par Two different things wanteth the true man: danger and 
\par diversion. Therefore wanteth he woman, as the most danger 
\par ous plaything. 
\par 
\par * Man shall be trained for war, and woman for the recreation 
\par of the warrior: all else is folly. 
\par 
\par Too sweet fruits these the warrior liketh not. Therefore 
\par liketh he woman; bitter is even the sweetest woman. 
\par 
\par Better than man doth woman understand children, but man 
\par is more childish than woman. 
\par 
\par In the true man there is a child hidden: it wanteth to play. 
\par Up then, ye women, and discover the child in man! 
\par 
\par A plaything let woman be, pure and fine like the precious 
\par stone, illumined with the virtues of a world not yet come. 
\par 
\par Let the beam of a star shine in your love! Let your hope say: 
\par "May I bear the Superman!" 
\par 
\par In your love let there be valour! With your love shall ye 
\par assail him who inspireth you with fear! 
\par 
\par In your love be your honour! Little doth woman understand 
\par otherwise about honour. But let this be your honour: always 
\par to love more than ye are loved, and never be the second. 
\par 
\par Let man fear woman when she loveth: then maketh she 
\par every sacrifice, and everything else she regardeth as worthless. 
\par 
\par Let man fear woman when she hateth : for man in his inner 
\par most soul is merely evil; woman, however, is mean. 
\par 
\par Whom hateth woman most? Thus spake the iron to the 
\par loadstone: "I hate thee most, because thou attractest, but art 
\par too weak to draw unto thee." 
\par 
\par The happiness of man is, "I will." The happiness of woman 
\par is, "He will." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 70 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par "Lo! now hath the world become perfect!" thus thinketh 
\par every woman when she obeyeth with all her love. 
\par 
\par Obey, must the woman, and find a depth for her surface. 
\par Surface is woman s soul, a mobile, stormy film on shallow 
\par water. 
\par 
\par Man s soul, however, is deep, its current gusheth in subter 
\par ranean caverns : woman surmiseth its force, but comprehended! 
\par it not. 
\par 
\par Then answered me the old woman: Many fine things hath 
\par Zarathustra said, especially for those who are young enough 
\par for them. 
\par 
\par Strange! Zarathustra knoweth little about woman, and yet 
\par he is right about them! Doth this happen, because with women 
\par nothing is impossible? 
\par 
\par And now accept a little truth by way of thanks! I am old 
\par enough for it! 
\par 
\par Swaddle it up and hold its mouth : otherwise it will scream 
\par too loudly, the little truth." 
\par 
\par "Give me, woman, thy little truth!" said I. And thus spake 
\par the old woman : 
\par 
\par "Thou goest to women? Do not forget thy whip!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par The Bite of the Adder 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ONE day had Zarathustra fallen asleep under a fig-tree, owing 
\par to the heat, with his arm over his face. And there came an 
\par adder and bit him in the neck, so that Zarathustra screamed 
\par with pain. When he had taken his arm from his face he looked 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE BITE OF THE ADDER 7! 
\par 
\par at the serpent; and then did it recognise the eyes of Zarathustra, 
\par wriggled awkwardly, and tried to get away. "Not at all/ said 
\par Zarathustra, "as yet hast thou not received my thanks! Thou 
\par hast awakened me in time; my journey is yet long." "Thy 
\par journey is short," said the adder sadly; "my poison is fatal." 
\par Zarathustra smiled. "When did ever a dragon die of a serpent s 
\par poison?" said he. "But take thy poison back! Thou art not 
\par rich enough to present it to me." Then fell the adder again on 
\par his neck, and licked his wound. 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra once told this to his disciples they asked 
\par him: "And what, O Zarathustra, is the moral of thy story?" 
\par And Zarathustra answered them thus : 
\par 
\par The destroyer of morality, the good and just call me: my 
\par story is immoral. 
\par 
\par When, however, ye have an enemy, then return him not 
\par good for evil: for that would abash him. But prove that he 
\par hath done something good to you. 
\par 
\par And rather be angry than abash any one! And when ye are 
\par cursed, it pleaseth me not that ye should then desire to bless. 
\par Rather curse a little also! 
\par 
\par And should a great injustice befall you, then do quickly five 
\par small ones besides. Hideous to behold is he on whom injustice 
\par presseth alone. 
\par 
\par Did ye ever know this? Shared injustice is half justice. And 
\par he who can bear it, shall take the injustice upon himself! 
\par 
\par A small revenge is humaner than no revenge at all. And if 
\par the punishment be not also a right and an honour to the trans 
\par gressor, I do not like your punishing. 
\par 
\par Nobler is it to own oneself in the wrong than to establish 
\par one s right, especially if one be in the right. Only, one must be 
\par rich enough to do so. 
\par 
\par I do not like your cold justice; out of the eye of your judges

\par Devise me, then, the love which not only beareth all punish 
\par ment, but also all guilt! 
\par 
\par Devise me, then, the justice which acquitteth every one

\par 
\par And would ye hear this likewise? To him who seeketh to be 
\par just from the heart, even the lie becometh philanthropy. 
\par 
\par But how could I be just from the heart! How can I give every 
\par one his own! Let this be enough for me: I give unto every one 
\par mine own. 
\par 
\par finally, my brethren, guard against doing wrong to any 
\par anchorite. How could an anchorite forget! How could he

\par 
\par I HAVE a question for thee alone, my brother: like a sounding-

\par depth. 
\par 
\par Thou art young, and desirest child and marriage. But I asK

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHILD AND MARRIAGE 73 
\par 
\par Art thou the victorious one, the self -conqueror, the ruler of 
\par thy passions, the master of thy virtues? Thus do I ask thee. 
\par 
\par Or doth the animal speak in thy wish, and necessity? Or iso 
\par lation? Or discord in thee? 
\par 
\par I would have thy victory and freedom long for a child. 
\par Living monuments shalt thou build to thy victory and emanci 
\par pation. 
\par 
\par Beyond thyself shalt thou build. But first of all must thou 
\par be built thyself, rectangular in body and soul. 
\par 
\par Not only onward shalt thou propagate thyself, but upward! 
\par For that purpose may the garden of marriage help thee! 
\par 
\par A higher body shalt thou create, a first movement, a spon 
\par taneously rolling wheel a creating one shalt thou create. 
\par 
\par Marriage: so call I the will of the twain to create the one that 
\par is more than those who created it. The reverence for one an 
\par other, as those exercising such a will, call I marriage. 
\par 
\par Let this be the significance and the truth of thy marriage. 
\par But that which the many-too-many call marriage, those super 
\par fluous ones ah, what shall I call it? 
\par 
\par Ah, the poverty of soul in the twain! Ah, the filth of soul in 
\par the twain! Ah, the pitiable self-complacency in the twain! 
\par 
\par Marriage they call it all; and they say their marriages are 
\par made in heaven. 
\par 
\par Well, I do not like it, that heaven of the superfluous! No, I 
\par do not like them, those animals tangled in the heavenly toils! 
\par 
\par Far from me also be the God who limpeth thither to bless 
\par what he hath not matched! 
\par 
\par Laugh not at such marriages! What child hath not had reason 
\par to weep over its parents? 
\par 
\par Worthy did this man seem, and ripe for the meaning of the 
\par earth; but when I saw his wife, tn~ ~arth Deemed to me a home 
\par for madcaps.

\par 
\par 74 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Yea. 1 would that the earth shook with convulsions when a 
\par saint ana a goose mate with one another. 
\par 
\par This one went forth in quest of truth as a hero, and at last 
\par got for himself a small decked-up lie: his marriage he calleth it. 
\par 
\par That one was reserved in intercourse and chose choicely. Rut 
\par one time he spoilt his company for all time: his marriage he 
\par calleth it. 
\par 
\par Another sought a handmaid with the virtues of an angel. 
\par But all at once he became the handmaid of a woman, and now 
\par would he need also to become an angel. 
\par 
\par Careful, have I found all buyers, and all of them have astute 
\par eyes. But even the astutest of them buyeth his wife in a sack. 
\par 
\par Many short follies that is called love by you. And your

\par .stupidity. 
\par 
\par Your love to woman, and woman s love to man ah, would 
\par that it were sympathy for suffering and veiled deities! But 
\par generally two animals alight on one another. 
\par 
\par But even your best love is only an enraptured simile and a 
\par painful ardour. It is a torch to light you to loftier paths. 
\par 
\par Beyond yourselves shall ye love some day! Then learn first 
\par of all to love. And on that account ye had to drink the bitter 
\par cup of your love. 
\par 
\par Bitterness is in the cup even of the best love; thus doth it 
\par cause longing for the Superman; thus doth it cause thirst in 
\par thee, the creating one! 
\par 
\par Thirst in the creating one, arrow and longing for the Supei 
\par man: tell me, my brother, is this thy will to marriage? 
\par 
\par Holy call I such a will, and such a marriage.

\par VOLUNTARY DEATH 75 
\par 
\par 21. Voluntary Death 
\par 
\par MANY die too late, and some die too early. Yet strange 
\par soundeth the precept: "Die at the right time!" 
\par 
\par Die at the right time : so teacheth Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par To be sure, he who never liveth at the right time, how coi ild 
\par he ever die at the right time? Would that he might never be 
\par born! Thus do I advise the superfluous ones. 
\par 
\par But even the superfluous ones make much ado about theii 
\par death, and even the hollowest nut wanteth to be cracked. 
\par 
\par Every one regardeth dying as a great matter: but as yet death 
\par is not a festival. Not yet have people learned to inaugurate the 
\par finest festivals. 
\par 
\par The consummating death I show unto you, which becometh 
\par a stimulus and promise to the living. 
\par 
\par His death, dieth the consummating one triumphantly, sur 
\par rounded by hoping and promising ones. 
\par 
\par Thus should one learn to die; and there should be no festival 
\par at which such a dying one doth not consecrate the oaths of the 
\par living! 
\par 
\par Thus to die is best; the next best, however, is to die in battle, 
\par and sacrifice a great soul. 
\par 
\par But to the fighter equally hateful as to the victor, is your 
\par grinning death which stealeth nigh like a thief, and yet 
\par cometh as master. 
\par 
\par My death, praise I unto you, the voluntary death, which 
\par cometh unto me because 7 want it. 
\par 
\par And when shall I want it? He that hath a goal and an heir,

\par VOLUNTARY DEATH 7/ 
\par 
\par Verily, too early died that Hebrew whom the preachers of

\par he died too early. 
\par 
\par As yet had he known only tears, and the. melancholy of the 
\par Hebrews, together with the hatred of the good and just 
\par the Hebrew Jesus: then was he seized with the longing for 
\par death. 
\par 
\par Had he but remained in the wilderness, and far from the 
\par good and just! Then, perhaps, would he have learned to live, 
\par and love the earth and laughter also! 
\par 
\par Believe it, my brethren! He died too early; he himself would 
\par have disavowed his doctrine had he attained to my age! Noble 
\par enough was he to disavow! 
\par 
\par But he was still immature, Immaturely loveth the youth, and 
\par immaturely also hateth he man and earth. Confined and awk

\par 
\par But in man there is more of the child than in the youth, and 
\par less of melancholy: better understandeth he about life and

\par 
\par Free for death, and free in death; a holy Naysayer, when

\par That your dying may not be a reproach to man and the

\par 
\par Verily, a goal had Zarathustra; he threw his ball. Now be ye 
\par friends the heirs of my goal; to you throw I the golden ball. 
\par 
\par Best of all, do I see you, my friends, throw the golden ball! 
\par And so tarry I still a little while on the earth pardon me for it! 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 22. The Bestowing Virtue 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHEN Zarathustra had taken leave of the town to which his 
\par heart was attached, the name of which is "The Pied Cow," 
\par there followed him many people who called themselves his 
\par disciples, and kept him company. Thus came they to a cross 
\par roads. Then Zarathustra told them that he now wanted to go 
\par alone; for he was fond of going alone. His disciples, however, 
\par presented him at his departure with a staff, on the golden 
\par handle of which a serpent twined round the sun. Zarathustra 
\par rejoiced on account of the staff, and supported himself thereon; 
\par then spake he thus to his disciples : 
\par 
\par Tell me, pray: how came gold to the highest value? Because 
\par it is uncommon, and unprofiting, and beaming, and soft in 
\par lustre; it always bestoweth itself. 
\par 
\par Only as image of the highest virtue came gold to the highest 
\par value. Goldlike, beameth the glance of the bestower. Gold- 
\par lustre maketh peace between moon and sun. 
\par 
\par Uncommon is the highest virtue, and unprcftting, beaming 
\par &lt;s it, and soft of lustre: a bestowing virtue is the highest virtue. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE BESTOWING VIRTUE 79 
\par 
\par Verily, I divine you well, my disciples : ye strive like me for 
\par the bestowing virtue. What should ye have in common with 
\par cats and wolves? 
\par 
\par It is your thirst to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves : and 
\par tlieref ore have ye the thirst to accumulate ail riches in your soul. 
\par 
\par Insatiably striveth your soul for treasures and jewels, be 
\par cause your virtue is insatiable in desiring to bestow. 
\par 
\par Ye constrain all things to flow towards you and into you, 
\par so that they shall flow back again out of your fountain as the 
\par gifts of your love. 
\par 
\par Verily, an appropriator of all values must such bestowing 
\par love become; but healthy and holy, call I this selfishness. 
\par 
\par Another selfishness is there, an all-too-poor and hungry 
\par kind, which would always steal the selfishness of the sick, 
\par the sickly selfishness. 
\par 
\par With the eye of the thief it looketh upon all that is lustrous; 
\par with the craving of hunger it measureth him who hath abun 
\par dance; and ever doth it prowl round the tables of bestowers. 
\par 
\par Sickness speaketh in such craving, and invisible degenera 
\par tion; of a sickly body, speaketh the larcenous craving of this 
\par selfishness. 
\par 
\par Tell me, my brother, what do we think bad, and worst of 
\par all? Is it not degeneration? And we always suspect degenera 
\par tion when the bestowing soul is lacking. 
\par 
\par Upward goeth our course from genera on to super-genera. 
\par But a horror to us is the degenerating sense, which saitn: "All 
\par for myself." 
\par 
\par Upward soareth our sense: thus is it a simile of our body, a 
\par simile of an ele\\ a^ion. Such similes of elevations are the names 
\par of the virtues. 
\par 
\par Thus goeth the body through history, a becomer and fighter 
\par

\par 
\par 80 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA

\par And the spirit what is it to the body? Its fights and victories 
\par herald, its companion and echo. 
\par 
\par Similes, are all names of good and evil; they do not speak 
\par out, they only hint. A fool who seeketh knowledge from them! 
\par 
\par Give heed, my brethren, to every hour when your spirit 
\par would speak in similes : there is the origin of your virtue. 
\par 
\par Elevated is then your body, and raised up; with its delight, 
\par enraptureth it the spirit; so that it becometh creator, and 
\par valuer, and lover, and everything s benefactor. 
\par 
\par When your heart overfloweth broad and full like the river, 
\par a blessing and a danger to the lowlanders: there is the origin 
\par of your virtue. 
\par 
\par When ye are exalted above praise and blame, and your will 
\par would command all things, as a loving one s will: there is the 
\par origin of your virtue. 
\par 
\par When ye despise pleasant things, and the effeminate couch, 
\par and cannot couch far enough from the effeminate: there is the 
\par origin of your virtue. 
\par 
\par When ye are willers of one will, and when that change of 
\par every need is needful to you: there is the origin of your virtue. 
\par 
\par Verily, a new good and evil is it! Verily, a new deep mur 
\par muring, and the voice of a new fountain! 
\par 
\par Power is it, this new virtue; a ruling thought is it, and 
\par around it a subtle soul: a golden sun, with the serpent of 
\par knowledge around it. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Here paused Zarathustra awhile, and looked lovingly on 
\par his disciples. Then he continued to speak thus and his voice 
\par had changed: 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE BESTOWING VIRTUE 8l 
\par 
\par Remain true to the earth, my brethren, with the power of 
\par your virtue! Let your bestowing love and your knowledge be 
\par devoted to be the meaning of the earth! Thus do I pray and 
\par conjure you. 
\par 
\par Let it not fly away from the earthly and beat against eternal 
\par walls with its wings! Ah, there hath always been so much 
\par flown-away virtue! 
\par 
\par Lead, like me, the flown-away virtue back to the earth yea, 
\par back to body and life: that it may give to the earth its mean 
\par ing, a human meaning! 
\par 
\par A hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue flown 
\par away and blundered. Alas! in our body dwelleth still all this 
\par delusion and blundering: body and will hath it there become. 
\par 
\par A hundred times hitherto hath spirit as well as virtue at 
\par tempted and erred. Yea, an attempt hath man been. Alas, 
\par much ignorance and error hath become embodied in us! 
\par 
\par Not only the rationality of millennia also their mad 
\par ness, breaketh out in us. Dangerous is it to be an heir. 
\par 
\par Still fight we step by step with the giant Chance, and over 
\par all mankind hath hitherto ruled nonsense, the lack-of -sense. 
\par 
\par Let your spirit and your virtue be devoted to the sense of the 
\par earth, my brethren: let the value of everything be determined 
\par anew by you! Therefore shall ye be fighters! Therefore shall 
\par ye be creators!

\par 23. The Child with the Mirror 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AFTER this Zarathustra returned again into the mountains tx 
\par the solitude of his cave, and withdrew himself from men, 
\par waiting like a sower who hath scattered his seed. His soul, 
\par however, became impatient and full of longing for those 
\par whom he loved: because he had still much to give them. For 
\par this is hardest of all : to close the open hand out of love, and 
\par keep modest as a giver. 
\par 
\par Thus passed with the lonesome one months and years; his 
\par wisdom meanwhile increased, and caused him pain by its 
\par abundance. 
\par 
\par One morning, however, he awoke ere the rosy dawn, and 
\par having meditated long on his couch, at last spake thus to his 
\par heart : 
\par 
\par Why did I startle in my dream, so that I awoke? Did not a 
\par child come to me, carrying a mirror? 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra" said the child unto me "look at thyself 
\par in the mirror!" 
\par 
\par But when I looked into the mirror, I shrieked, and my heart 
\par throbbed: for not myself did I see therein, but a devil s 
\par grimace and derision. 
\par 
\par Verily, all too well do I understand the dream s portent and 
\par monition: my doctrine is in danger; tares want to be called 
\par wheat!

\par 
\par Lost are my friends; the hour hath come for me to seek my 
\par lost ones! 
\par 
\par With these words Zarathustra started up, not however like 
\par a person in anguish seeking relief, but rather like a seer and a 
\par singer whom the spirit inspireth. With amazement did his 
\par eagle and serpent gaze upon him: for a coming bliss over 
\par spread his countenance like the rosy dawn. 
\par 
\par What hath happened unto me, mine animals? said Zara

\par like a whirlwind? 
\par 
\par Foolish is my happiness, and foolish things will it speak: it

\par 
\par To my friends can I again go down, and also to mine

\par his best love to his loved ones! 
\par 
\par My impatient love overflowed! in streams, down towards 
\par sunrise and sunset. Out of silent mountains and storms of 
\par affliction, rusheth my soul into the valleys. 
\par 
\par Too long have I longed and looked into the distance. Too 
\par long hath solitude possessed me: thus have I unlearned to keep 
\par silence. 
\par 
\par Utterance have I become altogether, and the brawling of a

\par 
\par New paths do I tread, a new speech cometh unto me; tired

\par 
\par Too slowly runneth all speaking for me: into thy chariot,

\par The beauty of the superman came unto me as a shadow. Ah, 
\par my brethren! Of what account now are the gods to me! 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par . The Pitiful 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par MY FRIENDS, there hath arisen a satire on your friend: "Be 
\par hold Zarathustra! Walketh he not amongst us as if amongst 
\par animals?" 
\par 
\par But it is better said in this wise: "The discerning one walketh 
\par amongst men as amongst animals." 
\par 
\par Man himself is to the discerning one: the animal with red 
\par cheeks. 
\par 
\par How hath that happened unto him? Is it not because he hath 
\par had to be ashamed too oft? 
\par 
\par O my friends! Thus speaketh the discerning one: shame, 
\par shame, shame that is the history of man! 
\par 
\par And on that account doth the noble one enjoin on him 
\par self not to abash: bashfulness doth he enjoin himself in 
\par presence of all sufferers. 
\par 
\par Verily, I like them not, the merciful ones, whose bliss is 
\par In their pity: too destitute are they of bashfulness. 
\par 
\par If I must be pitiful, I dislike to be called so; and if I be so. 
\par it is preferably at a distance. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 94 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Preferably also do I shroud my head, and flee, before being 
\par recognised: and thus do I bid you do, my friends! 
\par 
\par May my destiny ever lead unafSicted ones like you across my 
\par path, and those with whom I may have hope and repast and 
\par honey in common! 
\par 
\par Verily, I have done this and that for the afflicted: but some 
\par thing better did I always seem to do when I had learned to 
\par enjoy myself better. 
\par 
\par Since humanity came into being, man hath enjoyed himself 
\par too little: that alone, my brethren, is our original sin! 
\par 
\par And when we learn better to enjoy ourselves, then do we 
\par unlearn best to give pain unto others, and to contrive pain. 
\par 
\par Therefore do I wash the hand that hach helped the sufferer; 
\par therefore do I wipe also my soul. 
\par 
\par For in seeing the sufferer suffering thereof was I ashamed 
\par on account of his shame; and in helping him, sorely did I 
\par wound his pride. 
\par 
\par Great obligations do not make grateful, but revengeful; and 
\par when a small kindness is not forgotten, it becometh a gnawing 
\par worm. 
\par 
\par "Be shy in accepting! Distinguish by accepting!" thus do 
\par I advise those who have naught to bestow. 
\par 
\par I, however, am a bestower: willingly do I bestow as friend 
\par to friends. Strangers, however, and the poor, may pluck for 
\par themselves the fruit from my tree: thus doth it cause less 
\par shame. 
\par 
\par Beggars, however, one should entirely do away with! Verily, 
\par it annoy eth one to give unto them, and it annoy eth one not to 
\par give unto them. 
\par 
\par And likewise sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my 
\par friends: the sting of conscience teacheth one to sting. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE PITIFUL 95 
\par 
\par The worst things, however, are the petty thoughts. Verily, 
\par better to have done evilly than to have thought pettily! 
\par 
\par To be sure, ye say: "The delight in petty evils spareth one 
\par many a great evil deed." But here one should not wish to be 
\par sparing. 
\par 
\par Like a boil is the evil deed: it itcheth and irritateth and 
\par breaketh forth it speaketh honourably. 
\par 
\par "Behold, I am disease," saith the evil deed: that is its 
\par honourableness. 
\par 
\par But like infection is the petty thought: it creepeth and 
\par hideth, and wanteth to be nowhere until the whole body is 
\par decayed and withered by the petty infection. 
\par 
\par To him however, who is possessed of a devil, I would 
\par whisper this word in the ear: "Better for thee to rear up thy 
\par devil! Even for thee there is still a path to greatness!" 
\par 
\par Ah, my brethren! One knoweth a little too much about every 
\par one! And many a one becometh transparent to us, but still we 
\par can by no means penetrate him. 
\par 
\par It is difficult to live among men because silence is so difficult. 
\par 
\par And not to him who is offensive to us are we most unfair, 
\par but to him who doth not concern us at all. 
\par 
\par If, however, thou hast a suffering friend, then be a resting- 
\par place for his suffering; like a hard bed, however, a camp-bed: 
\par thus wilt thou serve him best. 
\par 
\par And if a friend doeth thee wrong, then say: "I forgive thee 
\par what thou hast done unto me; that thou hast done it unto 
\par thyself, however how could I forgive that!" 
\par 
\par Thus speaketh all great love: it surpasseth even forgiveness 
\par and pity. 
\par 
\par One should hold fast one s heart; for when one lecteth it go, 
\par how quickly doth one s head run away! 
\par 
\par Ah, where in the world have th^ r ~ been greater follies than 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 96 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par with the pitiful? And what in the world hath caused more 
\par suffering than the follies of the pitiful? 
\par 
\par Woe unto all loving ones who have not an elevation which 
\par is above their pity! 
\par 
\par Thus spake the devil unto me, once on a time: "Even God 
\par hath his hell: it is his love for man." 
\par 
\par And lately, did I hear him say these words: "God is dead: 
\par of his pity for man hath God died."- 
\par 
\par So be ye warned against pity: from thence there yet cometh 
\par unto men a heavy cloud! Verily, I understand weather-signs! 
\par 
\par But attend also to this word : All great love is above all its 
\par pity: for it seeketh to create what is loved! 
\par 
\par "Myself do I offer unto my love, and my neighbour as my 
\par self such is the language of all creators. 
\par 
\par All creators, however, are hard. 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 26. The Priests 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AND one day Zarathustra made a sign to his disciples and spake 
\par these words unto them : 
\par 
\par "Here are priests: but although they are mine enemies, pass 
\par them quietly and with sleeping swords! 
\par 
\par Even among them there are heroes; many of them have 
\par suffered too much: so they want to make others suffer. 
\par 
\par Bad enemies are they: nothing is more revengeful than theii 
\par meekness. And readily doth he soil himself who toucheth 
\par them. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE PRIESTS 97 
\par 
\par But my blood is related to theirs; and I want withal to see 
\par rny blood honoured in theirs. "- 
\par 
\par And when they had passed, a pain attacked Zarathustra; 
\par but not long had he struggled with the pain, when he began 
\par to speak thus : 
\par 
\par It moveth my heart for those priests. They also go against 
\par my taste; but that is the smallest matter unto me, since I am 
\par among men. 
\par 
\par But I suffer ana have suffered with them: prisoners are they 
\par unto me, and stigmatised ones. He whom they call Saviour put 
\par them in fetters: 
\par 
\par In fetters of false values and fatuous words! Oh, that some 
\par one would save them from their Saviour! 
\par 
\par On an isle they once thought they had landed, when the sea 
\par tossed them about; but behold, it was a slumbering monster! 
\par 
\par False values and fatuous words: these are the worst mon 
\par sters for mortals long slumbereth and waiteth the fate that is 
\par in them. 
\par 
\par But at last it cometh and awaketh and devoureth and en- 
\par gulfeth whatever hath built tabernacles upon it. 
\par 
\par Oh, just look at those tabernacles which those priests have 
\par built themselves! Churches, they call their sweet-smelling 
\par caves! 
\par 
\par Oh, that falsified light, that mustified air! Where the soul 
\par may not fly aloft to its height! 
\par 
\par But so enjoineth their belief: ^On your knees, up the stair, 
\par ye sinners!" 
\par 
\par Verily, rather would I see a shameless one than the dis 
\par torted eyes of their shame and devotion! 
\par 
\par Who created for themselves such caves and penitence- 
\par stairs? Was it not those who sought to conceal themselves, and 
\par were ashamed under the clear sky? 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 98 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par And only when the clear sky looketh again through ruined 
\par roofs, and down upon grass and red poppies on ruined walls 
\par will I again turn my heart to the seats of this God. 
\par 
\par They called God that which opposed and afflicted them: and 
\par verily, there was much hero-spirit in their worship! 
\par 
\par And they knew not how to love their God otherwise than 
\par by nailing men to the cross! 
\par 
\par As corpses they thought to live; in black draped they their 
\par corpses; even in their talk do I still feel the evil flavour of 
\par charnel-houses. 
\par 
\par And he who liveth nigh unto them liveth nigh unto black 
\par pools, wherein the toad singeth his song with sweet gravity. 
\par 
\par Better songs would they have to sing, for me to believe in 
\par their Saviour: more like saved ones would his disciples have 
\par to appear unto me! 
\par 
\par Naked, would I like to see them: for beauty alone should 
\par preach penitence. But whom would that disguised affliction 
\par convince! 
\par 
\par Verily, their saviours themselves came not from freedom 
\par and freedom s seventh heaven! Verily, they themselves never 
\par trod the carpets of knowledge! 
\par 
\par Of defects did the spirit of those saviours consist; but into 
\par every defect had they put their illusion, their stop-gap, which 
\par they called God. 
\par 
\par In their pity was their spirit drowned; and when they 
\par swelled and o erswelled with pity, there always floated to the 
\par surface a great folly. 
\par 
\par Eagerly arid with shouts drove they their flock over their 
\par foot-bridge; as if there were but one foot-bridge to the future! 
\par Verily, those shepherds also were still of the flock! 
\par 
\par Small spirits and spacious souls had those shepherds: but, 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THEVIRTUOUS 99 
\par 
\par my brethren, what small domains have even the most spacious 
\par souls hitherto been! 
\par 
\par Characters of blood did they write on the way they went, and 
\par their folly taught that truth is proved by blood. 
\par 
\par But blood is the very worst witness to truth; blood tainteth 
\par the purest teaching, and turneth it into delusion and hatred 
\par of heart. 
\par 
\par And when a person goeth through fire for his teaching 
\par what doth that prove! It is more, verily, when out of one s own 
\par burning cometh one s own teaching! 
\par 
\par Sultry heart and cold head; where these meet, there ariseth 
\par the blusterer, the "Saviour." 
\par 
\par Greater ones, verily, have there been, and higher-born ones, 
\par than those whom the people call saviours, those rapturous 
\par blusterers! 
\par 
\par And by still greater ones than any of the saviours must ye 
\par be saved, my brethren, if ye would find the way to freedom! 
\par 
\par Never yet hath there been a Superman. Naked have I seen 
\par both of them, the greatest man and the smallest man: 
\par 
\par All-too-similar are they still to each other. Verily, even the 
\par greatest found I all-too-human! 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 27. The Virtuous 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WITH thunder and heavenly fireworks must one speak to in 
\par dolent and somnolent senses. 
\par 
\par But beauty s voice speaketh gently: it appealeth only to the 
\par most awakened souls. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 100 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Gently vibrated and laughed unto me to-day my buckler; it 
\par was beauty s holy laughing and thrilling. 
\par 
\par At you, ye virtuous ones, laughed my beauty to-day. And 
\par thus came its voice unto me: "They want to be paid besides!" 
\par 
\par Ye want to be paid besides, ye virtuous ones! Ye want re 
\par ward for virtue, and heaven for earth, and eternity for your to 
\par day? 
\par 
\par And now ye upbraid me for teaching that there is no reward- 
\par giver, nor paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that 
\par virtue is its own reward. 
\par 
\par Ah! this is my sorrow: into the basis of things have reward 
\par and punishment been insinuated and now even into the 
\par basis of your souls, ye virtuous ones! 
\par 
\par But like the snout of the boar shall my word grub up the 
\par basis of your souls; a ploughshare will I be called by you. 
\par 
\par All the secrets of your heart shall be brought to light; and 
\par when ye lie in the sun, grubbed up and broken, then will also 
\par your falsehood be separated from your truth. 
\par 
\par For this is your truth: ye are too pure for the filth of the 
\par words: vengeance, punishment, recompense, retribution. 
\par 
\par Ye love your virtue as a mother loveth her child; but when 
\par did one hear of a mother wanting to be paid for her love? 
\par 
\par It is your dearest Self, your virtue. The ring s thirst is in 
\par you: to reach itself again struggleth every ring, and turneth 
\par itself. 
\par 
\par And like the star that goeth out, so is every work of your 
\par virtue: ever is its light on its way and travelling and when 
\par will it cease to be on its way? 
\par 
\par Thus is the light of your virtue still on its way, even when 
\par its work is done. Be it forgotten and dead, still its ray of light 
\par liveth and travelleth. 
\par 
\par That your virtue is your Self, and not an outward thing, a 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE VIRTUOUS IOI 
\par 
\par skin, or a cloak : that is the truth from the basis of your souls, 
\par ye virtuous ones! 
\par 
\par But sure enough there are those to whom virtue meaneth 
\par writhing under the lash: and ye have hearkened too much unto 
\par their crying! 
\par 
\par And others are there who call virtue the slothfulness of 
\par their vices; and when once their hatred and jealousy relax the 
\par limbs, their "justice" becometh lively and rubbeth its sleepy 
\par eyes. 
\par 
\par And others are there who are drawn downwards: their 
\par devils draw them. But the more they sink, the more ardently 
\par gloweth their eye, and the longing for their God. 
\par 
\par Ah! their crying also hath reached your ears, ye virtuous 
\par ones: "What I am not, that, that is God to me, and virtue!" 
\par 
\par And others are there who go along heavily and creakingly, 
\par like carts taking stones downhill: they talk much of dignity 
\par and virtue their drag they call virtue! 
\par 
\par And others are there who are like eight-day clocks when 
\par wound up; they tick, and want people to call ticking virtue. 
\par 
\par Verily, in those have I mine amusement: wherever I find 
\par such clocks I shall wind them up with my mockery, and they 
\par shall even whirr thereby! 
\par 
\par And others are proud of their modicum of righteousness, 
\par and for the sake of it do violence to all things : so that the world 
\par is drowned in their unrighteousness. 
\par 
\par Ah! how ineptly cometh the word "virtue" out of their 
\par mouth! And when they say: "I am just," it always soundeth 
\par like: "I am just revenged!" 
\par 
\par With their virtues they want to scratch out the eyes of their 
\par enemies; and they elevate themselves only that they may lower 
\par others. 
\par 
\par And again there are those who sit in their swamp, and speak 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par IO2 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par thus from among the bulrushes: "Virtue that is to sit quietly 
\par in the swamp. 
\par 
\par We bite no one, and go out of the way of him who would 
\par bite; and in all matters we have the opinion that is given us." 
\par 
\par And again there are those who love attitudes, and think that 
\par virtue is a sort of attitude. 
\par 
\par Their knees continually adore, and their hands are eulogies 
\par of virtue, but their heart knoweth naught thereof. 
\par 
\par And again there are those who regard it as virtue to say: 
\par "Virtue is necessary"; but after all they believe only that police 
\par men are necessary. 
\par 
\par And many a one who cannot see men s loftiness, calleth it 
\par virtue to see their baseness far too well: thus calleth he his 
\par evil eye virtue. 
\par 
\par And some want to be edified and raised up, and call it 
\par virtue: and others want to be cast down, and likewise call 
\par it virtue. 
\par 
\par And thus do almost all think that they participate in virtue; 
\par and at least every one claimeth to be an authority on "good" 
\par and "evil." 
\par 
\par But Zarathustra came not to say unto all those liars and 
\par fools: "What do ye know of virtue! What could ye know of 
\par virtue !"- 
\par 
\par But that ye, my friends, might become weary of the old 
\par words which ye have learned from the fools and liars: 
\par 
\par That ye might become weary of the words "reward," "retri- 
\par oution," "punishment," "righteous vengeance." 
\par 
\par That ye might become weary of saying: "That an action is 
\par good is because it is unselfish." 
\par 
\par Ah! my friends! That your very Self be in your action, as 
\par the mother is in the child: let that be your formula of virtue! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE R AB BLE 103 
\par 
\par Verily, I have taken from you a hundred formulae and youi 
\par virtue s favourite playthings; and now ye upbraid me, as 
\par children upbraid. 
\par 
\par They played by the sea then came there a wave and swept 
\par their playthings into the deep: and now do they cry. 
\par 
\par But the same wave shall bring them new playthings, and 
\par spread before them new speckled shells! 
\par 
\par Thus will they be comforted; and like them shall ye also, my 
\par friends, have your comforting and new speckled shells! 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par s8. The Rabble 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par LIFE is a well of delight; but where the rabble also drink, 
\par there all fountains are poisoned. 
\par 
\par To everything cleanly am I well disposed; but I hate to see 
\par the grinning mouths and the thirst of the unclean. 
\par 
\par They cast their eye down into the fountain: and now 
\par glanceth up to me their odious smile out of the fountain. 
\par 
\par The holy water have they poisoned with their lustfulness; 
\par and when they called their filthy dreams delight, then poisoned 
\par they also the words. 
\par 
\par Indignant becometh the flame when they put their damp 
\par hearts to the fire; the spirit itself bubbleth and smoketh when 
\par the rabble approach the fire. 
\par 
\par Mawkish and over-mellow becometh the fruit in their 
\par hands: unsteady, and withered at the top, Hoth their look make 
\par the fruit-tree. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 104 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par And many a one who hath turned away from life, hath only 
\par turned away from the rabble: he hated to share with them 
\par fountain, flame, and fruit. 
\par 
\par And many a one who hath gone into the wilderness and 
\par suffered thirst with beasts of prey, disliked only to sit at the 
\par cistern with filthy camel-drivers. 
\par 
\par And many a one who hath come along as a destroyer, and 
\par as a hailstorm to all cornfields, wanted merely to put his foot 
\par into the jaws of the rabble, and thus stop their throat. 
\par 
\par And it is not the mouthful which hath most choked me, to 
\par know that life itself requireth enmity and death and torture- 
\par crosses: 
\par 
\par But I asked once, and suffocated almost with my question: 
\par What? Is the rabble also necessary for life? 
\par 
\par Are poisoned fountains necessary, and stinking fires, and 
\par filthy dreams, and maggots in the bread of life? 
\par 
\par Not my hatred, but my loathing, gnawed hungrily at my life! 
\par Ah, ofttimes became I weary of spirit, when I found even the 
\par rabble spiritual! 
\par 
\par And on the rulers turned I my back, when I saw what they 
\par now call ruling: to traffic and bargain for power with the 
\par rabble! 
\par 
\par Amongst peoples of a strange language did I dwell, with 
\par stopped ears: so that the language of their trafficking might 
\par remain strange unto me, and their bargaining for power. 
\par 
\par And holding my nose, I went morosely through all yester 
\par days and todays: verily, badly smell all yesterdays and todays 
\par of the scribbling rabble! 
\par 
\par Like a cripple become deaf, and blind, and dumb thus 
\par have I lived long; that I might not live with the power-rabble, 
\par the scribe-rabble, and the pleasure-rabble. 
\par 
\par Toilsomely did my spirit mount stairs, and cautiously ; alms 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE RABBLE 105 
\par 
\par of delight were its refreshment; on the staff did life creep 
\par along with the blind one. 
\par 
\par What hath happened unto me? How have I freed myself 
\par from loathing? Who hath rejuvenated mine eye? How have I 
\par flown to the height where no rabble any longer sit at the 
\par wetts? 
\par 
\par DiJ my loathing itself create for me wings and fountain- 
\par divining powers? Verily, to the loftiest height had I to fly, to 
\par find again the well of delight! 
\par 
\par Oh, I have found it, my brethren! Here on the loftiest height 
\par bubbleth up for me the well of delight! And there is a life at 
\par whose waters none of the rabble drink with me! 
\par 
\par Almost too violently dost thou flow for me, thou fountain 
\par of delight! And often emptiest thou the goblet again, in want 
\par ing to fill it! 
\par 
\par And yet must I learn to approach thee more modestly: far 
\par too violently doth my heart still flow towards thee: 
\par 
\par My heart on which my summer burneth, my short, hot, 
\par melancholy, over-happy summer: how my summer heart 
\par longeth for thy coolness! 
\par 
\par Past, the lingering distress of my spring! Past, the wicked 
\par ness of my snowflakes in June! Summer have I become entirely, 
\par and summer- noontide! 
\par 
\par A summer on the loftiest height, with cold fountains and 
\par blissful stillness: oh, come, my friends, that the stillness may 
\par become more blissful! 
\par 
\par For this is our height and our home: too high and steep do 
\par we here dwell for all uncleanly ones and their thirst. 
\par 
\par Cast but your pure eyes into the well of my delight, my 
\par friends! How could it become turbid thereby! It shall laugh 
\par back to you with its purity.

\par from behind your word "justice." 
\par 
\par Because, for man to be redeemed from revenge that is for 
\par me the bridge to the highest hope, and a rainbow after long 
\par storms. 
\par 
\par Otherwise, however, would the tarantulas have it. "Let it

\par 
\par In all their lamentations soundeth vengeance, in all their

\par 
\par But thus do I counsel you, my friends: distrust all in whom 
\par the impulse to punish is powerful! 
\par 
\par They are people of bad race and lineage; out of their coun

\par And when they call themselves "the good and just," forget

\par My friends, I will not be mixed up and confounded with 
\par others. 
\par 
\par There are those who preach my doctrine of life, and are at 
\par the same time preachers of equality, and tarantulas. 
\par 
\par That they speak in favour of life, though they sit in their 
\par den, these poison-spiders, and withdrawn from life is be 
\par cause they would thereby do injury. 
\par 
\par To those would they thereby do injury who have power at 
\par present : for with those the preaching of death is still most at 
\par home. 
\par 
\par Were it otherwise, then would the tarantulas teach other 
\par wise: and they themselves were formerly the best world- 
\par maligners and heretic-burners. 
\par 
\par With these preachers of equality will I not be mixed up and 
\par confounded. For thus speaketh justice unto me: "Men are not 
\par equal." 
\par 
\par And neither shall they become so! What would be my love

\par did they pay you reverence. 
\par 
\par And on that account also did they tolerate your unbelief, 
\par because it was a pleasantry and a by-path for the people. Thus 
\par doth the master give free scope to his slaves, and even en- 
\par joyeth their presumptuousness. 
\par 
\par But he who is hated by the people, as the wolf by the dogs 
\par is the free spirit, the enemy of fetters, the non-adorer, the 
\par dweller in the woods. 
\par 
\par To hunt him out of his lair that was always called "sense

\par sharpest-toothed dogs. 
\par 
\par "For there the truth is, where the people are! Woe, woe to

\par 
\par THE FAMOUS WISE ONES III 
\par 
\par Your people would ye justify in their reverence: that called 
\par ye "Will to Truth," ye famous wise ones! 
\par 
\par And your heart hath always said to itself: "From the people 
\par have I come: from thence carne to me also the voice of God." 
\par 
\par Stiff-necked and artful, like the ass, have ye always been, as 
\par the advocates of the people. 
\par 
\par And many a powerful one who wanted to run well with the 
\par people, hath harnessed in front of his horses a donkey, a 
\par famous wise man. 
\par 
\par And now, ye famous wise ones, I would have you finally 
\par throw off entirely the skin of the lion! 
\par 
\par The skin of the beast of prey, the speckled skin, and the 
\par dishevelled locks of the investigator, the searcher, and the con 
\par queror! 
\par 
\par Ah! for me to learn to believe in your "conscientiousness," 
\par ye would first have to break your venerating will. 
\par 
\par Conscientious so call I him who goeth into God-forsaken 
\par wildernesses, and hath broken his venerating heart. 
\par 
\par In the yellow sands and burnt by the sun, he doubtless 
\par peereth thirstily at the isles rich in fountains, where life re- 
\par poseth under shady trees. 
\par 
\par But his thirst doth not persuade him to become like those 
\par comfortable ones: for where there are oases, there are also 
\par idols. 
\par 
\par Hungry, fierce, lonesome, God-forsaken: so doth the lion- 
\par will wish itself. 
\par 
\par Free from the happiness of slaves, redeemed from deities 
\par and adorations, fearless and fear- inspiring, grand and lone 
\par some: so is the will of the conscientious. 
\par 
\par In the wilderness have ever dwelt the conscientious, the

\par 
\par Not that I on that account upbraid them: but serving ones 
\par do they remain, and harnessed ones, even though they glitter 
\par in golden harness. 
\par 
\par And often have they been good servants and worthy of their 
\par hire. For thus saith virtue: "If thou must be a servant, seek 
\par him unto whom thy service is most useful! 
\par 
\par The spirit and virtue of thy master shall advance by thou

\par 
\par And verily, ye famous wise ones, ye servants of the people!

\par 
\par But the people ye remain for me, even with your virtues, 
\par the people with purblind eyes the people who know not what

\par 
\par Spirit is life which itself cutteth into life: by its own torture 
\par doth it increase its own knowledge, did ye know that before? 
\par 
\par And the spirit s happiness is this: to be anointed and conse 
\par crated with tears as a sacrificial victim, did ye know that be

\par

\par groping, shall yet testify to the power of the sun into which 
\par he hath gazed, did ye know that before? 
\par 
\par And with mountains shall the discerning one learn to build! 
\par It is a small thing for the spirit to remove mountains, did ye 
\par know that before? 
\par 
\par Ye know only the sparks of the spirit: but ye do not see the 
\par anvil which it is, and the cruelty of its hammer! 
\par 
\par Verily, ye know not the spirit s pride! But still less could 
\par ye endure the spirit s humility, should it ever want to speak! 
\par 
\par And never yet could ye cast your spirit into a pit of snow:

\par 
\par In all respects, however, ye make too familiar with the spirit; 
\par and out of wisdom have ye often made an alms-house and a 
\par hospital for bad poets. 
\par 
\par Ye are not eagles : thus have ye never experienced the happi 
\par ness of the alarm of the spirit. And he who is not a bird should 
\par not camp above abysses.

\par which speaketh itself the language of love. 
\par 
\par Light am I: ah, that I were night! But it is my lonesomeness 
\par to be begirt with light! 
\par 
\par Ah, that I were dark and nightly! How would I suck at tne 
\par breasts of light! 
\par 
\par And you yourselves would I bless, ye twinkling starlets and 
\par glow-worms aloft! and would rejoice in the gifts of your 
\par light. 
\par 
\par But I live in mine own light, I drink again into myself the 
\par flames that break forth from me. 
\par 
\par I know not the happiness of the receiver; and oft have I 
\par dreamt that stealing must be more blessed than receiving. 
\par 
\par It is my poverty that my hand never ceaseth bestowing; it is 
\par mine envy that I see waiting eyes and the brightened nights of 
\par longing. 
\par 
\par Oh, the misery of all bestowers! Oh, the darkening of my 
\par sun! Oh, the craving to crave! Oh, the violent hunger in satiety! 
\par 
\par They take from me: but do I yet touch their soul? There is a 
\par gap twixt giving and receiving; and the smallest gap hath 
\par finally to be bridged over. 
\par 
\par A hunger ariseth out of my beauty: I should like to injure 
\par those I illumine; I should like to rob those I have gifted: 
\par thus do I hunger for wickedness. 
\par 
\par Withdrawing my hand when another hand already 
\par stretcheth out to it; hesitating like the cascade, which hesi-

\par 
\par Such revenge doth mine abundance think of: such mischief 
\par welleth out of my lonesomeness. 
\par

\par 
\par Whence have gone the tears of mine eye, and the down of

\par 
\par 32. The Dance-Song 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ONE evening went Zarathustra and his disciples through the 
\par forest; and when he sought for a well, lo, he lighted upon a 
\par green meadow peacefully surrounded by trees and bushes 
\par where maidens were dancing together. As soon as the maidens 
\par recognised Zarathustra, they ceased dancing; Zarathustra, how 
\par ever, approached them with friendly mien and spake these 
\par words : 
\par 
\par Cease not your dancing, ye lovely maidens! No game-spoiler 
\par hath come to you with evil eye, no enemy of maidens. 
\par 
\par God s advocate am I with the devil: he, however, is the 
\par spirit of gravity. How could I, ye light-footed ones, be hostile 
\par to divine dances? Or to maidens feet with fine ankles? 
\par 
\par To be sure, I am a forest, and a night of dark trees : but he 
\par who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses 
\par under my cypresses. 
\par 
\par And even the little God may he find, who is dearest to 
\par maidens: beside the well lieth he quietly, with closed eyes. 
\par 
\par Verily, in broad daylight did he fall asleep, the sluggard! 
\par Had he perhaps chased butterflies too much? 
\par 
\par Upbraid me not, ye beautiful dancers, when I chasten the 
\par little God somewhat! He will cry, certainly, and weep but 
\par he is laughable even when weeping! 
\par 
\par And with tears in his eyes shall he ask you for a dance; and 
\par I myself will sing a song to his dance: 
\par 
\par A dance-song and satire on the spirit of gravity my su- 
\par premest powerfulest devil, who is said to be "lord of the 
\par world." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE DANCE-SONG 
\par 
\par And this is the song that Zarathustra sang when Cupid and 
\par the maidens danced together: 
\par 
\par Of late did I gaze into thine eye, O Life! And into the un 
\par fathomable did I there seem to sink. 
\par 
\par But thou pulledst me out with a golden angle; derisively 
\par didst thou laugh when I called thee unfathomable. 
\par 
\par "Such is the language of all fish," saidst thou; "what they 
\par do not fathom is unfathomable. 
\par 
\par But changeable am I only, and wild, and altogether a 
\par woman, and no virtuous one: 
\par 
\par Though I be called by you men the profound one, or the 
\par faithful one, the eternal one, the mysterious one/ 
\par 
\par But ye men endow us always with your own virtues alas, 
\par ye virtuous ones!" 
\par 
\par Thus did she laugh, the unbelievable one; but never do I be 
\par lieve her and her laughter, when she speaktth evil of herself. 
\par 
\par And when I talked face to face with my wild Wisdom, she 
\par said to me angrily: "Thou wiliest, thou cravest, thou lovest; 
\par on that account alone dost thou praise Life!" 
\par 
\par Then had I almost answered indignantly and told the truth 
\par to the angry one; and one cannot answer more indignantly 
\par than when one "telleth the truth" to one s Wisdom. 
\par 
\par For thus do things stand with us three. In my heart do I love 
\par only Life and verily, most when I hate her! 
\par 
\par But that I am fond of Wisdom, and often too fond, is be 
\par cause she remindeth me very strongly of Life! 
\par 
\par She hath her eye, her laugh, and even her golden angle-rod: 
\par am I responsible for it that both are so alike? 
\par 
\par And when once Life asked me: "Who is she then, this Wis 
\par dom?" then said I eagerly: "Ah, yes! Wisdom! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Il8 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par One thirsteth for her and is not satisfied, one looketh 
\par through veils, one graspeth through nets. 
\par 
\par Is she beautiful? What do I know! But the oldest carps are 
\par still lured by her. 
\par 
\par Changeable is she, and wayward; often have I seen her bite 
\par her lip, and pass the comb against the grain of her hair. 
\par 
\par Perhaps she is wicked and false, and altogether a woman; 
\par but when she speaketh ill of herself, just then doth she seduce 
\par most." 
\par 
\par When I had said this unto Life, then laughed she mali 
\par ciously, and shut her eyes. Of whom dost thou speak?" said 
\par she. "Perhaps of me? 
\par 
\par And if thou wert right is it proper to say that in such wise 
\par to my face! But now, pray, speak also of thy Wisdom!" 
\par 
\par Ah, and now hast thou again opened thine eyes, O beloved 
\par Life! And into the unfathomable have I again seemed to 
\par sink. 
\par 
\par Thus sang Zarathustra. But when the dance was over and 
\par the maidens had departed, he became sad. 
\par 
\par "The sun hath been long set," said he at last, "the meadow 
\par is damp, and from the forest cometh coolness. 
\par 
\par An unknown presence is about me, and gazeth thoughtfully. 
\par What! Thou livest still, Zarathustra? 
\par 
\par Why? Wherefore? Whereby? Whither? Where? How? Is 
\par it not folly still to live? 
\par 
\par Ah, my friends; the evening is it which thus interrogated! in 
\par me. Forgive me my sadness! 
\par 
\par Evening hath come on: forgive me that evening hath come 
\par on!" 
\par 
\par Thus sang Zarathustra.

\par "YONDER is the grave-island, the silent isle; yonder also are

\par 
\par Resolving thus in my heart, did I sail o er the sea. 
\par 
\par Oh, ye sights and scenes of my youth! Oh, all ye gleams of

\par for me! I think of you to-day as my dead ones. 
\par 
\par From you, my dearest dead ones, cometh unto me a sweet

\par openeth the heart of the lone seafarer. 
\par 
\par Still am I the richest and most to be envied I, the lone-

\par

\par And they hit it! Because ye were always my dearest, my

\par 
\par At my most vulnerable point did they shoot the arrow 
\par namely, at you, whose skin is like down or more like the 
\par smile that dieth at a glance! 
\par 
\par But this word will I say unto mine enemies: What is all man

\par THE GRAVE-SONG 121 
\par 
\par All loathing did I once vow to renounce: then did ye change 
\par my nigh ones and nearest ones into ulcerations. Ah, whither 
\par did my noblest vow then flee? 
\par 
\par As a blind one did I once walk in blessed ways: then did ye 
\par cast filth on the blind one s course: and now is he disgusted 
\par with the old footpath. 
\par 
\par And when I performed my hardest task, and celebrated the 
\par triumph of my victories, then did ye make those who loved me 
\par call out that I then grieved them most. 
\par 
\par Verily, it was always your doing: ye embittered to me my 
\par best honey, and the diligence of my best bees. 
\par 
\par To my charity have ye ever sent the most impudent beggars; 
\par around my sympathy have ye ever crowded the incurably 
\par shameless. Thus have ye wounded the faith of my virtue. 
\par 
\par And when I offered my holiest as a sacrifice, immediately 
\par did your "piety" put its fatter gifts beside it: so that my holiest 
\par suffocated in the fumes of your fat. 
\par 
\par And once did I want to dance as I had never yet danced : be 
\par yond all heavens did I want to dance. Then did ye seduce my 
\par favourite minstrel. 
\par 
\par And now hath he struck up an awful, melancholy air; alas, 
\par he tooted as a mournful horn to mine ear! 
\par 
\par Murderous minstrel, instrument of evil, most innocent in 
\par strument! Already did I stand prepared for the best dance: then 
\par didst thou slay my rapture with thy tones! 
\par 
\par Only in the dance do I know how to speak the parable of 
\par the highest things: and now hath my grandest parable re 
\par mained unspoken in my limbs! 
\par 
\par Unspoken and unrealised hath my highest hope remained! 
\par And there have perished for me all the visions and consolations 
\par of my youth! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 122 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par How did I ever bear it? How did I survive and surmount 
\par such wounds? How did my soul rise again out of those sepul 
\par chres? 
\par 
\par Yea, something invulnerable, unburiable is with me, some 
\par thing that would rend rocks asunder: it is called my Will. 
\par Silently doth it proceed, and unchanged throughout the years. 
\par 
\par Its course will it go upon my feet, mine old Will; hard of 
\par heart is its nature and invulnerable. 
\par 
\par Invulnerable am I only in my heel. Ever livest thou there, 
\par and art like thyself, thou most patient one! Ever hast thou 
\par burst all shackles of the tomb! 
\par 
\par In thee still liveth also the unrealisedness of my youth; and 
\par as life and youth sittest thou here hopeful on the yellow ruins 
\par of graves. 
\par 
\par Yea, thou art still for me the demolisher of all graves : Hail 
\par to thee, my Will! And only where there are graves are there 
\par resurrections. 
\par 
\par Thus sang Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par . Self-Surpassing 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par "WiLL to Truth" do ye call it, ye wisest ones, that which im- 
\par pelleth you and maketh you ardent? 
\par 
\par Will for the thinkableness of all being: thus do I call your 
\par will! 
\par 
\par All being would ye make thinkable: for ye doubt with good 
\par reason whether it be already thinkable. 
\par 
\par But it shall accommodate and bend itself to you! So willetb 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par SELF-SURPASSING 12 3 
\par 
\par your will. Smooth shall it become and subject to the spirit, as 
\par its mirror and reflection. 
\par 
\par That is your entire will, ye wisest ones, as a Will to Power; 
\par and even when ye speak of good and evil, and of estimates of 
\par value. 
\par 
\par Ye would still create a world before which ye can bow the 
\par knee: such is your ultimate hope and ecstasy. 
\par 
\par The ignorant, to be sure, the people they are like a river 
\par on which a boat floateth along: and in the boat sit the estimates 
\par of value, solemn and disguised. 
\par 
\par Your will and your valuations have ye put on the river of 
\par becoming; it betrayeth unto me an old Will to Power, what is 
\par believed by the people as good and evil. 
\par 
\par It was ye, ye wisest ones, who put such guests in this boat, 
\par and gave them pomp and proud names ye and your ruling 
\par Will! 
\par 
\par Onward the river now carrieth your boat: it must carry it. A 
\par small matter if the rough wave f oameth and angrily resisteth 
\par its keel! 
\par 
\par It is not the river that is your danger and the end of your 
\par good and evil, ye wisest ones: but that Will itself, the Will to 
\par Power the unexhausted, procreating life-will. 
\par 
\par But that ye may understand my gospel of good and evil, for 
\par that purpose will I tell you my gospel of life, and of the nature 
\par of all living things. 
\par 
\par The living thing did I follow; I walked in the broadest and 
\par narrowest paths to lea rn its nature. 
\par 
\par With a hundred-faced mirror did I catch its glance when its 
\par mouth was shut, so that its eye might speak unto me. And its 
\par eye spake unto me. 
\par 
\par But wherever I found living things, there heard I also the 
\par language of obedience. All living things are obeying things. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 124 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par And this heard I secondly: Whatever cannot obey itself, is 
\par commanded. Such is the nature of living things. 
\par 
\par This, however, is the third thing which I heard namely, 
\par that commanding is more difficult than obeying. And not only 
\par because the commander beareth the burden of all obeyers, and 
\par because this burden readily crusheth him: 
\par 
\par An attempt and a risk seemed all commanding unto me; and 
\par whenever it commandeth, the living thing risketh itself there- 
\par by. 
\par 
\par Yea, even when it commandeth itself, then also must it 
\par atone for its commanding. Of its own law must it become the 
\par judge and avenger and victim. 
\par 
\par How doth this happen! So did I ask myself. What persuadeth 
\par the living thing to obey, and command, and even be obedient in 
\par commanding? 
\par 
\par Hearken now unto my word, ye wisest ones! Test it seri 
\par ously, whether I have crept into the heart of life itself, and into 
\par the roots of its heart! 
\par 
\par Wherever I found a living thing, there found I Will to 
\par Power; and even in the will of the servant found I the will to 
\par be master. 
\par 
\par That to the stronger the weaker shall serve thereto per 
\par suadeth he his will who would be master over a still weaker 
\par one. That delight alone he is unwilling to forego. 
\par 
\par And as the lesser surrendereth himself to the greater that 
\par he may have delight and power over the least of all, so doth 
\par even the greatest surrender himself, and staketh life, for the 
\par sake of power. 
\par 
\par It is the surrender of the greatest to run risk and danger, 
\par and play dice for death. 
\par 
\par And where there is sacrifice and service and love-glances, 
\par there also is the will to be master. By by-ways doth the weaker 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par SELF-SURPASSING 125 
\par 
\par then slink into the fortress, and into the heart of the mightier 
\par one and there stealeth power. 
\par 
\par And this secret spake Life herself unto me. "Behold," said 
\par she, "I am that which must ever surpass itself. 
\par 
\par To be sure, ye call it will to procreation, or impulse towards 
\par a goal, towards the higher, remoter, more manifold: but all 
\par that is one and the same secret. 
\par 
\par Rather would I succumb than disown this one thing; and 
\par verily, where there is succumbing and leaf-falling, lo, there 
\par doth Life sacrifice itself for power! 
\par 
\par That I have to be struggle, and becoming, and purpose, and 
\par cross-purpose ah, he who divineth my will, divineth well also 
\par on what crooked paths it hath to tread! 
\par 
\par Whatever I create, and however much I love it, soon must 
\par I be adverse to it, and to my love: so willeth my will. 
\par 
\par And even thou, discerning one, art only a path and foot 
\par step of my will : verily, my Will to Power walketh even on the 
\par feet of thy Will to Truth! 
\par 
\par He certainly did not hit the truth who shot at it the 
\par formula: "Will to existence": that will doth not exist! 
\par 
\par For what is not, cannot will; that, however, which is in 
\par existence how could it still strive for existence! 
\par 
\par Only where there is life, is there also will: not, however, 
\par Will to Life, but so teach I thee Will to Power! 
\par 
\par Much is reckoned higher than life itself by the living one; 
\par but out of the very reckoning speaketh the Will to 
\par Power !"- 
\par 
\par Thus did Life once teach me: and thereby, ye wisest ones, 
\par do I solve you the riddle of your hearts. 
\par 
\par Verily, I say unto you: good and evil which would be ever 
\par lastingit doth not exist! Of its own accord must it evet 
\par surpass itself anew. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 126 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par With your values and formulae of good and evil, ye exercise 
\par power, ye valuing ones: and that is your secret love, and the 
\par sparkling, trembling, and overflowing of your souls. 
\par 
\par But a stronger power groweth out of your values, and a new 
\par surpassing: by it breaketh egg and egg-shell. 
\par 
\par And he who hath to be a creator in good and evil verily, 
\par he hath first to be a destroyer, and break values in pieces. 
\par 
\par Thus doth the greatest evil pertain to the greatest good: 
\par that, however, is the creating good. 
\par 
\par Let us speak thereof, ye wisest ones, even though it be bad. 
\par To be silent is worse; all suppressed truths become poisonous. 
\par 
\par And let everything break up which can break up by our 
\par truths! Many a house is still to be built!

\par 
\par A sublime one saw I today, a solemn one, a penitent of the 
\par spirit: Oh, how my soul laughed at his ugliness! 
\par 
\par With upraised breast, and like those who draw in their 
\par breath: thus did he stand, the sublime one, and in silence: 
\par 
\par O erhung with ugly truths, the spoil of his hunting, and

\par saw no rose. 
\par 
\par

\par Not yet had he learned laughing and beauty. Gloomy did 
\par this hunter return from the forest of knowledge. 
\par 
\par From the fight with wild beasts returned he home: but even 
\par yet a wild beast gazeth out of his seriousness an unconquered 
\par wild beast! 
\par 
\par As a tiger doth he ever stand, on the point of springing; but 
\par I do not like those strained souls; ungracious is my taste to 
\par wards all those self -engrossed ones. 
\par 
\par And ye tell me, friends, that there is to be no dispute about 
\par taste and tasting? But all life is a dispute about taste and 
\par tasting! 
\par 
\par Taste: that is weight at the same time, and scales and 
\par weigher; and alas for every living thing that would live with 
\par out dispute about weight and scales and weigher! 
\par 
\par Should he become weary of his sublimeness, this sublime 
\par one, then only will his beauty begin and then only will I taste 
\par him and find him savoury. 
\par 
\par And only when he turneth away from himself will he 
\par o erleap his own shadow and verily! into his sun. 
\par 
\par Far too long did he sit in the shade; the cheeks of the peni 
\par tent of the spirit became pale; he almost starved on his expec 
\par tations. 
\par 
\par Contempt is still in his eye, and loathing hideth in his 
\par mouth. To be sure, he now resteth, but he hath not yet taken 
\par rest in the sunshine. 
\par 
\par As the ox ought he to do; and his happiness should smell of 
\par the earth, and not of contempt for the earth , 
\par 
\par As a white ox would I like to see him, which, snorting and 
\par lowing, walketh before the plough-share: and his lowing 
\par should also laud all that is earthly! 
\par

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 128 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par His deed itself is still the shadow upon him: his doing 
\par obscureth the doer. Not yet hath he overcome his deed. 
\par 
\par To be sure, I love in him the shoulders of the ox : but now 
\par do I want to see also the eye of the angel. 
\par 
\par Also his hero- will hath he still to unlearn: an exalted one 
\par shall he be, and not only a sublime one: the ether itself 
\par should raise him, the will-less one! 
\par 
\par He hath subdued monsters, he hath solved enigmas. But 
\par he should also redeem his monsters and enigmas; into heavenly 
\par children should he transform them. 
\par 
\par As yet hath his knowledge not learned to smile, and to be 
\par without jealousy; as yet hath his gushing passion not become 
\par calm in beauty. 
\par 
\par Verily, not in satiety shall his longing cease and disappear, 
\par but in beauty! Gracefulness belongeth to the munificence of 
\par the magnanimous. 
\par 
\par His arm across his head : thus should the hero repose; thus 
\par should he also surmount his repose. 
\par 
\par But precisely to the hero is beauty the hardest thing of all. 
\par Unattainable is beauty by all ardent wills. 
\par 
\par A little more, a little less : precisely this is much here, it is 
\par the most here. 
\par 
\par To stand with relaxed muscles and with unharnessed will: 
\par that is the hardest for all of you, ye sublime ones! 
\par 
\par When power becometh gracious and descendeth into the

\par 
\par And from no one do I want beauty so much as from thee,

\par 
\par But I came nigh unto you : then came to me the day, and

\par 
\par See there! Surprised and pale doth it stand before the

\par 
\par For already she cometh, the glowing one, her love to the 
\par earth cometh! Innocence, and creative desire, is all solar love! 
\par 
\par See there, how she cometh impatiently over the sea! Do ye 
\par not feel the thirst and the hot breath of her love? 
\par 
\par At the sea would she suck, and drink its depths to her height:

\par 
\par Kissed and sucked would it be by the thirst of the sun; 
\par vapour would it become, and height, and path of light, and

\par 
\par Verily, like the sun do I love life, and all deep seas. 
\par 
\par And this meaneth to me knowledge: all that is deep shall

\par

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHEN I lay asleep, then did a sheep eat at the ivy-wreath on 
\par my head, it ate, and said thereby: "Zarathustra is no longer a 
\par scholar." 
\par 
\par It said this, and \\ver/t away clumsily and proudly. A chile?

\par 
\par I like to lie here where the children play, beside the ruiaed 
\par wall, among thistles and red poppies. 
\par 
\par A scholar am I still to the children, and also to the thistles 
\par ?ind red poppies. Innocent are they, even in their wickedness. 
\par 
\par But to the sheep I am no longer a scholar; so willeth my lot 
\par -blessings upon it! 
\par 
\par For this is the truth: I have departed from the house of 
\par the scholars, and the door have I also slammed behind me. 
\par 
\par Too long did my soul sit hungry at their table: not like them 
\par have I got the knack of investigating, as the knack of nut- 
\par cracking. 
\par 
\par Freedom do I love, and the air over fresh soil; rather would 
\par I sleep on ox-skins than on their honours and dignities. 
\par 
\par I am too hot and scorched with mine own thought : often is 
\par it ready to take away my breath. Then have I to go into the 
\par open air, and away from all dusty rooms. 
\par 
\par But they sit cool in the cool shade: they want in everything 
\par \\;o be merely spectators, and they avoid sitting where the sun 
\par burneth on the steps. 
\par 
\par Like those who stand in the street and gape at the passers-by: 
\par thus do they also wait, and gape at the thoughts which others 
\par have thought. 
\par 
\par Should one lay hold of them, then do they raise a dust like 
\par flour-sacks, and involuntarily: but who would divine that their 
\par dust came from corn, and from the yellow delight of the sum 
\par mer fields? 
\par 
\par When they give themselves out as wise, then do their petty 
\par sayings and truths chill me: in their wisdom there is often an 
\par odour as if it came from the swamp; ana verily, I have eveiv 
\par heard the frog croak in it! 
\par 
\par Clever are they they have dexterous fingers: what aom my 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par SCHOLARS 137 
\par 
\par simplicity pretend to beside their multiplicity! All threading 
\par and knitting and weaving do their fingers understand : thus do 
\par they make the hose of the spirit! 
\par 
\par Good clockworks are they: only be careful to wind them up 
\par properly! Then do they indicate the hour without mistake, and 
\par make a modest noise thereby. 
\par 
\par Like millstones do they work, and like pestles : throw only 
\par seed-corn unto them! they know well how to grind corn 
\par small, and make white dust out of it. 
\par 
\par They keep a sharp eye on one another, and do not trust each 
\par other the best. Ingenious in little artifices, they wait for those 
\par whose knowledge walketh on lame feet, like spiders do they 
\par wait. 
\par 
\par I saw them always prepare their poison with precaution; 
\par and always did they put glass gloves on their fingers in doing 
\par so. 
\par 
\par They also know how to play with false dice; and so eagerly 
\par did I find them playing, that they perspired thereby. 
\par 
\par We are alien to each other, and their virtues are even more 
\par repugnant to my taste than their falsehoods and false dice. 
\par 
\par And when I lived with them, then did I live above them. 
\par Therefore did they take a dislike to me. 
\par 
\par They want to hear nothing of any one walking above their 
\par heads; and so they put wood and earth and rubbish betwixt me 
\par and their heads. 
\par 
\par Thus did they deafen the sound of my tread : and least have 
\par I hitherto been heard by the most learned. 
\par 
\par All mankind s faults and weaknesses did they put betwixt 
\par themselves and me: they call it "false ceiling" in their 
\par houses. 
\par 
\par But nevertheless I walk with my thoughts above their heads; 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 138 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par and even should I walk on mine own errors, still would I be 
\par above them and their heads. 
\par 
\par For men are not equal: so speaketh justice. And what I will, 
\par they may not will! 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par . Poets 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par M SiNCE I have known the body better" said Zarathustra tc 
\par one of his disciples "the spirit hath only been to me sym 
\par bolically spirit; and all the imperishable that is also but a 
\par simile." 
\par 
\par "So have I heard thee say once before," answered the dis 
\par ciple, "and then thou addedst: But the poets lie too much. 
\par Why didst thou say that the poets lie too much?" 
\par 
\par "Why?" said Zarathustra. "Thou askest why? I do not 
\par belong to those who may be asked after their Why. 
\par 
\par Is my experience but of yesterday? It is long ago that I ex 
\par perienced the reasons for mine opinions. 
\par 
\par Should I not have to be a cask of memory, if I also wanted to 
\par have my reasons with me? 
\par 
\par It is already too much for me even to retain mine opinions; 
\par and many a bird flieth away. 
\par 
\par And sometimes, also, do I find a fugitive creature in my 
\par dovecote, which is alien to me, and trembleth when I lay my 
\par hand upon it. 
\par 
\par But what did Zarathustra once say unto thee? That the poets 
\par lie too much? But Zarathustra also is a poet. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par POETS 139 
\par 
\par Believest thou that he there spake the truth? Why dost thou 
\par believe it?" 
\par 
\par The disciple answered: "I believe in Zarathustra." But 
\par Zarathustra shook his head and smiled. 
\par 
\par Belief doth not sanctify me, said he, leas*- of all the beliet 
\par in myself. 
\par 
\par But granting that some one did say in all seriousness that the 
\par poets lie too much: he was right we do lie too much. 
\par 
\par We also know too little, and are bad learners: so we are 
\par obliged to lie. 
\par 
\par And which of us poets hath not adulterated his wine? Many 
\par a poisonous hotchpotch hath evolved in our cellars : many an 
\par indescribable thing hath there been done. 
\par 
\par And because we know little, therefore are we pleased from 
\par the heart with the poor in spirit, especially when they are 
\par young women! 
\par 
\par And even of those things are we desirous, which old women 
\par tell one another in the evening. This do we call the eternally 
\par feminine in us. 
\par 
\par And as if there were a special secret access to knowledge, 
\par which choketh up for those who learn anything, so do we 
\par believe in the people and in their "wisdom." 
\par 
\par This, however, do all poets believe: that whoever pricketh 
\par up his ears when lying in the grass or on lonely slopes, learneth 
\par something of the things that are betwixt heaven and earth. 
\par 
\par And if there come unto them tender emotions, then do the 
\par poets always think that nature herself is in love with them : 
\par 
\par And that she stealeth to their ear to whisper secrets into it, 
\par and amorous flatteries: of this do they plume and pride them 
\par selves, before all mortals! 
\par 
\par Ah, f here are so many things betwixt heaven and earth of 
\par which only the poets have dreamed! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 140 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par And especially above the heavens: for all gods are poet- 
\par symbolisations, poet-sophistications! 
\par 
\par Verily, ever are we drawn aloft that is, to the realm of the 
\par clouds: on th^se do we set our gaudy puppets, and then call 
\par them gods and Supermen: 
\par 
\par Are not they light enough for those chairs! all these gods 
\par and Supermen? 
\par 
\par Ah, how I am weary of all the inadequate that is insisted on 
\par as actual! Ah, how I am weary of the poets! 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra so spake, his disciple resented it, but 
\par was silent. And Zarathustra also was silent; and his eye 
\par directed itself inwardly, as if it gazed into the far distance. At 
\par last he sighed and drew breath. 
\par 
\par I am of today and heretofore, said he thereupon; but some 
\par thing is in me that is of the morrow, and the day following, 
\par and the hereafter. 
\par 
\par I became weary of the poets, of the old and of the new: 
\par superficial are they all unto me, and shallow seas. 
\par 
\par They did not think sufficiently into the depth; therefore their 
\par feeling did not reach to the bottom. 
\par 
\par Some sensation of voluptuousness and some sensation of 
\par tedium: these have as yet been their best contemplation. 
\par 
\par Ghost-breathing and ghost-whisking, seemeth to me all the 
\par jingle- jangling of their harps; what have the\} 7 known hitherto 
\par of the fervour of tones! 
\par 
\par They are also not pure enough for me: they all muddle their 
\par water that it may seem deep. 
\par 
\par And fain would they thereby prove themselves reconcilers: 
\par but mediaries and mixers are they unto me, and half-and-half, 
\par and impure! 
\par 
\par Ah, I cast indeed my net into thei r sea, and meant to catch

\par 
\par 
\par POETS 141

\par good fish; but always did I draw up the head of some ancient 
\par God. 
\par 
\par Thus did the sea give a stone to the hungry one. And they

\par 
\par Certainly, one findeth pearls in them; thereby they are the 
\par more like hard molluscs. And instead of a. soul, I have often 
\par found in them salt slime. 
\par 
\par They have learned from the sea also its vanity: is not the 
\par sea the peacock of peacocks? 
\par 
\par Even before the ugliest of all buffaloes doth it spread out 
\par its tail; never doth it tire of its lace-fan of silver and silk. 
\par 
\par Disdainfully doth the buffalo glance thereat, nigh to the 
\par sand with its soul, nigher still to the thicket, nighest, however, 
\par to the swamp. 
\par 
\par What is beauty and sea and peacock-splendour to it! This 
\par parable I speak unto the poets. 
\par 
\par Verily, their spirit itself is the peacock of peacocks, and a 
\par sea of vanity! 
\par 
\par Spectators seeketh the spirit of the poet should they even 
\par be buffaloes! 
\par 
\par But of this spirit became I weary; and I see the time coming 
\par when it will become weary of itself. 
\par 
\par Yea, changed have I seen the poets, and their glance turned

\par THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par 40. Great Events 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THERE is an isle in the sea not far from the Happy Isles of 
\par Zarathustra on which a volcano ever smoketh; of which isle 
\par the people, and especially the old women amongst them, say 
\par that it is placed as a rock before the gate of the nether- world; 
\par but that through the volcano itself the narrow way leadeth 
\par downwards which conducteth to this gate. 
\par 
\par Now about the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the 
\par Happy Isles, it happened that a ship anchored at the isle on 
\par which standeth the smoking mountain, and the crew went 
\par ishore to shoot rabbits. About the noontide hour, however. 
\par when the captain and his men were together again, they saw 
\par suddenly a man coming towards them through the air, and a 
\par voice said distinctly: "It is time! It is the highest time!" But 
\par when the figure was nearest to them (it flew past quickly, how 
\par ever, like a shadow, in the direction of the volcano) , then did 
\par they recognise with the greatest surprise that it was Zarathus* 
\par tra; for they had all seen him before except the captain himself, 
\par and they loved him as the people love: in such wise that love 
\par and awe were combined in equal degree. 
\par 
\par "Behold!" said the old helmsman, "there goeth Zarathustra 
\par to hell!" 
\par 
\par About the same time that these sailors landed on the fire- 
\par isle, there was a rumour that Zarathustra had disappeared; and 
\par when his friends were asked about it, they said that he had 
\par gone on board a ship by night, without saying whither he was 
\par going. 
\par 
\par Thus there arose some uneasiness. After three days, how 
\par ever, there came the story of the ship s crew in addition to this 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par GREAT EVENTS 143 
\par 
\par uneasiness and then did ail the people say that the devil had 
\par taken Zarathustra. His disciples laughed, sure enough, at this 
\par talk; and one of them said even: "Sooner would I believe that 
\par Zarathustra hath taken the devil." But at the bottom of their 
\par hearts they were all full of anxiety and longing: so their joy 
\par was great when on the fifth day Zarathustra appeared amongst 
\par them. 
\par 
\par And this is the account of Zarathustra s interview with the 
\par fire-dog: 
\par 
\par The earth, said he, hath a skin; and this skin hath diseases. 
\par One of these diseases, for example, is called "man." 
\par 
\par And another of these diseases is called "the fire-dog": con 
\par cerning him men have greatly deceived themselves, and let 
\par themselves be deceived. 
\par 
\par To fathom this mystery did I go o er the sea; and I have 
\par seen the truth naked, verily! barefooted up to the neck. 
\par 
\par Now do I know how it is concerning the fire-dog; and 
\par likewise concerning all the spouting and subversive devils, of 
\par which not only old women are afraid. 
\par 
\par "Up with thee, fire-dog, out of thy depth!" cried I, "and 
\par confess how deep that depth is! Whence cometh that which 
\par thou snortest up? 
\par 
\par Thou drinkest copiously at the sea: that doth thine embit 
\par tered eloquence betray! In sooth, for a dog of the depth, thou 
\par takest thy nourishment too much from the surface! 
\par 
\par At the most, I regard thee as the ventriloquist of the earth: 
\par and ever, when 1 have heard subversive and spouting devils 
\par speak, I have found them like thee: embittered, mendacious, 
\par and shallow. 
\par 
\par Ye understand how to roar and obscure with ashes! Ye are 
\par trie best braggarts, and have sufficiently learned the art of 
\par makir.g dregs boil. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 144 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Where ye are, there must always be dregs at hand, and much 
\par that is spongy, hollow, and compressed: it wanteth to have 
\par freedom. 
\par 
\par Freedom ye all roar most eagerly: but I have unlearned the 
\par belief in great events/ when there is much roaring and smoke 
\par about them. 
\par 
\par And believe me, friend Hullabaloo! The greatest events 
\par are not our noisiest, but our stillest hours. 
\par 
\par Not around the inventors of new noise, but around the in 
\par ventors of new values, doth the world revolve; tnaudibly it 
\par revolveth. 
\par 
\par And just own to it! Little had ever taken place when thy 
\par noise and smoke passed away. What, if a city did become a 
\par mummy, and a statue lay in the mud! 
\par 
\par And this do I say also to the o erthrowers of statues: It is 
\par certainly the greatest folly to throw salt into the sea, and statues 
\par into the mud. 
\par 
\par In the mud of your contempt lay the statue: but it is just its 
\par law, that out of contempt, its life and living beauty grow again! 
\par 
\par With diviner features doth it now arise, seducing by its 
\par suffering; and verily! it will yet thank you for o erthrowing it, 
\par ye subverters! 
\par 
\par This counsel, however, do I counsel to kings and churches, 
\par and to all that is weak with age or virtue let yourselves be 
\par o erthrown! That ye may again come to life, and that virtue 
\par may come to you! 
\par 
\par Thus spake I before the fire-dog: then did he interrupt me 
\par sullenly, and asked: "Church? What is that?" 
\par 
\par "Church?" answered I, "that is a kind of state, and indeed 
\par the most mendacious. But remain quiet, thou dissembling dog! 
\par Thou surely knowest thine own species best! 
\par 
\par Like thyself the state is a dissembling dog; like rnee doth 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par GREAT EVENTS 145 
\par 
\par it like to speak with smoke and roaring to make believe, like 
\par thee, that it speaketh out of the heart of things. 
\par 
\par For it seeketh by all means to be the most important crea 
\par ture on earth, the state; and people think it so." 
\par 
\par When I had said this, the fire-dog acted as if mad with envy. 
\par "What!" cried he, "the most important creature on earth? And 
\par people think it so?" And so much vapour and terrible voices 
\par came out of his throat, that I thought he would choke with 
\par vexation and envy. 
\par 
\par At last he became calmer and his panting subsided; as soon, 
\par however, as he was quiet, I said laughingly: 
\par 
\par "Thou art angry, fire-dog: so I am in the right about thee: 
\par 
\par And that I may also maintain the right, hear the story of 
\par another fire-dog; he speaketh actually out of theheart of the 
\par earth. 
\par 
\par Gold doth his breath exhale, and golden rain: so doth his 
\par heart desire. What are ashes and smoke ind hot dregs to him! 
\par 
\par Laughter flitteth from him like a variegated cloud; adverse is 
\par he to thy gargling and spewing and grips in the bowels! 
\par 
\par The gold, however, and the laughter these doth he take 
\par out of the heart of the earth: for, that thou mayst know it, 
\par the heart of the earth is of gold." 
\par 
\par When the fire-dog heard this, he could no longer endure to 
\par listen to me. Abashed did he draw in his tail, said "bow-wow!" 
\par in a cowed voice, and crept down into his cave. 
\par 
\par Thus told Zarathustra. His disciples, however, hardly 
\par listened to him: so great was their eagerness to tell him about 
\par the sailors, the rabbits, and the flying man. 
\par 
\par "What am I to think of it!" said Zarathustra. "Am I indeed 
\par a ghost? 
\par 
\par But it may have been my shadow. Ye have surely heard some 
\par thing of the Wanderer and his Shadow? 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 1-46 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par One thing, however, is certain: I must keep a tighter hold 
\par of it; otherwise it will spoil my reputation." 
\par 
\par And once more Zarathustra shook his head and wondered. 
\par "What am I to think of it!" said he once more. 
\par 
\par "Why did the ghost cry: It is time! It is the highest time! 
\par 
\par For what is it then- the highest time?" 
\par 
\par Ihus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 41. The Soothsayer 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AND I saw a great sadness come over mankind. The best 
\par turned weary of their works. 
\par 
\par A doctrine appeared, a faith ran beside it: All is empty, all 
\par is alike, all hath been! 
\par 
\par And from all hills there re-echoed: All is empty, all is 
\par alike, all hath been! 
\par 
\par To be sure we have harvested : but why have all our fruits 
\par become rotten and brown? What was it fell last night from 
\par the evil moon? 
\par 
\par In vain was all our labour, poison hath our wine become, the 
\par evil eye hath singed yellow our fields and hearts. 
\par 
\par Arid have we all become; and fire falling upon us, then do 
\par we turn dust like ashes: yea, the fire itself have we made 
\par aweary. 
\par 
\par All our fountains have dried up, even the sea hath receded. 
\par All the ground trieth to gape, but the depth will not swallow! 
\par 
\par Alas! where is there still a sea in which one could be 
\par drowned? so soundetb our plaint across shallow swamps. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE SOOTHSAYER 147 
\par 
\par Verily, even for dying have we become too weary; now do 
\par we keep awake and live on in sepulchres." 
\par 
\par Thus did Zarathustra hear a soothsayer speak; and the ^ore- 
\par boding touched his heart and transformed him. Sorrowfully 
\par did he go about and wearily; and he became like unto those of 
\par whom the soothsayer had spoken. 
\par 
\par Verily, said he unto his disciples, a little while, and there 
\par cometh the long twilight. Alas, how shall I preserve my light 
\par through it! 
\par 
\par That it may not smother in this sorrowfulness! To remoter 
\par worlds shall it be a light, and also to remotest nights! 
\par 
\par Thus did Zarathustra go about grieved in his heart, and for 
\par three days he did not take any meat or drink: he had no rest, 
\par and lost his speech. At last it came to pass that he fell into a 
\par deep sleep. His disciples, however, sat around him in long 
\par night-watches, and waited anxiously to see if he would awake, 
\par and speak again, and recover from his affliction. 
\par 
\par And this is the discourse that Zarathustra spake when he 
\par awoke; his voice, however, came unto his disciples as from 
\par afar: 
\par 
\par Hear, I pray you, the dream that I dreamed, my friends, and 
\par help me to divine its meaning! 
\par 
\par A riddle is it still unto me, this dream; the meaning is hidden 
\par in it and encaged, and doth not yet fly above it on free pinions. 
\par 
\par All life had I renounced, so I dreamed. Night-watchman 
\par and grave-guardian had I become, aloft, in the lone mountain- 
\par fortress of Death. 
\par 
\par There did I guard his coffins : full stood the musty vaults of 
\par those trophies of victory. Out of glass coffins did vanquished 
\par life gaze upon me. 
\par 
\par The odour of dust-covered eternities did I breathe: sultry 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 148 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par and dust-covered lay my soul. And who could have aired his 
\par soul there! 
\par 
\par Brightness of midnight was ever around me; lonesomeness 
\par cowered beside her; and as a third, death-rattle stillness, the 
\par worst of my female friends. 
\par 
\par Keys did I carry, the nastiest of all keys; and I knew how to 
\par open with them the most creaking of all gates. 
\par 
\par Like a bitterly angry croaking ran the sound through the 
\par long corridors when the leaves of the gate opened: ungra 
\par ciously did this bird cry, unwillingly was it awakened. 
\par 
\par But more frightful even, and more heart-strangling was it, 
\par when it again became silent and still all around, and I alone 
\par sat in that malignant silence. 
\par 
\par Thus did time pass with me, and slip by, if time there still 
\par was: what do I know thereof! But at last there happened that 
\par which awoke me. 
\par 
\par Thrice did there peal peals at the gate like thunders, thrice 
\par did the vaults resound and howl again: then did I go to the 
\par gate. 
\par 
\par Alpa! cried I, who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain? 
\par Alpa! Alpa! who carrieth his ashes unto the mountain? 
\par 
\par And I pressed the key, and pulled at the gate, and exerted 
\par myself. But not a finger s-breadth was it yet open : 
\par 
\par Then did a roaring wind tear the folds apart: whistling, 
\par whizzing, and piercing, it threw unto me a black coffin. 
\par 
\par And in the roaring and whistling and whizzing, the cofiin 
\par burst open, and spouted out a thousand peals of laughter. 
\par 
\par And a thousand caricatures of children, angels, owls, fools, 
\par and child-sized butterflies laughed and mocked, and roared at 
\par me 
\par 
\par Fearfully was I terrified thereby: it prostrated me. And I 
\par cried with horror as I ne er cried before. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE SOOTHSAYER 149 
\par 
\par But mine own crying awoke me: and I came to myself. 
\par 
\par Thus did Zarathustra relate his dream, and then was silent , 
\par for as yet he knew not the interpretation thereof. But the dis 
\par ciple whom he loved most arose quickly, seized Zarathustra s 
\par hand, and said : 
\par 
\par "Thy life itself interpreted! unto us this dream, G Zara 
\par thustra! 
\par 
\par Art thou not thyself the wind with shrill whistling, which 
\par bursteth open the gates of the fortress of Death? 
\par 
\par Art thou not thyself the coffin full of many-hued malices and 
\par angel-caricatures of life? 
\par 
\par Verily, like a thousand peals of children s laughter cometh 
\par Zarathustra into all sepulchres, laughing at those night-watch 
\par men and grave-guardians, and whoever else rattleth with sinis 
\par ter keys. 
\par 
\par With thy laughter wilt thou frighten and prostrate them: 
\par fainting and recovering wilt thou demonstrate thy power over 
\par them. 
\par 
\par And when the long twilight cometh and the mortal weari 
\par ness, even then wilt thou not disappear from our firmament, 
\par thou advocate of life! 
\par 
\par New stars hast thou made us see, and new nocturnal glories : 
\par verily, laughter itself hast thou spread out over us like a many- 
\par hued canopy. 
\par 
\par Now will children s laughter ever from coffins flow; now 
\par will a strong wind ever come victoriously unto all mortal weari 
\par ness: of this thou art thyself the pledge and the prophet! 
\par 
\par Verily, they themselves didst thou dream, thine enemies: 
\par that was thy sorest dream. 
\par 
\par But as thou awokest from them and earnest to thyself, so 
\par shall they awaken from themselves and come unto thee!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake the disciple; and all the others then thronged 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 150 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par around Zarathustra, grasped him by the hands, and tried to 
\par persuade him to leave his bed and his sadness, and return unto 
\par them. Zarathustra, however, sat upright on his couch, with an 
\par absent look. Like one returning from long foreign sojourn did 
\par he look on his disciples, and examined their features; but still 
\par he knew them not. When, however, they raised him, and set 
\par him upon his feet, behold, all on a sudden his eye changed; he 
\par understood everything that had happened, stroked his beard, 
\par and said with a strong voice: 
\par 
\par "Well! this hath just its time; but see to it, my disciples, 
\par that we have a good repast, and without delay! Thus do I mean 
\par to make amends for bad dreams! 
\par 
\par The soothsayer, however, shall eat and drink at my side: 
\par and verily, I will yet show him a sea in which ntr can drown 
\par himself!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. Then did he gaze long into the 
\par face of the disciple who had been the dream-interpreter, and 
\par shook his head. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par . Redemption 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHEN Zarathustra went one day over the great bridge, then 
\par did the cripples and beggars surround him, and a hunchback 
\par spake thus unto him: 
\par 
\par "Behold, Zarathustra! Even the people learn from thee, and 
\par acquire faith in thy teaching: but for them to believe fully in 
\par thee, one thing is still needful thou must first of all convince 
\par us cripples! Here hast thou now a fine selection, and verily, an 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par REDEMPTION 
\par 
\par opportunity with more than one forelock! The blind canst thou 
\par heal, and make the lame run; and from him who hath too 
\par much behind, couldst thou well, also, take away a little; 
\par that, I think, would be the right method to make the cripples 
\par believe in Zarathustra!" 
\par 
\par Zarathustra, however, answered thus unto him who so 
\par spake : When one taketh his hump from the hunchback, then 
\par doth one take from him his spirit so do the people teach. 
\par And when one giveth the blind man eyes, then doth he see too 
\par many bad things on the earth: so that he curseth him who 
\par healed him. He, however, who maketh the lame man run, in- 
\par flicteth upon him the greatest injury; for haidly can he run, 
\par when his vices run away with him so do the people teach 
\par concerning cripples. And why should not Zarathustra also 
\par learn from the people, when the people learn from Zara 
\par thustra? 
\par 
\par It is, however, the smallest thing unto me since I have been 
\par amongst men, to see one person lacking an eye, another an 
\par ear, and a third a leg, and that others have lost the tongue, or 
\par the nose, or the head. 
\par 
\par I see and have seen worse things, and divers things so 
\par hideous, that I should neither like to speak of all mattei$s, nor 
\par even keep silent about some of them: namely, men who lack 
\par everything, except that they have too much of one thing men 
\par who are nothing more than a big eye, or a big mouth, or a big 
\par belly, or something else big, reversed cripples, I call such 
\par men. 
\par 
\par And when I came out of my solitude, and for the first time 
\par passed over this bridge, then I could not trust mine eyes, but 
\par looked again and again, and said at last: "That is an ear! An 
\par ear as big as a man!" I looked still more attentively and ac- 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 152 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par tually there did move under the ear something that was pitiably 
\par small and poor and slim. And in truth this immense ear was 
\par perched on a small thin stalk the stalk, however, was a man! 
\par A person putting a glass to his eyes, could even recognise fur 
\par ther a small envious countenance, and also that a bloated 
\par soullet dangled at the stalk. The people told me, however, that 
\par the big ear was not only a man, but a great man, a genius. But 
\par I never believed in the people when they spake of great men 
\par and I hold to my belief that it was a reversed cripple, who 
\par had too little of everything, and too much of one thing. 
\par 
\par When Zarathustra had spoken thus unto the hunchback, and 
\par unto those of whom the hunchback was the mouthpiece and 
\par advocate, then did he turn to his disciples in profound dejec 
\par tion, and said: 
\par 
\par Verily, my friends, I walk amongst men as amongst the 
\par fragments and limbs of human beings! 
\par 
\par This is the terrible thing to mine eye, that I find man 
\par broken up, and scattered about, as on a battle- and butcher- 
\par ground. 
\par 
\par And when mine eye fleeth from the present to the bygone, it 
\par nndeth ever the same: fragments and limbs and fearful chances 
\par but no men! 
\par 
\par The present and the bygone upon earth ah! my friends 
\par that is my most unbearable trouble; and I should not know how 
\par to live, if I were not a seer of .vhat is to come. 
\par 
\par A seer, a purposer, a creator, a future itself, and a bridge to 
\par the future and alas! also as it were a cripple on th s bridge: 
\par all that is Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par And ye also asked yourselves often: "Who is Zarathustra 
\par to us? What shall he be called by us?" And like me, did re 
\par give yourselves questions for answers. 
\par 
\par Is he a promiser? Or a fulfiller? A conqueror? Or an in- 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par REDEMPTION 153 
\par 
\par heritor? A harvest? Or a ploughshare? A physician? Or a 
\par healed one? 
\par 
\par Is he a poet? Or a genuine one? An emancipator? Or a sub 
\par jugator? A good one? Or an evil one? 
\par 
\par I walk amongst men as the fragments of the future: that 
\par future which I contemplate. 
\par 
\par And it is all my poetisation and aspiration to compose and 
\par collect into unity what is fragment and riddle and fearful 
\par chance. 
\par 
\par And ho\\v could I endure to be a man, if man were not also 
\par the composer, and riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance! 
\par 
\par To redeem what is past, and to transform every "It was" 
\par into "Thus would I have it!" that only do I call redemption! 
\par 
\par Will so is the emancipator and joy-bringer called: thus 
\par have I taught you, my friends! But now learn this likewise: 
\par the Will itself is still a prisoner. 
\par 
\par Willing emancipateth : but what is that called which still 
\par putteth the emancipator in chains? 
\par 
\par "It was": thus is the Will s teeth-gnashing and lonesomest 
\par tribulation called. Impotent towards what hath been done it 
\par is a malicious spectator of all that is past. 
\par 
\par Not backward can the Will will; that it cannot break time 
\par and time s desire that is the Will s lonesomest tribulation. 
\par 
\par Willing emancipateth: what doth Willing itself devise in 
\par order to get free from its tribulation and mock at its prison? 
\par 
\par Ah, a fool becometh every prisoner! Foolishly delivereth 
\par itself also the imprisoned Will. 
\par 
\par That time dotli not run backward that is its animosity: 
\par "That which was" : so is the stone which it cannot roll called. 
\par 
\par And thus doth it roll stones out of animosity and ill-humour, 
\par and taketh revenge on whatever doth not, like it, feel rage and 
\par ill-humour. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 154 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Thus did the Will, the emancipator, become a torturer; and 
\par on all that is capable of suffering it taketh revenge, because it 
\par cannot go backward. 
\par 
\par This, yea, this alone is revenge itself: the Will s antipathy to 
\par time, and its "It was." 
\par 
\par Verily, a great folly dwelleth in our Will; and it became a 
\par curse unto all humanity, that this folly acquired spirit! 
\par 
\par The spirit of revenge: my friends, that hath hitherto been 
\par man s best contemplation; and where there was suffering, it 
\par was claimed there was always penalty. 
\par 
\par "Penalty," so calleth itself revenge. With a lying word it 
\par f eigneth a good conscience. 
\par 
\par And because in the wilier himself there is suffering, because 
\par he cannot will backwards thus was Willing itself, and all 
\par life, claimed to be penalty! 
\par 
\par And then did cloud after cloud roll over the spirit, until at 
\par last madness preached: "Everything perisheth, therefore every 
\par thing deserveth to perish!" 
\par 
\par "And this itself is justice, the law of time that he must 
\par devour his children:" thus did madness preach. 
\par 
\par "Morally are things ordered according to justice and 
\par penalty. Oh, where is there deliverance from the flux of things 
\par and from the existence of penalty?" Thus did madness preach. 
\par 
\par "Can there be deliverance when there is eternal justice? 
\par Alas, unreliable is the stone, It was : eternal must also be all 
\par penalties!" Thus did madness preach. 
\par 
\par "No deed can be annihilated: how could it be undone by 
\par the penalty! This, this is what is eternal in the existence of 
\par penalty, that existence also must be eternally recurring deed 
\par and guilt! 
\par 
\par Unless the Will should at last deliver itself, and Willing 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par REDEMPTION 155 
\par 
\par become non- Willing :" but ye know, my brethren, this fabu 
\par lous song of madness! 
\par 
\par Away from those fabulous songs did I lead you when I 
\par taught you: "The Will is a creator." 
\par 
\par All "It was" is a fragment, a riddle, a fearful chance until 
\par the creating Will saith thereto: "But thus would I have it." 
\par 
\par Until the creating Will saith thereto: "But thus do I will it! 
\par Thus shall I will it!" 
\par 
\par But did it ever speak thus? And when doth this take place? 
\par Hath the Will been unharnessed from its own folly? 
\par 
\par Hath the Will become its own deliverer and joy-bringer? 
\par Hath it unlearned the spirit of revenge and all teeth-gnashing? 
\par 
\par And who hath taught it reconciliation with time, and some 
\par thing higher than all reconciliation? 
\par 
\par Something higher than all reconciliation must the Will will 
\par which is the Will to Power : but how doth that take place? 
\par Who hath taught it also to will backwards? 
\par 
\par But at this point in his discourse it chanced that Zara- 
\par thustra suddenly paused, and looked like a person in the great 
\par est alarm. With terror in his eyes did he gaze on his disciples; 
\par his glances pierced as with arrows their thoughts and arrear- 
\par thoughts. But after a brief space he again laughed, and said 
\par soothedly: 
\par 
\par "It is difficult to live amongst men, because silence is so 
\par difficult especially for a babbler. "- 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. The hunchback, however, had 
\par listened to the conversation and had covered his face during 
\par the time; but when he heard Zarathustra laugh, he looked up 
\par with curiosity, and said slowly: 
\par 
\par "But why doth Zarathustra speak otherwise unto us than 
\par unto his disciples?" 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 156 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Zarathustra answered: "What is there to be wondered at! 
\par With hunchbacks one may well speak in a hunchbacked way!" 
\par 
\par "Very good," said the hunchback; "and with pupils one may 
\par well tell tales out of school. 
\par 
\par But why doth Zarathustra speak otherwise unto his pupils 
\par than unto himself?" 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par . Manly Prudence 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par NOT the height, it is the declivity that is terrible! 
\par 
\par The declivity, where the gaze shooteth downwards, and the 
\par hand graspeth upwards. There doth the heart become giddy 
\par through its double will. 
\par 
\par Ah, friends, do ye divine also my heart s double will? 
\par 
\par This, this is my declivity and my danger, that my gaze 
\par shooteth towards the summit, and my hand would fain clutch 
\par and lean on the depth! 
\par 
\par To man clingeth my will; with chains do I bind myself to 
\par man, because I am pulled upwards to the Superman: for 
\par thither doth mine other will tend. 
\par 
\par And therefore do I live blindly among men, as if I knew 
\par them not: that my hand may not entirely lose belief in 
\par firmness. 
\par 
\par I know not you men: this gloom and consolation is often 
\par spread around me. 
\par 
\par I sit at the gateway for every rogue, and ask : Who wisheth 
\par to deceive me? 
\par 
\par This is my first manly prudence, that I allow myself to be 
\par deceived, so as not to be on my guard against deceivers. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par MANLY PRUDENCE 157 
\par 
\par Ah, if I were on my guard against man, how could man be 
\par an anchor to my ball! Too easily would I be pulled upwards and 
\par away! 
\par 
\par This providence is over my fate, that I have to be without 
\par foresight. 
\par 
\par And he who would not languish amongst men, must learn 
\par to drink out of all glasses; and he who would keep clean 
\par amongst men, must know how to wash himself even with dirty 
\par water. 
\par 
\par And thus spake 1 often to myself for consolation: "Courage! 
\par Cheer up! old heart! An unhappiness hath failed to befall thee: 
\par enjoy that as thy happiness!" 
\par 
\par This, however, is mine other manly prudence: I am more 
\par forbearing to the vain than to the proud. 
\par 
\par Is not wounded vanity the mother of all tragedies? Where, 
\par however, pride is wounded, there there groweth up something 
\par better than pride. 
\par 
\par That life may be fair to behold, its game mus f , be well 
\par played; for that purpose, however, it needeth good actors. 
\par 
\par Good actors have I found all the vain ones : they play, and 
\par wish people to be fond of beholding them all their spirit is in 
\par this wish. 
\par 
\par They represent themselves, they invent themselves; in their 
\par neighbourhood I like to look upon life it cureth of mel 
\par ancholy. 
\par 
\par Therefore am I forbearing to the vain, because they are the 
\par physicians of my melancholy, and keep me attached to man 
\par as to a drama. 
\par 
\par And further, who conceiveth the full depth of the modesty 
\par of the vain man! I am favourable to him, and sympathetic on 
\par account of his modesty. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 158 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par From you would he learn his belief in himself; he feedeth 
\par upon your glances, he eateth praise out of your hands. 
\par 
\par Your lies doth he even believe when you lie favourably 
\par about him: for in its depths sigheth his heart: "What am 7?" 
\par 
\par And if that be the true virtue which is unconscious of itself 
\par well, the vain man is unconscious of his modesty! 
\par 
\par This is, however, my third manly prudence: I am not put 
\par out of conceit with the wicked by your timorousness. 
\par 
\par I am happy to see the marvels the warm sun hatcheth: tigers 
\par and palms and rattlesnakes. 
\par 
\par Also amongst men there is a beautiful brood of the warm 
\par sun, and much that is marvellous in the wicked. 
\par 
\par In truth, as your wisest did not seem to me so very wise, so 
\par found I also human wickedness below the fame of it. 
\par 
\par And oft did I ask with a shake of the head: Why still rattle, 
\par ye rattlesnakes? 
\par 
\par Verily, there is still a future even for evil! And the warmest 
\par south is still undiscovered by man. 
\par 
\par How many things are now called the worst wickedness, 
\par which are only twelve feet broad and three months long! Some 
\par day, however, will greater dragons come into the world. 
\par 
\par For that the Superman may not lack his dragon, the super- 
\par dragon that is worthy of him, there must still much warm sun 
\par glow on moist virgin forests! 
\par 
\par Out of your wild cats must tigers have evolved, and out of 
\par your poison-toads, crocodiles: for the good hunter shall have a 
\par good hunt! 
\par 
\par And verily, ye good and just! In you there is much to be 
\par laughed at, and especially your fear of what hath hitherto been 
\par called "the devil!" 
\par 
\par So alien are ye in your souls to what is great, that to you the 
\par Superman would be frightful in his goodness! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE STILLEST HOUR 159 
\par 
\par And ye wise and knowing ones, ye would flee from the solar- 
\par glow of the wisdom in which the Superman joyfully batheth his 
\par nakedness! 
\par 
\par Ye highest men who have come within my ken! this is my 
\par doubt of you, and my secret laughter: I suspect ye would call 
\par my Superman a devil! 
\par 
\par Ah, I became tired of those highest and best ones: from 
\par their "height" did I long to be up, out, and away to the Super 
\par man! 
\par 
\par A horror came over me when I saw those best ones naked : 
\par then there grew for me the pinions to soar away into distant 
\par futures. 
\par 
\par Into more distant futures, into more southern souths than 
\par ever artist dreamed of: thither, where gods are ashamed of all 
\par clothes! 
\par 
\par But disguised do I want to see you, ye neighbours and 
\par fellowmen, and well-attired and vain and estimable, as "the 
\par good and just;" 
\par 
\par And disguised will I myself sit amongst you that I may 
\par mistake you and myself: for that is my last manly prudence. 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra.

\par 44. The Stillest Hour 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHAT hath happened unto me, my friends? Ye see me 
\par troubled, driven forth, unwillingly obedient, ready to go 
\par alas, to go away from you! 
\par 
\par Yea, once more must Zarathustra retire to his solitude: but

\par What hath happened unto me? Who ordereth this? Ah, 
\par mine angry mistress wisheth it so; she spake unto me. Have I 
\par ever named her name to you? 
\par 
\par Yesterday towards evening there spake unto me my stillest 
\par hour: that is the name of my terrible mistress. 
\par 
\par And thus did it happen for everything must I tell you, 
\par that your heart may not harden against the suddenly departing 
\par one! 
\par 
\par Do ye know the terror of him who falleth asleep? 
\par 
\par To the very toes he is terrified, because the ground giveth 
\par way under him, and the dream beginneth. 
\par 
\par This do I speak unto you in parable. Yesterday at the stillest

\par 
\par The hour-hand moved on, the timepiece of my life drew

\par 
\par Then was there spoken unto me without voice: "Thou

\par 
\par And I cried in terror at this whispering, and the blood left 
\par my face: but I was silent. 
\par 
\par Then was there once more spoken unto me without voice : 
\par "Thou knowest it, Zarathustra, but thou dost not speak it!" 
\par 
\par And at last I answered, like one defiant: "Yea, I know it, 
\par but I will not speak it!" 
\par 
\par Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "Thou 
\par wilt not, Zarathustra? Is this true? Conceal thyself not behind 
\par thy defiance!" 
\par 
\par And I wept and trembled like a child, and said: "Ah, I 
\par would indeed, but how can I do it! Exempt me only from this! 
\par It is beyond my power!" 
\par 
\par Then was /-here again spoken unto me without voice : What

\par matter about thyself, Zarathustra! Speak thy word, and suc 
\par cumb!" 
\par 
\par And I answered: "Ah, is it my word? Who am I? I await the 
\par worthier one; I am not worthy even to succumb by it." 
\par 
\par Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "What 
\par matter about thyself? Thou art not yet humble enough for me. 
\par Humility hath the hardest skin." 
\par 
\par And I answered: "What hath not the skin of my humility 
\par endured! At the foot of my height do I dwell: how high are 
\par my summits, no one hath yet told me. But well do I know my 
\par valleys." 
\par 
\par Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "O 
\par Zarathustra, he who hath to remove mountains removeth also 
\par valleys and plains." 
\par 
\par And I answered: "As yet hath my word not removed moun 
\par tains, and what I have spoken hath not reached man. I went, 
\par indeed, unto men, but not yet have I attained unto them." 
\par 
\par Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "What 
\par knowest thou thereof! The dew f alleth on the grass when the 
\par night is most silent."- 
\par 
\par And I answered: "They mocked me when I found and 
\par walked in mine own path; and certainly did my feet then 
\par tremble. 
\par 
\par And thus did they speak unto me: Thou forgottest the path 
\par before, now dost thou also forget how to walk!" 
\par 
\par Then was there again spoken unto me without voice : "What 
\par matter about their mockery! Thou art one who hast unlearned 
\par to obey: now shalt thou command! 
\par 
\par Knowest thou not who is most needed by all? He who com- 
\par mandeth great things.

\par This is thy most unpardonable obstinacy: thou hast the 
\par power, and thou wilt not rule." 
\par 
\par And I answered: "I lack the lion s voice for all command 
\par ing." 
\par 
\par Then was there again spoken unto me as a whispering: "It 
\par is the stillest words which bring the storm. Thoughts that come 
\par with doves footsteps guide the world. 
\par 
\par O Zarathustra, thou shalt go as a shadow of that which is to 
\par come: thus wilt thou command, and in commanding go fore 
\par most." 
\par 
\par And I answered: "I am ashamed." 
\par 
\par Then was there again spoken unto me without voice: "Thou 
\par must yet become a child, and be without shame. 
\par 
\par The pride of youth is still upon thee; late hast thou become

\par 
\par And I considered a long while, and trembled. At last, how 
\par ever, did I say what I had said at first. "I will not." 
\par 
\par Then did a laughing take place all around me. Alas, how 
\par that laughing lacerated my bowels and cut into my heart! 
\par 
\par And there was spoken unto me for the last time: "O Zara 
\par thustra, thy fruits are ripe, but thou art not ripe for thy fruits! 
\par 
\par So must thou go again into solitude: for thou shalt yet be 
\par come mellow." 
\par 
\par And again was there a laughing, and it fled : then did it be 
\par come still around me, as with a double stillness. I lay, however, 
\par on the ground, and the sweat flowed from my limbs. 
\par 
\par Now have ye heard all, and why I have to return into my 
\par solitude. Nothing have I kept hidden from you, my friends. 
\par 
\par But even this have ye heard from me, who is still the most

\par I not give it? Am I then a niggard? 
\par 
\par When, however, Zarathustra had spoken these words, the 
\par violence of his pain, and a sense of the nearness of his de 
\par parture from his friends came over him, so that he wept aloud; 
\par and no one knew how to console him. In the night, however,

\par 
\par 
\par THEN, when k was about midnight, Zarathustra went his way 
\par over the ridge of the isle, that he might arrive early in the 
\par morning at the other coast; because there he meant to embark. 
\par For there was a good roadstead there, in which foreign ships 
\par also liked to anchor: those ships took many people with them, 
\par who wished to cross over from the Happy Isles. So when Zara 
\par thustra thus ascended the mountain, he thought on the way of 
\par his many solitary wanderings from youth onwards, and how 
\par many mountains and ridges and summits he had already 
\par climbed. , 
\par 
\par I am a wanderer and mountain climber, said he to his heart. 
\par I love not the plains, and it seemeth I cannot long sit still. 
\par 
\par And whatever may still overtake me as fate and experience 
\par a wandering will be therein, and a mountain-climbing: in 
\par the end one experienceth only oneself. 
\par 
\par The time is now past when accidents could befall me: and 
\par what could now fall to my lot which would not already be 
\par mine own! 
\par 
\par It returneth only, it cometh home to me at last mine own 
\par Self, and such of it as hath been long abroad, and scattered 
\par among things and accidents. 
\par 
\par And one thing more do I know : I stand now before my last 
\par summit, and before that which hath been longest reserved for 
\par me. Ah, my hardest path must I ascend! Ah, I have begun my 
\par lonesomest wandering!

\par 
\par He, however, who is of my nature doth not avoid such an 
\par hour: the hour that saith unto him: Now only dost thou go 
\par the way to thy greatness! Summit and abyss these are now 
\par comprised together! 
\par 
\par Thou goest the way to thy greatness : now hath it become thy 
\par last refuge, what was hitherto thy last danger! 
\par 
\par Thou goest the way to thy greatness : it must now be thy best 
\par courage that there is no longer any path behind thee! 
\par 
\par Thou goest the way to thy greatness : here shall no one steal 
\par after thee! Thy foot itself hath effaced the path behind thee, 
\par and over it standeth written: Impossibility. 
\par 
\par And if all ladders henceforth fail thee, then must thou learn 
\par to mount upon thine own head : how couldst thou mount up 
\par ward otherwise? 
\par 
\par Upon thine own head, and beyond thine own heart! Now 
\par must the gentlest in thee become the hardest. 
\par 
\par He who hath always much-indulged himself, skkeneth at 
\par last by his much-indulgence. Praises on what maketh hardy! I 
\par do not praise the land where butter and honey flow! 
\par 
\par To learn to look away from oneself, is necessary in order to 
\par see many things: this hardiness is needed by every mountain- 
\par climber. 
\par 
\par He, however, who is obtrusive with his eyes as a discerner, 
\par how can he ever see more of anything than its foreground! 
\par 
\par But thou, O Zarathustra, wouldst view the ground of every 
\par thing, and its background : thus must thou mount even above 
\par thyself up, upwards, until thou hast even thy stars under 
\par thee! 
\par 
\par Yea! To look down upon myself, and even upon my stars: 
\par that only would I call my summit, that hath remained for me 
\par as my last summit! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE WANDERER la 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra to himself while ascending, com 
\par forting his heart with harsh maxims : for he was sore at heart as 
\par he had never been before. And when he had reached the top 
\par of the mountain-ridge, behold, there lay the other sea spread 
\par out before him; and he stood still and was long silent. The 
\par night, however, was cold at this height, and clear and starry. 
\par 
\par I recognise my destiny, said he at last, sadly. Well! I am 
\par ready. Now hath my last lonesomeness begun. 
\par 
\par Ah, this sombre, sad sea, below me! Ah, this sombre noc 
\par turnal vexation! Ah, fate and sea! To you must I now go down! 
\par 
\par Before my highest mountain do I stand, and before my 
\par longest wandering: therefore must I first go deeper down than 
\par I ever ascended : 
\par 
\par Deeper down into pain than I ever ascended, even into its 
\par darkest flood! So willeth my fate. Well! I am ready. 
\par 
\par Whence come the highest mountains? so did I once ask. 
\par Then did I learn that they come out of the sea. 
\par 
\par That testimony is inscribed on their stones, and on the walls 
\par of their summits. Out of the deepest must the highest come 
\par to its height. 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra on the ridge of the mountain wnete 
\par it was cold: when, however, he came into the vicinity of the 
\par sea, and at last stood alone amongst the cliffs, then had he De- 
\par come weary on his way, and eagerer than ever before. 
\par 
\par Everything as yet s/eepeth, said he; even the sea sleepeth. 
\par Drowsily and strangely doth its eye gaze upon me. 
\par 
\par But it breatheth warmly I feel it. And I feel also that it 
\par dreameth. It tosseth about dreamily on hard pillows. 
\par

\par 
\par Ah, that my hand hath not strength enough! Gladly, indeed, 
\par would I free thee from evil dreams! 
\par 
\par And while Zarathustra thus spake, he laughed at himself 
\par with melancholy and bitterness. What! Zarathustra, said he, 
\par wilt thou even sing consolation to the sea? 
\par 
\par Ah, thou amiable fool, Zarathustra, thou too-blindly con 
\par fiding one! But thus hast thou ever been: ever hast thou ap 
\par proached confidently all that is terrible. 
\par 
\par Every monster wouldst thou caress. A whiff of warm breath,

\par to love and lure it.

\par Love is the danger of the lonesomest one, love to anything,

\par Then, however, he thought of his abandoned friends and as

\par THE VISION AND THE ENIGMA 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 46. The Vision and the Enigma 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHEN it got abroad among the sailors that Zarathustra was 
\par on board the ship for a man who came from the Happy Isles 
\par had gone on board along with him, there was great curiosity 
\par and expectation. But Zarathustra kept silent for two days, and 
\par was cold and deaf with sadness; so that he neither answered 
\par looks nor questions. On the evening of the second day, how 
\par ever, he again opened his ears, though he still kept silent: for 
\par there were many curious and dangerous things to be heard on 
\par board the ship, which came from afar, and was to go still fur 
\par ther. Zarathustra, however, was fond of all those who make 
\par distant voyages, and dislike to live without danger. And be 
\par hold! when listening, his own tongue was at last loosened, and 
\par the ice of his heart broke. Then did he begin to speak thus : 
\par 
\par To you, the daring venturers and adventurers, and whoever 
\par hath embarked with cunning sails upon frightful seas, 
\par 
\par To you the enigma-intoxicated, the twilight-enjoyers, whose 
\par souls are allured by flutes to every treacherous gulf: 
\par 
\par For ye dislike to grope at a thread with cowardly hand: 
\par and where ye can divine, there do ye hate to calculate 
\par 
\par To you only do I tell the enigma that I saw the vision of 
\par the lonesomest one. 
\par 
\par Gloomily walked I lately in corpse-coloured twilight 
\par gloomily and sternly, with Compressed lips. Not only one sun 
\par had set for me. 
\par 
\par A path which ascended daringly among boulders, an evil, 
\par lonesome path, ^hich neither herb nor shrub any longer 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 172 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par cheered, a mountain-path, crunched under the daring of my 
\par foot. 
\par 
\par Mutely marching over the scornful clinking of pebbles, 
\par trampling the stone that let it slip : thus did my foot force its 
\par way upwards. 
\par 
\par Upwards: in spite of the spirit that drew it downwards, 
\par towards the abyss, the spirit of gravity, my devil and arch 
\par enemy. 
\par 
\par Upwards: although it sat upon me, half-dwarf, half -mole; 
\par paralysed, paralysing; dripping lead in mine ear, and thoughts 
\par like drops of lead into my brain. 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra," it whispered scornfully, syllable by 
\par syllable, "thou stone of wisdom! Thou threwest thyself high, 
\par but every thrown stone must fall! 
\par 
\par Zarathustra, thou stone of wisdom, thou sling-stone, thou 
\par star-destroyer! Thyself threwest thou so high, but every 
\par thrown stone must fall! 
\par 
\par Condemned of thyself, and to thine own stoning: O Zara 
\par thustra, far indeed threwest thou thy stone but upon thyself 
\par will it recoil!" 
\par 
\par Then was the dwarf silent; and it lasted long. The silence, 
\par however, oppressed me; and to be thus in pairs, one is verily 
\par lonesomer than when alone! 
\par 
\par 1 ascended, I ascended, I dreamt, I thought, but everything 
\par oppressed me. A sick one did I resemble, whom bad torture 
\par wearieth, and a worse dream reawakeneth out of his first 
\par sleep. 
\par 
\par But there is something in me which I call courage: it hath 
\par hitherto slain for me every dejection. This courage at last 
\par bade me stand still and say: "Dwarf! Thou! Or I!" 
\par 
\par For courage is the best slayer, courage which attacketh: 
\par for in every attack there is sound of triumph. 
\par 
\par

\par Man, however, is the most courageous animal : thereby hath

\par overcome every pain; human pain, however, is the sorest pain.

\par Courage slayeth also giddiness at abysses: and where doth 
\par man not stand at abysses! Is not seeing itself seeing abysses? 
\par 
\par Courage is the best slayer: courage slayeth also fellow-suffer

\par 
\par Courage, however, is the best slayer, courage which at-

\par In such speech, however, there is much sound of triumph. 
\par He who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

\par 
\par Then happened that which made me lighter: for the dwarf 
\par sprang from my shoulder, the prying sprite! And it squatted 
\par on a stone in front of me. There was however a gateway just 
\par where we haked. 
\par 
\par "Look at this gateway! Dwarf!" I continued, "it hath two 
\par faces. Two roads come together here: these hath no one yet 
\par gone to the end of. 
\par 
\par This long lane backwards: it continueth for an eternity. And 
\par that long lane forward that is another eternity. 
\par 
\par They are antithetical to one another, these roads; they 
\par directly abut on one another: and it is here, at this gateway 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 174 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par that they come together. The name of the gateway is inscribed 
\par above: "This Moment. 
\par 
\par But should one follow them further and ever further and 
\par further on, thinkest thou, dwarf, that these roads would be 
\par eternally antithetical?" 
\par 
\par "Everything straight lieth," murmured the dwarf, con 
\par temptuously. "All truth is crooked; time itself is a circle." 
\par 
\par "Thou spirit of gravity!" said I wrathfully, "do not take it 
\par too lightly! Or I shall let thee squat where thou squattest, 
\par Haltfoot, and I carried thee htghV 
\par 
\par "Observe," continued I, "This Moment! From the gate 
\par way, This Moment, there runneth a long eternal lane back 
\par wards: behind us lieth an eternity. 
\par 
\par Must not whatever can run its course of all things, have 
\par already run along that lane? Must not whatever can happen of 
\par all things have already happened, resulted, and gone by? 
\par 
\par And if everything has already existed, what thinkest thou,

\par 
\par And are not all things closely bound together in such wise

\par

\par Yes! When I was a child, in my most distant childhood : 
\par

\par thieves and ghosts. And when I again heard such howling, then 
\par did it excite my commiseration once more. 
\par 
\par Where was now the dwarf? And the gateway? And the

\par 
\par But there lay a man! And there! The dog leaping, bristling, 
\par whining now did it see me coming then did it howl again,

\par And all my wandering and mountain-climbing: a necessity

\par 
\par And what have I hated more than passing clouds, and what 
\par ever tainteth thee? And mine own hatred have I even hated, 
\par because it tainted thee! 
\par 
\par The passing clouds I detest those stealthy cats of prey: 
\par they take from thee and me what is common to us the vast 
\par unbounded Yea- and Amen-saying. 
\par 
\par These mediators and mixers we detest the passing clouds: 
\par those half-and-half ones, that have neither learned to bless 
\par nor to curse from the heart. 
\par 
\par Rather will I sit in a tub under a closed heaven, rather will 
\par I sit in the abyss without heaven, than see thee, thou luminous

\par 
\par And ft he who cannot bless shall learn to curse!" this clear

\par 
\par This, however, is my blessing: to stand above everything

\par 
\par This wantonness and folly did I put in place of that Will,

\par 
\par . The Bedwarfing Virtue 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHEN Zarathustra was again on the continent, he did not go 
\par straightway to his mountains and his cave, but made many 
\par wanderings and questionings, and ascertained this and that; 
\par so that he said of himself jestingly: "Lo, a river that floweth 
\par back unco its source in many windings ! For he wanted to learn 
\par what had taken place among men during the interval : whether 
\par they had become greater or smaller. And once, when he saw a 
\par row of new houses, he marvelled, and said: 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE 185 
\par 
\par "What do these houses mean? Verily, no great soul put them 
\par up as its simile! 
\par 
\par Did perhaps a silly child take them out of its toy-box? 
\par Would that another child put them again into the box! 
\par 
\par And these rooms and chambers can men go out and in 
\par there? They seem to be made for silk dolls; or for dainty-eaters, 
\par who perhaps let others eat with them." 
\par 
\par And Zarathustra stood still and meditated. At last he said 
\par sorrowfully: "There hath everything become smaller! 
\par 
\par Everywhere do I see lower doorways : he who is of my type 
\par can still go therethrough, but he must stoop! 
\par 
\par Oh, when shall I arrive again at my home, where I shall no 
\par longer have to stoop shall no longer have to stoop before the 
\par small ones!" And Zarathustra sighed, and gazed into the 
\par distance. 
\par 
\par The same day, however, he gave his discourse on the be 
\par dwarfing virtue. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 2 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open: they 
\par do not forgive me for not envying their virtues. 
\par 
\par They bite at me, because I say unto them that for small 
\par people, small virtues are necessary and because it is hard for, 
\par me to understand that small people are necessary! 
\par 
\par Here am I still like a cock in a strange farm-yard, at which 
\par even the hens peck: but on that account I am not unfriendly 
\par to the hens. 
\par 
\par I am courteous towards them, as towards all small annoy 
\par ances; to be prickly towards what is small, seemeth to me 
\par wisdom for hedgehogs. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par l86 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par They all speak of me when they sit around their fire in the 
\par evening they speak of me, but no one thinketh--of me! 
\par 
\par This is the new stillness which I have experienced: their 
\par noise around me spreadeth a mantle over my thoughts. 
\par 
\par They shout to one another: "What is this gloomy cloud 
\par about to do to us? Let us see that it doth not bring a plague 
\par upon us!" 
\par 
\par And recently did a woman seize upon her child that was 
\par coming unto me: "Take the children away," cried she, "such 
\par eyes scorch children s souls." 
\par 
\par They cough when I speak: they think coughing an objec 
\par tion to strong winds they divine nothing of the boisterous- 
\par ness of my happiness! 
\par 
\par "We have not yet time for Zarathustra" so they object; but 
\par what matter about a time that "hath no time" for Zarathustra? 
\par 
\par And if they should altogether praise me, how could I go to 
\par sleep on their praise? A girdle of spines is their praise unto 
\par me: it scratcheth me even when I take it ofl. 
\par 
\par And this also did I learn among them: the praiser doeth as 
\par if he gave back; in truth, however, he wanteth more to be given 
\par him! 
\par 
\par Ask my foot if their lauding and luring strains please it! 
\par Veriiy, to such measure and ticktack, it liketh neither to dance 
\par nor to stand still. 
\par 
\par To small virtues would they fain lure and laud me; to the 
\par ticktack of small happiness would they fain persuade my foot. 
\par 
\par I pass through this people and keep mine eyes open; they 
\par have become smaller, and ever become smaller: the reason 
\par thereof is their doctrine of happiness and virtue. 
\par 
\par For they are moderate also in virtue, because they want 
\par comfort. With comfort, however, moderate virtue only is com 
\par patible 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE BEDWARFING VIRTUE 18; 
\par 
\par To be sure, they also learn in their way to stride on and stride 
\par forward: that, I call their hobbling. Thereby they become a

\par 
\par And many of them go forward, and look backwards thereby, 
\par with stiffened necks : those do I like to run up against. 
\par 
\par Foot and eye shall not lie, nor give the lie to each other. Bui 
\par there is much lying among small people. 
\par 
\par Some of them will, but most of them are willed. Some of

\par 
\par There are actors without knowing it amongst them, and

\par 
\par Of man there is little here: therefore do their women mascu 
\par linise themselves. For only he who is man enough, will save

\par 
\par And this hypocrisy found I worst amongst them, that even 
\par those who command feign the virtues of those who serve. 
\par 
\par "I serve, thou servest, we serve" so chanteth here even the 
\par hypocrisy of the rulers and alas! if the first lord be only the 
\par first servant! 
\par 
\par Ah, even upon their hypocrisy did mine eyes curiosity 
\par alight; and well did I divine all their fly-happiness, and their

\par 
\par So much kindness, so much weakness do I see. So much \\ as-

\par 
\par O Zarathustra, here is the great city: here hast thou nothing 
\par to seek and everything to lose. 
\par 
\par Why wouldst thou wade through this mire? Have pity upon 
\par /hy foot! Spit rather on the gate of the city, and turn back! 
\par 
\par Here is the hell for anchorites thoughts: here are great 
\par thoughts seethed alive and boiled small. 
\par 
\par Here do all great sentiments decay: here may only rattle- 
\par boned sensations rattle! 
\par 
\par Smellest thou not already the shambles and cookshops of 
\par the spirit? Steameth not this city with the fumes of slaughtered 
\par spirit? 
\par 
\par Seest thou not the souls hanging like limp dirty rags? And 
\par they make newspapers also out of these rags! 
\par 
\par Hearest thou not how spirit hath here become a verbal 
\par game? Loathsome verbal swill doth it vomit forth! And they 
\par make newspapers also out of this verbal swill. 
\par 
\par They hound one another, and know not whither! They in 
\par flame one another, and know not why! They tinkle with their 
\par pinchbeck, they jingle with their gold. 
\par 
\par They are cold, and seek warmth from distilled waters : they 
\par are inflamed, and seek coolness from frozen spirits; they are 
\par all sick and sore through public opinion. 
\par 
\par All lusts and vices are here at home; but here there are also 
\par the virtuous; there is much appointable appointed virtue: 
\par 
\par Much appointable virtue with scribe-fingers, and hardy 
\par sitting-flesh and waiting-flesh, blessed with small breast-stars,

\par and sighed, and was long silent. At last he spake thus: 
\par 
\par I loathe also this great city, and not only this fool. Here and 
\par there there is nothing to better, nothing to worsen. 
\par

\par to death once on a time!

\par That took place when the ungodliest utterance came from a 
\par God himself the utterance: "There is but one God! Thou 
\par shalt have no other gods before me!"

\par self in such wise:

\par

\par 
\par The ostrich runneth faster than the fastest horse, but it also 
\par thrusteth its head heavily into the heavy earth: thus is it with 
\par the man who cannot yet fly. 
\par 
\par Heavy unto him are earth and life, and so wtlleth the spirit 
\par of gravity! But he who would become light, and be a bird, 
\par must love himself : thus do / teach. 
\par 
\par Not, to be sure, with the love of the sick and infected, for 
\par with them stinketh even self-love! 
\par 
\par One must learn to love oneself thus do I teach with a 
\par wholesome and healthy love: that one may endure to be with 
\par oneself, and not go ro\\ing about. 
\par 
\par Such roving about christeneth itself "brotherly love"; with 
\par these words hath there hitherto been the best lying and dis 
\par sembling, and especially by those who have been burdensome 
\par to every one. 
\par 
\par And verily, it is no commandment for today and tomorrow 
\par to learn to love oneself. Rather is it of all arts the finest, 
\par subtlest, last and patientest. 
\par 
\par For to its possessor is all possession well concealed, and of all

\par 
\par Almost in the cradle are we apportioned with heavy words

\par 
\par And we we bear loyally what is apportioned unto us, on 
\par hard shoulders, over rugged mountains! And when we sweat, 
\par then do people say to us: Yea, life is hard to bear!" 
\par 
\par But man himself only is hard to bear! The reason thereof 
\par is that he carrieth too many extraneous things on his shoul 
\par ders. Like the camel kneeleth he down, and letteth himself be 
\par well laden. 
\par 
\par Especially the strong load-bearing man in whom reverence 
\par resideth. Too many extraneous heavy words and worths 
\par loadeth he upon himself then seemeth life to him a desert! 
\par 
\par And verily! Many a thing also that is our own is hard to 
\par bear! And many internal things in man are like the oyster 
\par repulsive and slippery and hard to grasp; 
\par 
\par So that an elegant shell, with elegant adornment, must plead 
\par for them. But this art also must one learn: to have a shell, and 
\par a fine appearance, and sagacious blindness! 
\par 
\par Again, it deceiveth about many things in man, that many a

\par 
\par And there will I not reside and abide where every one

\par 
\par Still more repugnant unto me, however, are all lick-spittles; 
\par and the most repugnant animal of man that I found, did I

\par 
\par This however is my teaching: he who wishtth one day to fly,

\par 
\par To flicker like small flames on high masts: a small light, 
\par certainly, but a great comfort to cast-away sailors and ship 
\par wrecked ones! 
\par 
\par By divers ways and wendings did I arrive at my truth; nof 
\par by one ladder did I mount to the height where mine eye roveth 
\par into my remoteness. 
\par 
\par And unwillingly only did I ask my way that was always 
\par counter to my taste! Rather did I question and test the ways 
\par themselves. 
\par 
\par A testing and a questioning hath been all my travelling: 
\par and verily, one must also learn to answer such questioning! 
\par That, however, is my taste: 
\par 
\par Neither a good nor a bad taste, but my taste, of which i 
\par have no longer either shame or secrecy.

\par As composer, riddle-reader, and redeemer of chance, did 
\par I teach them to create the future, and all that hath been to re

\par And whatever harm the world-maligners may do, the harm 
\par of the good is the harmfulest harm! 
\par 
\par O my brethren, into the hearts of the good and just looked 
\par some one once on a time, who said: "They are the Pharisees." 
\par BuLpeople did not understand him. 
\par 
\par \\The good and just themselves were not free to understand 
\par him; their spirit was imprisoned in their good conscience. The 
\par stupidity of the good is unfathomably wise, j 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par It is the truth, however, that the good must be Pharisees 
\par they have no choice! 
\par 
\par The good must crucify him who deviseth his own virtue! 
\par That is the truth! 
\par 
\par The second one, however, who discovered their country - 
\par the country, heart and soil of the good and just, it was he 
\par who asked: "Whom do they hate most?" 
\par 
\par The creator, hate they most, him who breaketh the tables 
\par and old values, the breaker, him they call the law-breaker. 
\par 
\par For the good they cannot create; they are always the be 
\par ginning of the end: 
\par 
\par They crucify him who writeth new values on new tables, 
\par they sacrifice unto themselves the future they crucify the 
\par whole human future! 
\par 
\par ITie good they have always been the beginning of the 
\par end. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par O my brethren, have ye also understood this word? And 
\par what I once said of the "last man"? 
\par 
\par With whom lieth the greatest danger to the whole human 
\par future? Is it not with the good and just? 
\par 
\par Break up, break up, I pray you, the good and just! O my 
\par brethren, have ye understood also this word? 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Ye flee from me? Ye are frightened? Ye tremble at this 
\par 
\par word? 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par OLD AND NEW TABLES 30 
\par 
\par O my brethren, when I enjoined you to break up the 
\par good, and the tables of the good, then only did I embark man 
\par on his high seas. 
\par 
\par And now only cometh unto him the great terror, the great 
\par outlook, the great sickness, the great nausea, the great sea 
\par sickness. 
\par 
\par False shores and false securities did the good teach you; in 
\par the lies of the good were ye born and bred. Everything hath 
\par been radically contorted and distorted by the good. 
\par 
\par But he who discovered the country of "man," discovered 
\par also the country of "man s future." Now shall ye be sailors 
\par for me, brave, patient! 
\par 
\par Keep yourselves up betimes, my brethren, learn to keep 
\par yourselves up! The sea stormeth: many seek to raise themselves 
\par again by you. 
\par 
\par The sea stormeth: all is in the sea. Well! Cheer up! Ye old 
\par seaman-hearts! 
\par 
\par What of fatherland! Thither striveth our helm where our 
\par children s land is! Thitherwards, stormier than the sea, 
\par stormeth our great longing!

\par 
\par "Why so hard!" said to the diamond one day the char 
\par coal; "are we then not near relatives?" 
\par 
\par Why so soft? O my brethren; thus do 7 ask you: are ye then 
\par not my brethren? 
\par 
\par Why so soft, so submissive and yielding? Why is there so 
\par much negation and abnegation in your hearts? Why is there 
\par so little fate in your looks? 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 240 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par And if ye will not be fates and inexorable ones, how can 
\par ye one day conquer with me? 
\par 
\par And if your hardness will not glance and cut and chip to 
\par pieces, how can ye one day create with me? 
\par 
\par For the creators are hard. And blessedness must it seem to 
\par you to press your hand upon millenniums as upon wax, 
\par 
\par Blessedness to write upon the will of millenniums as 
\par upon brass, harder than brass, nobler than brass. Entirely 
\par hard is only the noblest. 
\par 
\par This new table, O my brethren, put I up over you: Become 
\par hard! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 30 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par O thou, my Will! Thou change of every need, my needful 
\par ness! Preserve me from all small victories! 
\par 
\par Thou fatedness of my soul, which I call fate! Thou In-me! 
\par Over-me! Preserve and spare me for one great fate! 
\par 
\par And thy last greatness, my Will, spare it for thy last that 
\par thou mayest be inexorable in thy victory! Ah. who hath not 
\par succumbed to his victory ! 
\par 
\par Ah, whose eye hath not bedimmed in this intoxicated twi 
\par light! Ah, whose foot hath not faltered and forgotten in vic 
\par tory how to stand! 
\par 
\par That I may one day be ready and ripe in the great noon 
\par tide: ready and ripe like the glowing ore, the lightning-bearing 
\par cloud, and the swelling milk-udder: 
\par 
\par Ready for myself and for my most hidden Will: a bow 
\par eager for its arrow, an arrow eager for its star: 
\par 
\par A star, ready and ripe in its noontide, glowing, pierced, 
\par blessed by annihilating sun-arrows: 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE CONVALESCENT 241 
\par 
\par A sun itself, and an inexorable sun-will, ready for anni 
\par hilation in victory! 
\par 
\par O Will, thou change of every need, my needfulness! Spare 
\par me for one great victory! 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par . The Convalescent 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ONE morning, not long after his return to his cave, Zara^ 
\par thustra sprang up from his couch like a madman, crying with a 
\par frightful voice, and acting as if some one still lay on the couch 
\par who did not wish to rise. Zarathustra s voice also resounded 
\par in such a manner that his animals came to him frightened, and 
\par out of all the neighbouring caves and lurking-places all the 
\par creatures slipped away flying, fluttering, creeping or leaping, 
\par according to their variety of foot or wing. Zarathustra, how 
\par ever, spake these words : 
\par 
\par Up, abysmal thought out of my depth! I am thy cock and 
\par morning dawn, thou overslept reptile: Up! Up! My voice shall 
\par soon crow thee awake! 
\par 
\par Unbind the fetters of thine ears: listen! For I wish to hear 
\par thee! Up! Up! There is thunder enough to make the very graves 
\par listen! 
\par 
\par And rub the sleep and all the dimness and blindness out of 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 242 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par thine eyes! Hear me also with thine eyes: my voice is a medi 
\par cine even for those born blind. 
\par 
\par And once thou art awake, then shalt thou ever remain awake. 
\par It is not my custom to awake great-grandmothers out of their 
\par sleep that I may bid them sleep on! 
\par 
\par Thou stirrest, stretchiest thyself, wheezest? Up! Up! Not 
\par wheeze, shalt thou, but speak unto me! Zarathustra calieth 
\par thee, Zarathustra the godless! 
\par 
\par I, Zarathustra, the advocate of living, the advocate of suffer 
\par ing, the advocate of the circuit thee do I call, my most 
\par abysmal thought! 
\par 
\par Joy to me! Thou comest, I hear thee! Mine abyss speaketh, 
\par my lowest depth have I turned over into the light! 
\par 
\par Joy to me! Come hither! Give me thy hand ha! let be! 
\par aha! Disgust, disgust, disgust alas to me! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Hardly, however, had Zarathustra spoken these words, 
\par when he fell down as one dead, and remained long as one 
\par dead. When however he again came to himself, then was he 
\par pale and trembling, and remained lying; and for long he 
\par would neither eat nor drink. This condition continued for 
\par seven days; his animals, however, did not leave him day nor 
\par night, except that the eagle flew forth to fetch food. And what 
\par it fetched and foraged, it laid on Zarathustra s couch: so that 
\par Zarathustra at last lay among yellow and red berries, grapes, 
\par rosy apples, sweet-smelling herbage, and pine-cones. At his 
\par feet, however, two lambs were stretched, which the eagle had 
\par with difficulty carried off from their shepherds. 
\par 
\par At last, after seven days, Zarathustra raised himself upon his 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE CONVALESCENT 243 
\par 
\par couch, took a rosy apple in his hand, smelt it and found its 
\par smell pleasant. Then did his animals think the time had come 
\par to speak unto him. 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra," said they, "now hast thou lain thus for 
\par seven days with heavy eyes: wilt thou not set thyself again 
\par upon thy feet? 
\par 
\par Step out of thy cave: the world waiteth for thee as a garden. 
\par The wind playeth with heavy fragrance which seeketh for 
\par thee; and all brooks would like to run after thee. 
\par 
\par All things long for thee, since thou hast remained alone f o)- 
\par seven days step forth out of thy cave! All things want to be 
\par thy physicians! 
\par 
\par Did perhaps a new knowledge come to thee, a bitter, 
\par grievous knowledge? Like leavened dough layest thou, thy soul 
\par arose and swelled beyond all its bounds. " 
\par 
\par O mine animals, answered Zarathustra, talk on thus and 
\par let me listen! It refresheth me so to hear your talk: where there 
\par is talk, there is the world as a garden unto me. 
\par 
\par How charming it is that there are words and tones; are not 
\par words and tones rainbows and seeming bridges twixt the 
\par eternally separated? 
\par 
\par To each soul belongeth another world; to each soul is every 
\par other soul a back- world. 
\par 
\par Among the most alike doth semblance deceive most de 
\par lightfully: for the smallest gap is most difficult to bridge over. 
\par 
\par For me how could there be an outside-of-me? There is nc 
\par outside! But this we forget on hearing tones; how delightful 
\par it is that we forget! 
\par 
\par Have not names and tones been given unto things that mar 
\par may refresh himself with them? It is a beautiful folly, speak 
\par ing; therewith danceth man over everything. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 244 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par How lovely is all speech and all falsehoods oJ //*,&lt;&&. Witb 
\par lones danceth our love on variegated rainbows. - 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra," said then his animals, "to those who 
\par think like us, things all dance themselves : they come and hold 
\par out the hand and laugh and flee and return. 
\par 
\par Everything goeth, everything returneth; eternally rolleth the 
\par wheel of existence. Everything dieth, everything blossometh 
\par forth again; eternally runneth on the yetr of existence. 
\par 
\par Everything breaketh, everything is integrated anew; eter 
\par nally buildeth itself the same house of existence. All things 
\par separate, all things again greet one another; eternally true to 
\par itself remaineth the ring of existence. 
\par 
\par Every moment beginneth existence, around every Here 
\par rolleth the ball There. The middle is everywhere. Crooked 
\par is the path of eternity." 
\par 
\par O ye wags and barrel-organs! answered Zarathustra, and 
\par smiled once more, how well do ye know what had to be ful- 
\par fiJled in seven days: 
\par 
\par And how that monster crept into my throat and choked 
\par me! But I bit off its head and spat it away from me. 
\par 
\par And ye ye have made a lyre-lay out of it? Now, however, 
\par do I lie here, still exhausted with that biting and spitting- 
\par away, still sick with mine own salvation. 
\par 
\par And ye looked on at it all? O mine animals, are ye also cruel? 
\par Did ye like to look at my great pain as men do? For man is the 
\par cruellest animal. 
\par 
\par At tragedies, bull-fights, and crucifixions hath he hitherto 
\par been happiest on earth; and when he invented his hell, behold, 
\par that was his heaven on earth. 
\par 
\par When the great man crieth : immediately runneth the 
\par little man thither, and his tongue hangeth out of his mouth 
\par tor very lusting. He, however, calleth it his "pity." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE CONVALESCENT 245 
\par 
\par little man, especially the poet how passionately doth 
\par he accuse life an words! Hearken to him, but do not fail to hear 
\par the delight which is in all accusation! 
\par 
\par Such accusers of life them life overcometh with a glance of 
\par the eye. "Thou lovest me?" saith the insolent one; "wait a 
\par Uttie, as yet have I no time for thee." 
\par 
\par Towards himself man is the cruellest animal; and in all who 
\par call themselves "sinners" and "bearers of the cross" and 
\par "penitents," do not overlook the voluptuousness in their 
\par plaints and accusations! 
\par 
\par And I myself do. I thereby want to be man s accuser? Ah, 
\par mine animals, this only have I learned hitherto, that for rnan 
\par his baddest is necessary for his best, - 
\par 
\par That all that is baddest is the best power, and the hardest 
\par stone for the highest creator; and that man must become 
\par better and badder: 
\par 
\par Not to this torture-stake was I tied, that I know man is bad, 
\par but I cried, as no one hath yet cried: 
\par 
\par "Ah, tha : his baddest is so very small! Ah, that his best is so 
\par very small!" 
\par 
\par The great disgust at man it strangled me and had crept 
\par into my throat: and what the soothsayer had presaged: "All is 
\par alike, nothing is worth while, knowledge strangleth." 
\par 
\par A long twilight limped on before me, a fatally weary, 
\par fatally intoxicated sadness, which spake with yawning mouth. 
\par 
\par "Eternally he returneth, the man of whom thou art weary, 
\par the small man" so yawned my sadness, and dragged its foot 
\par and could not go to sleep. 
\par 
\par A cavern, became the human earth to me; its breast caved in; 
\par everything living became to me human dust and bones and 
\par mouldering past. 
\par 
\par My sighing sat on all human graves, and could no longer 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 1^6 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par mse: my sighing and questioning croaked and choked, 
\par gnawed and nagged day and night: 
\par 
\par "Ah, man returneth eternally! The small man returner* 
\par eternally!" 
\par 
\par Naked had I once seen both of them, the greatest man anc 
\par the smallest man: all too like one another all too human 
\par even the greatest man! 
\par 
\par All too small, even the greatest man! that was my disgus? 
\par it man! And the eternal return also of the smallest man! that 
\par was my disgust at all existence! 
\par 
\par Ah, Disgust! Disgust! Disgust! Thus spake Zarathus- 
\par 
\par tra, and sighed and shuddered; for he remembered his sick 
\par ness. Then did his animals prevent him from speaking further 
\par 
\par "Do not speak further, thou convalescent!" so answered 
\par his animals, "but go out where the world waiteth for thee like 
\par a garden. 
\par 
\par Go out unto the roses, the bees, and the flocks of doves! 
\par Especially, however, unto the singing-birds, to learn singing 
\par from them! 
\par 
\par For singing is for the convalescent; the sound ones may talk. 
\par And when the sound also want songs, then want they other 
\par c&gt;ongs than the convalescent." 
\par 
\par "O ye wags and barrel-organs, do be silent!" answered 
\par Zarathustra, and smiled at his animals. "How well ye know 
\par what consolation I devised for myself in seven days! 
\par 
\par That I have to sing once more that consolation did I de 
\par vise for myself, and this convalescence: would ye also make 
\par another lyre-lay thereof?" 
\par 
\par -"Do not talk further," answered his animals once more; 
\par "rather, thou convalescent, prepare for thyself first a lyre, a 
\par new lyre! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE CONVALESCENT 247 
\par 
\par For behold, O Zarathustra! For thy new lays there are 
\par needed new lyres. 
\par 
\par Sing and bubble over, O Zarathustra, heal thy soul with ne\\v 
\par ! ays : that thou mayest bear thy great fate, which hath not yet 
\par been any one s fate! 
\par 
\par For thine animals know it well, O Zarathustra, who thou 
\par art and must become: behold, thou art the teacher of the 
\par eternal return,- that is now thy fate! 
\par 
\par That thou must be the first to teach this teaching how 
\par could this great fate not be thy greatest danger and infirmity! 
\par 
\par Behold, we know what thou teachest: that all things eter 
\par nally return, and ourselves with them, and that we have already 
\par existed times without number, and all things with us. 
\par 
\par Thou teachest that there is a great year of Becoming, a 
\par prodigy of a great year; it must, like a sand-glass, ever turn up 
\par anew, that it may anew run down and run out: 
\par 
\par So that all those years are like one another in the greatest 
\par and also in the smallest, so that we ourselves, in every great 
\par year, are like ourselves in the greatest and also in the smallest. 
\par 
\par And if thou wouldst now die, O Zarathustra, behold, we 
\par know also how thou wouldst then speak to thyself: but thine 
\par animals beseech thee not to die yet! 
\par 
\par Thou wouldst speak, and without trembling, buoyant rather 
\par with bliss, for a great weight and worry would be taken from 
\par thee, thou patientest one! 
\par 
\par Now do I die and disappear, wouldst thou say, and in a 
\par moment I am nothing. Souls are as mortal as bodies. 
\par 
\par But the plexus of causes returneth in which I am inter 
\par twined, it will again create me! I myself pertain to the cause? 
\par ot the eternal return. 
\par 
\par I come again with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 248 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par with this serpent not to a new life, or a better life, or a similar 
\par life: 
\par 
\par ---I Tome again eternally to this identical and selfsame life, 
\par in its greatest and its smallest, to teach again the eternal return 
\par of dl things, 
\par 
\par To speak again the word of the great noontide of earth 
\par and man, to announce again to man the Superman. 
\par 
\par I have spoken my word. I break down by my word: so 
\par willeth mine eternal fate as announcer do I succumb! 
\par 
\par The hour hath now come for the down-goer to bless himself . 
\par Thus endeth Zarathustra s down-going. 
\par 
\par When the animals had spoken these words they were silent 
\par and waited, so that Zarathustra might say something to them ; 
\par but Zarathustra did not hear that they were silent. On the con 
\par trary, he lay quietly with closed eyes like a person sleeping, 
\par although he did not sleep; for he communed just then with his 
\par soul. The serpent, however, and the eagle, when they found 
\par him silent in such wise, respected the great stillness around 
\par him, and prudently retired. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par . The Great Longing 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par O MY soul, I have taught thee to say "today" as "once on a 
\par time" and "formerly," and to dance thy measure over every 
\par Here and There and Yonder. 
\par 
\par O my soul, I delivered thee from all by-places, I brushed 
\par down from thee dust and spiders and twilight. 
\par 
\par O my soul, I washed the petty shame and the by-place virtue 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE GREAT LONGING 249 
\par 
\par from thee, and persuaded thee to stand naked before the eyes 
\par uf the sun. 
\par 
\par With the storm that is called "spirit" did I blow over thy 
\par surging sea; all clouds did I blow away from it; I strangled even 
\par the strangler called "sin." 
\par 
\par O my soul, I gave thee the right to say Nay like the storm, 
\par and to say Yea as the open heaven saith Yea: calm as the light 
\par remainest thou, and now walkest through denying storms. 
\par 
\par O my soul, I restored to thee liberty over the created and the 
\par uncreated; and who knoweth. as thou knowest, the voluptuous 
\par ness of the future? 
\par 
\par O my soul, I taught thee the contempt which doth not come 
\par like worm-eating, the great, the loving contempt, which loveth 
\par most where it contemneth most. 
\par 
\par O my soul, I taught thee so to persuade that thou persuadest 
\par even the grounds themselves to thee : like the sun, which per- 
\par suadeth even the sea to its height. 
\par 
\par O my soul, I have taken from thee all obeying and knee* 
\par bending and homage-paying; I have myself given thee the 
\par names, "Change of need" and "Fate." 
\par 
\par O my soul, I have given thee new names and gay-coloured 
\par playthings, I have called thee "Fate" and "the Circuit of cir 
\par cuits" and "the Navel-string of time" and "the Azure bell." 
\par 
\par O my soul, to thy domain gave I all wisdom to drink all new 
\par wines, and also all immemorially old strong wines of wisdom. 
\par 
\par O my soul, every sun shed I upon thee, and every night and 
\par every silence and every longing: then grewest thou up for 
\par me as a vine. 
\par 
\par O my soul, exuberant and heavy dost thou now stand forth, 
\par a vine with swelling udders and full clusters of brown golden 
\par grapes: 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 2^0 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Filled and weighted by thy happiness, waiting from 
\par superabundance, and yet ashamed of thy waiting. 
\par 
\par O my soul, there is nowhere a soul which could be more 
\par loving and more comprehensive and more extensive! Where 
\par could future and past be closer together than with thee? 
\par 
\par O my soul, I have given thee everything, and all my hands 
\par have become empty by thee: and now! Now sayest thou to 
\par me, smiling and full of melancholy: "Which of us oweth 
\par thanks? 
\par 
\par Doth the giver not owe thanks because the receiver re 
\par ceived? Is bestowing not a necessity? Is receiving not pity 
\par ing?" 
\par 
\par O my soul, I understand the smiling of thy melancholy: 
\par thine over-abundance itself now stretcheth out longing hands! 
\par 
\par Thy fulness looketh forth over raging seas, and seeketh and 
\par waiteth: the longing of over-fulness looketh forth from the 
\par smiling heaven of thine eyes! 
\par 
\par And verily, O my suul! Who could see thy smiling and not 
\par melt into tears? The angels themselves melt into tears through 
\par the over-graciousness of thy smiling. 
\par 
\par Thy graciousness and over-graciousness, is it which will not 
\par complain and weep: and yet, O my soul, longeth thy smiling 
\par for tears, and thy trembling mouth for sobs. 
\par 
\par "Is not all weeping complaining? And all complaining, ac 
\par cusing?" Thus speakest thou to thyself; and therefore, O my 
\par soul, wilt thou rather smile than pour forth thy grief 
\par 
\par Than in gushing tears pour forth all thy grief concerning 
\par thy fulness, and concerning the craving of the vine for the 
\par vintager and vintage-knife! 
\par 
\par But wilt thou not weep, wilt thou not weep forth thy purple 
\par melancholy, then wilt thou have to sing, O my soul! Behold- 
\par T smile myself, who foretell thee this: 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE GREAT LONGING 251 
\par 
\par Thou wilt have to sing with passionate song, until all seas 
\par turn calm to hearken unto thy longing, 
\par 
\par Until over calm longing seas the bark giideth, the golden 
\par marvel, around the gold of which all good, bad, and marvel 
\par lous things frisk: 
\par 
\par Also many large and small animals, and everything that 
\par hath light marvellous feet, so that it can run on violet-blue 
\par paths, 
\par 
\par Towards the golden marvel, the spontaneous bark, and its 
\par master: he, however, is the vintager who waiteth with the 
\par diamond vintage-knife, 
\par 
\par Thy great deliverer, O my soul, the nameless one 
\par -for whom future songs only will find names! And verily, 
\par already hath thy breath the fragrance of future songs, 
\par 
\par Already glowest thou and dreamest, already drinkest thou 
\par thirstily at all deep echoing wells of consolation, already re- 
\par poseth thy melancholy in the bliss of future songs! 
\par 
\par O my soul, now have I given thee all, and even my last 
\par possession, and all my hands have become empty by thee: 
\par that I bade thee sing, behold, that was my last thing to give! 
\par 
\par That I bade thee sing, say now, say: which of us now 
\par oweth thanks? Better still, however: sing unto me, sing, O 
\par aiy soul! And let me thank thee!

\par "INTO thine eyes gazed I lately, O Life: gold saw I gleam in 
\par chy night-eyes, my heart stood still with delight: 
\par 
\par A golden bark saw I gleam on darkened waters, a sinking, 
\par drinking, reblinking, golden swing-bark! 
\par 
\par At my dance-frantic foot, dost thou cast a glance, a laughing, 
\par questioning, melting, thrown glance: 
\par 
\par Twice only movedst thou thy rattle with thy little hands 
\par then did my feet swing with dance-fury. 
\par 
\par My heels reared aloft, my toes they hearkened, thee they 
\par would know : hath not the dancer his ear in his toe! 
\par 
\par Unto thee did I spring: then fledst thou back from my 
\par bound; and towards me waved thy fleeing, flying tresses round! 
\par 
\par Away from thee did I spring, and from tiiy snaky tresses: 
\par then stoodst thou there half -turned, and in thine eye caresses. 
\par 
\par With crooked glances dost thou teach me crooked courses; 
\par on crooked courses learn my feet crafty fancies! 
\par 
\par I fear thee near, I love thee far; thy flight allureth me, thy 
\par seeking secureth me: I suffer, but for thee, what would I not 
\par gladly bear! 
\par 
\par For thee, whose coldness inflameth, whose hatred mislead- 
\par eth, whose flight enchaineth, whose mockery pleadeth : 
\par 
\par Who would not hate thee, thou great bindress, in-

\par art thou? Give me thy hand! Or thy finger only! 
\par 
\par Here are caves and thickets: we shall go astray! Halt! 
\par Stand still! Seest thou not owls and bats in fluttering fray? 
\par 
\par Thou bat! Thou owl! Thou wouldst play me foul? Where 
\par are we? From the dogs hast thou learned thus to bark and howl. 
\par 
\par Thou gnashest on me sweetly with little white teeth; thine 
\par evil eyes shoot out upon me, thy curly little mane from under 
\par neath! 
\par 
\par This is a dance over stock and stone: I am the hunter, wilt 
\par thou be my hound, or my chamois anon? 
\par 
\par Now beside me! And quickly, wickedly springing! Now up? 
\par And over! Alas! I have fallen myself overswinging! 
\par 
\par Oh, see me lying, thou arrogant one, and imploring grace; 
\par Gladly would I walk with thee in some lovelier place! 
\par 
\par In the paths of love, through bushes variegated, quiet, 
\par trim! Or there along the lake, where gold-fishes dance and 
\par swim! 
\par 
\par Thou art now a- weary? There above are sheep and sun-set 
\par stripes: is it not sweet to sleep the shepherd pipes? 
\par 
\par Thou art so very weary? I carry thee thither; let just thine 
\par arm sink! And art thou thirsty I should have something; but 
\par thy mouth would not like it to drink! 
\par 
\par Oh, that cursed, nimble, supple serpent and lurking-

\par thy hand, two spots and red blotches itch!

\par closed : 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra! Crack not so terribly with thy whip! Thou 
\par knowest surely that noise killeth thought, and just now 
\par there came to me such delicate thoughts. 
\par 
\par We are both of us genuine ne er-do-wells and ne er-do-ills.

\par 
\par If thy Wisdom should one day run away from thee, ah! then 
\par would also my love run away from thee quickly." 
\par 
\par Thereupon did Life look thoughtfully behind and around, 
\par and said softly: "O Zarathustra, thou art not faithful enough 
\par to me! 
\par 
\par Thou lovest me not nearly so much as thou sayest; I know

\par again passed moons and years over Zarathustra s soul, 
\par and he heeded it not; his hair, however, became white. One 
\par day when he sat on a stone in front of his cave, and gazed 
\par calmly into the distance one there gazeth out on the sea, and 
\par away beyond sinuous abysses, then went his animals thought 
\par fully round about him, and at last set themselves in front of 
\par him. 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra," said they, "gazest thou out perhaps for thy 
\par happiness?" "Of what account is my happiness!" answered 
\par he, "I have long ceased to strive any more for happiness, I 
\par strive for my work." "O Zarathustra," said the animals once 
\par more, "that sayest thou as one who hath overmuch of good 
\par things. Liest thou not in a sky-blue lake of happiness?"- -"Ye 
\par wags," answered Zarathustra, and smiled, "how well did ye 
\par choose the simile! But ye know also that my happiness is heavy, 
\par and not like a fluid wave of water : it presseth me and will not 
\par leave me, and is like molten pitch. "- 
\par 
\par Then went his animals again thoughtfully around him, and 
\par placed themselves once more in front of him. "O Zarathustra," 
\par said they, "it is consequently for that reason that thou thy 
\par self always becometh yellower and darker, although thy hair 
\par looketh white and flaxen? Lo, thou sittest in thy pitch! "- 
\par "What do ye say, mine animals?" said Zarathustra, laughing; 
\par "verily I reviled when I spake of pitch. As it happeneth with 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 264 THUS SPAKE ZARATHflSTRA 
\par 
\par me, so is it with all fruits that turn ripe. It is the honey in my 
\par veins that maketh my blood thicker, and also my soul .stiller." 
\par "So will it be, O Zarathustra," answered his animals, and 
\par pressed up to him; "but wilt thou not today ascend a high 
\par mountain? The air is pure, and today one seeth more of the 
\par world than ever."- -"Yea, mine animals," answered he, "ye

\par ascend a high mountain! But see that honey is then ready to 
\par hand, yellow, white, good, ice-cool, golden-comb-honey. For

\par 
\par When Zarathustra, however, was aloft on the summit, he 
\par sent his animals home that had accompanied him, and found 
\par that he was now alone: then he laughed from the bottom of 
\par his heart, looked around him, and spake thus: 
\par

\par if the world be as a gloomy forest of animals, and a pleasure- 
\par ground for all wild huntsmen, it seemeth to me rather and

\par his face had changed since then; and when Zarathustra looked 
\par into his eyes, his heart was startled once more: so much evil 
\par announcement and ashy-grey lightnings passed over that coun 
\par tenance. 
\par 
\par The soothsayer, who had perceived what went on in Zara- 
\par thustra s soul, wiped his face with his hand, as if he would 
\par wipe out the impression; the same did also Zarathustra. And 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 268 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par when both of them had thus silently composed and strength 
\par ened themselves, they gave each other the hand, as a token 
\par that they wanted once more to recognise each other. 
\par 
\par "Welcome hither," said Zarathustra, "thou soothsayer of 
\par the great weariness, not in vain shalt thou once have been my 
\par messmate and guest. Eat and drink also with me to-day, and 
\par forgive it that a cheerful old man sitteth with thee at table!" 
\par "A cheerful old man?" answered the soothsayer, shaking his 
\par head, "but whoever thou art, or wouldst be, O Zarathustra, 
\par thou hast been here aloft the longest time, in a little while 
\par thy bark shall no longer rest on dry land!"- -"Do 1 then rest 
\par on dry land?" asked Zarathustra, laughing. "The waves 
\par around thy mountain," answered the soothsayer, "rise and 
\par rise, the waves of great distress and affliction: they will soon 
\par raise thy bark also and carry thee away." Thereupon was 
\par Zarathustra silent and wondered. "Dost thou still hear 
\par nothing?" continued the soothsayer: "doth it not rush and 
\par roar out of the depth?" Zarathustra was silent once more and 
\par listened: then heard he a long, long cry, which the abysses 
\par threw to one another and passed on; for none of them wished 
\par to retain it: so evil did it sound. 
\par 
\par "Thou ill announcer," said Zarathustra at last, "that is a cry 
\par of distress, and the cry of a man; it may come perhaps out of 
\par a black sea. But what doth human distress matter to me! My last 
\par sin which hath been reserved for me, knowest thou what it is 
\par called?" 
\par 
\par Pity!" answered the soothsayer from an overflowing 
\par heart, and raised both his hands aloft "O Zarathustra, I have 
\par come that I may seduce thee to thy last sin!" 
\par 
\par And hardly had those words been uttered when there 
\par sounded the cry once more, and longer and more alarming 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE CRY OF DISTRESS 269 
\par 
\par than before also much nearer. "Hearest thou? Hearest thou, 
\par O Zarathustra?" called out the soothsayer, "the cry concerneth 
\par tnee, it calleth thee: Come, come, come; it is time, it is the 
\par highest time!" 
\par 
\par Zarathustra was silent thereupon, confused and staggered; 
\par at last he asked, like one who hesitateth in himself: "And who 
\par is it that there calleth me?" 
\par 
\par "But thou knowest it, certainly," answered the soothsayer 
\par warmly, "why dost thou conceal thyself? It is the higher man 
\par that crieth for thee!" 
\par 
\par "The higher man?" cried Zarathustra, horror-stricken: 
\par "what wanteth he? What wanteth he? The higher man! What 
\par wanteth he here?" and his skin covered with perspiration. 
\par 
\par The soothsayer, however, did not heed Zarathustra s alarm, 
\par but listened and listened in the downward direction. When, 
\par however, it had been still there for a long while, he looked 
\par behind, and saw Zarathustra standing trembling. 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra," he began, with sorrowful voice, "thou dost 
\par not stand there like one whose happiness maketh him giddy: 
\par thou wilt have to dance lest thou tumble down! 
\par 
\par But although thou shouldst dance before me, and leap all thy 
\par side-leaps, no one may say unto me: Behold, here danceth the 
\par last joyous man! 
\par 
\par In vain would any one come to this height who sought him 
\par here: caves would he find, indeed, and back-caves, hiding- 
\par places for hidden ones; but not lucky mines, nor treasure* 
\par chambers, nor new gold-veins of happiness. 
\par 
\par Happiness how indeed could one find happiness among 
\par such buried-alive and solitary ones! Must I yet seek the last 
\par happiness on the Happy Isles, and far away among forgotten 
\par seas? 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 270 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par But all is alike, nothing is worth while, no seeking is of 
\par service, there are no longer any Happy Isies! ;? 
\par 
\par Thus sighed the soothsayer; with his last sigh, however, 
\par Zarathustra again became serene and assured, like one who 
\par hath come out of a deep chasm into the light. "Nay! Nay! 
\par Three times Nay!" exclaimed he with a strong voice, and 
\par stroked his beard "that do I know better! There are still 
\par Happy Isles! Silence thereon, thou sighing sorrow-sack! 
\par 
\par Cease to splash thereon, thou rain-cloud of the forenoon! 
\par Do I not already stand here wet with thy misery, and drenched 
\par like a dog? 
\par 
\par Now do I shake myself and run away from thee, that I may 
\par again become dry: thereat mayest thou not wonder! Do I seem 
\par to thee discourteous? Here however is my court. 
\par 
\par But as regards the higher man: well! I shall seek him at 
\par once in those forests: from thence came his cry. Perhaps he is 
\par there hard beset by an evil beast. 
\par 
\par He is in my domain: therein shall he receive no scath! And 
\par verily, there are many evil beasts about me." 
\par 
\par With those words Zarathustra turned around to depart. 
\par Then said the soothsayer: "O Zarathustra, thou art a rogue! 
\par 
\par I know it well: thou wouldst fain be rid of me! Rather 
\par wouldst thou run into the forest and lay snares for evil beasts! 
\par 
\par But what good will it do thee? In the evening wilt thou have 
\par me again: in thine own cave will I sit, patient and heavy like a 
\par block and wait for thee!" 
\par 
\par "So be it!" shouted back Zarathustra, as he went away: "and 
\par what is mine in my cave belongeth also unto thee. my guest! 
\par 
\par Shouldst thou however find honey therein, well! just lick it 
\par up, thou growling bear, and sweeten thy soul! For in the eve 
\par ning we want both to be in good spirits;

\par TALK WITH THE KINGS 271 
\par 
\par In good spirits and joyful, because this day hath come to 
\par an end! And thou thyself shalt dance to my lays, as my dancing- 
\par bear. 
\par 
\par Thou dost not believe this? Thou shakest thy head? Well! 
\par Cheer up, old bear! But I also am a soothsayer." 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 65. Talk with the Kings 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par ERE Zarathustra had been an hour on his way in the moun 
\par tains and forests, he saw all at once a strange procession. Right 
\par on the path which he was about to descend came two kings 
\par walking, bedecked with crowns and purple girdles, and varie 
\par gated like flamingoes: they drove before them a laden ass. 
\par "What do these kings want in my domain?" said Zarathustra 
\par in astonishment to his heart, and hid himself hastily behind a 
\par thicket. When however the kings approached to him, he said 
\par half -aloud, like one speaking only to himself: "Strange! 
\par Strange! How doth this harmonise? Two kings do I see and 
\par only one ass!" 
\par 
\par Thereupon the two kings made a halt; they smiled and 
\par looked towards the spot whence the voice proceeded, and 
\par afterwards looked into each other s faces. "Such things do we 
\par also think among ourselves," said the king on the right, "but 
\par we do not utter them." 
\par 
\par The king on the left, however, shrugged his shoulders and 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 272 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par answered: "That may perhaps be a goat-herd. Or an anchorite 
\par who hath lived too long among rocks and trees. For no society 
\par at all spoileth also good manners." 
\par 
\par "Good manners?" replied angrily and bitterly the other 
\par king: "what then do we run out of the way of? Is it not good 
\par manners ? Our good society ? 
\par 
\par Better, verily, to live among anchorites and goat-herds, than 
\par with our gilded, false, over-rouged populace though it call 
\par itself good society. 
\par 
\par Though it call itself nobility. But there all is false and 
\par foul, above all the blood thanks to old evil diseases and 
\par worse curers. 
\par 
\par The best and dearest to me at present is still a sound peasant, 
\par coarse, artful, obstinate and enduring: that is at present the 
\par noblest type. 
\par 
\par The peasant is at present the best; and the peasant type 
\par should be master! But it is the kingdom of the populace I no 
\par longer allow anything to be imposed upon me. The populace, 
\par however that meaneth, hodgepodge. 
\par 
\par Populace-hodgepodge: therein is everything mixed with 
\par everything, saint and swindler, gentleman and Jew, and every 
\par beast out of Noah s ark. 
\par 
\par Good manners! Everything is false and foul with us. No 
\par one knoweth any longer how to reverence: it is that precisely 
\par that we run away from. They are fulsome obtrusive dogs; they 
\par gild palm-leaves. 
\par 
\par This loathing choketh me, that we kings ourselves have be 
\par come false, draped and disguised with the old faded pomp of 
\par our ancestors, show-pieces for the stupidest, the craftiest, and 
\par whosoever at present trafficketh for power. 
\par 
\par We are not the first men and have nevertheless to stand for 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par TALK WITH THE KINGS 273 
\par 
\par them: of this imposture have we at last become weary and 
\par disgusted. 
\par 
\par From the rabble have we gone out of the way, from all those 
\par bawlers and scribe-blowflies, from the trader-stench, the ambi 
\par tion-fidgeting, the bad breath : fie, to live among the rabble; 
\par 
\par Fie, to stand for the first men among the rabble! Ah, 
\par loathing! Loathing! Loathing! What doth it now matter about 
\par us kings!" 
\par 
\par "Thine old sickness seizeth thee," said here the king on the 
\par left, "thy loathing seizeth thee, my poor brother. Thou 
\par knowest, however, that some one heareth us." 
\par 
\par Immediately thereupon, Zarathustra, who had opened ears 
\par and eyes to this talk, rose from his hiding-place, advanced 
\par towards the kings, and thus began: 
\par 
\par "He who hearkeneth unto you, he who gladly hearkeneth 
\par unto you, is called Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par I am Zarathustra who once said : What doth it now matter 
\par about kings! Forgive me; I rejoiced when ye said to each 
\par other: What doth it matter about us kings! 
\par 
\par Here, however, is my domain and jurisdiction: what may ye 
\par be seeking in my domain? Perhaps, however, ye have found on 
\par your way what / seek: namely, the higher man." 
\par 
\par When the kings heard this, they beat upon their breasts and 
\par said with one voice: "We are recognised! 
\par 
\par With the sword of thine utterance severest thou the thickest 
\par darkness of our hearts. Thou hast discovered our distress; for 
\par lo! we are on our way to find the higher man 
\par 
\par The man that is higher than we, although we are kings. 
\par To him do we convey this ass. For the highest man shall also 
\par be the highest lord on earth. 
\par 
\par There is no sorer misfortune in all human destiny, than 
\par when the mighty of the earth are not also the first men. Then 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 274 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par everything becometh false and distorted and monstrous. 
\par 
\par And when they are even the last men, and more beast than 
\par man, then riseth and riseth the populace in honour, and at last 
\par saith even the populace- virtue: Lo, I alone am virtue! " 
\par 
\par What have I just heard? answered Zarathustra. What wis 
\par dom in kings! I am enchanted, and verily, I have already 
\par promptings to make a rhyme thereon: 
\par 
\par Even if it should happen to be a rhyme not suited for 
\par every one s ears. I unlearned long ago to have consideration 
\par for long ears. Well then! Well now! 
\par 
\par ( Here, however, it happened that the ass also found utter 
\par ance: it said distinctly and with malevolence, Y-E-A.) 
\par 
\par Twas once methinks year one of our blessed Lord, 
\par Drunk without wine, the Sybil thus deplored: 
\par "How ill things go! 
\par 
\par Decline! Decline! Ne er sank the world so low! 
\par Rome now hath turned harlot and harlot-stew, 
\par Rome s Caesar a beast, and God hath turned Jew!" 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par With those rhymes of Zarathustra the kings were delighted; 
\par the king on the right, however, said: "O Zarathustra, how 
\par well it was that we set out to see thee! 
\par 
\par For thine enemies showed us thy likeness in their mirror: 
\par there lookedst thou with the grimace ot a devil, and sneer- 
\par ingly: so that we were afraid of thee. 
\par 
\par But what good did it do! Always didst thou prick us anew 
\par in heart and ear with thy sayings. Then did we say at last: 
\par What doth it matter how he look! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par TALK WITH THE KINGS 2/5 
\par 
\par We must hear him; him who teacheth: Ye shall love peace 
\par as a means to new wars, and the short peace more than the 
\par long! 
\par 
\par No one ever spake such warlike words: What is good? To 
\par be brave is good. It is the good war that halloweth every 
\par cause. 
\par 
\par O Zarathustra, our fathers blood stirred in our veins at 
\par such words : it was like the voice of spring to old wine-casks. 
\par 
\par When the swords ran among one another like red-spotted 
\par serpents, then did our fathers become fond of life; the sun of 
\par every peace seemed to them languid and lukewarm, the long 
\par peace, however, made them ashamed. 
\par 
\par How they sighed, our fathers, when they saw on the wall 
\par brightly furbished, dried-up swords! Like those they thirsted 
\par for war. For a sword thirsteth to drink blood, and sparkleth 
\par with desire. "- 
\par 
\par When the kings thus discoursed and talked eagerly of the 
\par happiness of their fathers, there came upon Zarathustra no 
\par little desire to mock at their eagerness: for evidently they were 
\par very peaceable kings whom he saw before him, kings with 
\par old and refined features. But he restrained himself. "Well!" 
\par said he, "thither leadeth the way, there lieth the cave of Zara 
\par thustra; and this day is to have a long evening! At present, 
\par however, a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from you. 
\par 
\par It will honour my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it 
\par but, to be sure, ye will have to wait long! 
\par 
\par Well! What of that! Where doth one at present learn 
\par better to wait than at courts? And the whole virtue of kings 
\par that hath remained unto them is it not called to-day: Ability 
\par to wait?" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra,

\par 
\par 
\par 2j6 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par 64. The Leech 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AND Zarathustra went thoughtfully on, further and lower 
\par down, through forests and past moory bottoms; as it hap- 
\par peneth, however, to every one who meditateth upon hara 
\par matters, he trod thereby unawares upon a man. And lo, there 
\par spurted into his face all at once a cry of pain, and two curses 
\par and twenty bad invectives, so that in his fright he raised his 
\par stick and also struck the trodden one. Immediately afterwards, 
\par however, he regained his composure, and his heart laughed at 
\par the folly he had just committed. 
\par 
\par "Pardon me," said he to the trodden one, who had got up 
\par enraged, and had seated himself, "pardon me, and hear first 
\par of all a parable. 
\par 
\par As a wanderer who dreameth of remote things on a lone 
\par some highway, runneth unawares against a sleeping dog, a dog 
\par which lieth in the sun : 
\par 
\par As both of them then start up and snap at each other, like 
\par deadly enemies, those two beings mortally frightened so 
\par did it happen unto us. 
\par 
\par And yet! And yet how little was lacking for them to 
\par caress each other, that dog and that lonesome one! Are they 
\par not both lonesome ones!" 
\par 
\par -"Whoever thou art," said the trodden one, still enraged, 
\par "thou treadest also too nigh me with thy parable, and not only 
\par with thy foot! 
\par 
\par Lo! am I then a dog?" And thereupon the sitting one got 
\par up, and pulled his naked arm out of the swamp. For at first 
\par he had Jain outstretched on the ground, hidden and indis 
\par cernible, like those who lie in wait for swamp-game. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE LEECH 277 
\par 
\par "But whatever art thou about!" called out Zaathustra in 
\par alarm, for he saw a deal of blood streaming over the naked 
\par arm, "what hath hurt thee? Hath an evil beast bit thee 
\par thou unfortunate one?" 
\par 
\par The bleeding one laughed, still angry, "What matter is it 
\par to thee!" said he, and was about to go on. "Here am I at home 
\par and in my province. Let him question me whoever will: to a 
\par dolt, however, I shall hardly answer." 
\par 
\par "Thou art mistaken," said Zarathustra sympathetically, and 
\par held him fast; "thou art mistaken. Here thou art not at home, 
\par but in my domain, and therein shall no one receive any hurt. 
\par 
\par Call me however what thou wilt I am who I must be. I 
\par call myself Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par Well! Up thither is the way to Zarathustra s cave: it is not 
\par far, wilt thou not attend to thy wounds at my home? 
\par 
\par It hath gone badly with thee, thou unfortunate one, in this 
\par life: first a beast bit thee, and then a man trod upon 
\par thee!"- 
\par 
\par When however the trodden one had heard the name of 
\par Zarathustra he was transformed. "What happeneth unto me!" 
\par he exclaimed, "who preoccupieth me so much in this life as 
\par this one man, namely Zarathustra, and that one animal that 
\par liveth on blood, the leech? 
\par 
\par For the sake of the leech did I lie here by this swamp, like 
\par a fisher, and already had mine outstretched arm been bitten 
\par ten times, when there biteth a still finer leech at my blood, 
\par Zarathustra himself! 
\par 
\par O happiness! O miracle! Praised be this day which enticed 
\par me into the swamp! Praised be the best, the livest cupping- 
\par glass, that at present liveth; praised be the great conscience- 
\par leech Zarathustra!" 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 1*78 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Thus spake the trodden one, and Zarathustra rejoiced at his 
\par words and their refined reverential style. "Who art thou?" 
\par asked he, and gave him his hand, "there is much to clear up 
\par and elucidate between us, but already methinketh pure clear 
\par day is dawning." 
\par 
\par "I am the spiritually conscientious one," answered he who 
\par was asked, "and in matters of the spirit it is difficult for any one 
\par to take it more rigorously, more restrictedly, and more severely 
\par than I, except him from whom I learnt it, Zarathustra himself. 
\par 
\par Better know nothing than half -know many things! Better 
\par be a fool on one s own account, than a sage on other people s 
\par approbation! I go to the basis: 
\par 
\par What matter if it be great or small? If it be called swamp 
\par or sky? A handbreadth of basis is enough for me, if it be 
\par actually basis and ground! 
\par 
\par A handbreadth of basis: thereon can one stand. In the true 
\par knowing-knowledge there is nothing great and nothing 
\par small." 
\par 
\par "Then thou art perhaps an expert on the leech?" asked 
\par Zarathustra; "and thou investigatest the leech to its ultimate 
\par basis, thou conscientious one?" 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra," answered the trodden one, "that would be 
\par something immense; how could I presume to do so! 
\par 
\par That, however, of which I am master and knower, is the 
\par brain of the leech: that is my world! 
\par 
\par And it is also a world! Forgive it, however, that my pride 
\par here findeth expression, for here I have not mine equal. There 
\par fore said I : here am I at home. 
\par 
\par How long have I investigated this one thing, the brain of 
\par the leech, so that here the slippery truth might no longer slip 
\par from me! Here is my domain! 
\par 
\par For the sake of this did I cast everything else aside, for 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE LEECH 279 
\par 
\par the sake of this did everything else become indifferent to me; 
\par and close beside my knowledge lieth my black ignorance. 
\par 
\par My spiritual conscience requireth from me that it should 
\par be so that I should know one thing, and not know all else: 
\par they are a loathing unto me, all the semi-spiritual, all the hazy, 
\par hovering, and visionary. 
\par 
\par Where mine honesty ceaseth, there am I blind, and want 
\par also to be blind. Where I want to know, however, there want 
\par I also to be honest namely, severe, rigorous, restricted, cruel 
\par and inexorable. 
\par 
\par Because thou once saidest, O Zarathustra: Spirit is life 
\par which itself cutteth into life ; that led and allured me to 
\par thy doctrine. And verily, with mine own blood have I in 
\par creased mine own knowledge!" 
\par 
\par -"As the evidence indicateth," broke in Zarathustra; for 
\par still was the blood flowing down on the naked arm of the 
\par conscientious one. For there had ten leeches bitten into it. 
\par 
\par "O thou strange fellow, how much doth this very evidence 
\par teach me namely, thou thyself! And not all, perhaps, might 
\par I pour into thy rigorous ear! 
\par 
\par Well then! We part here! But I would fain find thee again. 
\par Up thither is the way to my cave: to-night shalt thou there 
\par by my welcome guest! 
\par 
\par Fain would I also make amends to thy body for Zarathustra 
\par treading upon thee with his feet: I think about that. Just now, 
\par however, a cry of distress calleth me hastily away from thee/"

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHEN however Zarathustra had gone round a rock, then saw 
\par he on the same path, not far below him, a man who threw his 
\par limbs about like a maniac, and at last tumbled to the ground 
\par on his belly. "Halt!" said then Zarathustra to his heart, "he 
\par there must surely be the higher man, from him came that 
\par dreadful cry of distress, I will see if I can help him." When, 
\par however, he ran to the spot where the man lay on the ground, 
\par he found a trembling old man with fixed eyes; and in spite of 
\par all Zarathustra s efforts to lift him and set him again on his 
\par feet, it was all in vain. The unfortunate one, also, did not seem 
\par to notice that some one was beside him; on the contrary, he 
\par continually looked around with moving gestures, like one for 
\par saken and isolated from all the world. At last, however, after

\par Here, however, Zarathustra could no longer restrain him 
\par self; he took his staff and struck the wailer with all his might. 
\par "Stop this," cried he to him with wrathful laughter, "stop this,

\par 
\par I will soon make warm legs to thee, thou evil magician: I

\par 
\par "Leave off," said the old man, and sprang up from the 
\par ground, "strike me no more, O Zarathustra! I did it only for 
\par amusement! 
\par 
\par That kind of thing belongeth to mine art. Thee thyself, I 
\par wanted to put to the proof when I gave this performance. And 
\par verily, thou hast well detected me! 
\par 
\par But thou thyself hast given me no small proof of thyself: 
\par thou art hard, thou wise Zarathustra! Hard strikest thou with 
\par thy truths, thy cudgel forceth from me this truth!" 
\par 
\par "Flatter not," answered Zarathustra, still excited and 
\par frowning, "thou stage-player from the heart! Thou art false: 
\par why speakest thou of truth! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE MAGICIAN 285 
\par 
\par Thou peacock of peacocks, thou sea of vanity; what didst 
\par thou represent before me, thou evil magician; whom was J 
\par meant to believe in when thou wailedst in such wise?" 
\par 
\par "The penitent in spirit," said the old man, "it was him 1 
\par represented; thou thyself once devisedst this expression 
\par 
\par The poet and magician who at last turneth his spirit 
\par against himself, the transformed one who freezeth to death 
\par by his bad science and conscience. 
\par 
\par And just acknowledge it: it was long, O Zarathustra, be 
\par fore thou discoveredst my trick and lie! Thou believedst in my 
\par distress when thou heldest my head with both thy hands, 
\par 
\par I heard thee lament we have loved him too little, loved 
\par him too little! Because I so far deceived thee, my wickedness 
\par rejoiced in me." 
\par 
\par "Thou mayest have deceived subtler ones than I," said Zara 
\par thustra sternly. "I am not on my guard against deceivers; I 
\par have to be without precaution : so willeth my lot. 
\par 
\par Thou, however, must deceive: so far do I know thee! Thou 
\par must ever be equivocal, trivocal, quadrivocal, and quinqui- 
\par vocal! Even what thou hast now confessed, is not nearly true 
\par enough nor false enough for me! 
\par 
\par Thou bad false coiner, how couldst thou do otherwise! Thy 
\par very malady wouldst thou whitewash if thou showed thyself 
\par naked to thy physician. 
\par 
\par Thus didst thou whitewash thy lie before me when thou 
\par saidst: T did so only for amusement! There was also serious 
\par ness therein, thou art something of a penitent-in-spirit! 
\par 
\par I divine thee well: thou hast become the enchanter of all 
\par the world; but for thyself thou hast no lie or artifice left, 
\par thou art disenchanted to thyself! 
\par 
\par Thou hast reaped disgust as thy one truth. No word in thee

\par 
\par 286 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par is any longer genuine, but thy mouth is so: that is to say, the 
\par disgust that cleaveth unto thy mouth." 
\par 
\par "Who art thou at all!" cried here the old magician with 
\par defiant voice, "who dareth to speak thus unto me, the greatest 
\par man now living?" and a green flash shot from his eye at 
\par Zarathustra. But immediately after he changed, and said sadly: 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra, I am weary of it, I am disgusted with mine 
\par arts, I am not great, why do I dissemble! But thou knowest 
\par it well 1 sought for greatness! 
\par 
\par A great man I wanted to appear, and persuaded many; but 
\par the lie hath been beyond my power. On it do I collapse. 
\par 
\par O Zarathustra, everything is a lie in me; but that I collapse 
\par this my collapsing is genuine!" 
\par 
\par "It honoureth thee," said Zarathustra gloomily, looking 
\par down with sidelong glance, "it honoureth thee that thou 
\par soughtest for greatness, but it betrayeth thee also. Thou art not 
\par great. 
\par 
\par Thou bad old magician, that is the best and the honestest 
\par thing I honour in thee, that thou hast become weary of thy 
\par self, and hast expressed it: I am not great. 
\par 
\par Therein do I honour thee as a penitent-in-spirit, and 
\par although only for the twinkling of an eye, in that one moment 
\par wast thou genuine. 
\par 
\par But tell me, what seekest thou here in my forests and rocks? 
\par And if thou hast put thyself in my way, what proof of me 
\par wouldst thou have? 
\par 
\par Wherein didst thou put me to the test?" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra, and his eyes sparkled. But the old 
\par magician kept silence for a while; then said he: "Did I put thee 
\par to the test? I seek only. 
\par 
\par O Zarathustra, I seek a genuine one, a right one, a simple 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE MAGICIAN 287 
\par 
\par one, an unequivocal one, a man of perfect honesty, a vessel of 
\par wisdom, a saint of knowledge, a great man! 
\par 
\par Knowest thou it not, O Zarathustra? / seek Zarathustra." 
\par 
\par And here there arose a long silence between them: Zara 
\par thustra, however, became profoundly absorbed in thought, so 
\par that he shut his eyes. But afterwards coming back to the situa 
\par tion, he grasped the hand of the magician, and said, full of 
\par politeness and policy: 
\par 
\par "Well! Up thither leadeth the way, there is the cave of 
\par Zarathustra. In it mayest thou seek him whom thou wouldst 
\par fain find. 
\par 
\par And ask counsel of mine animals, mine eagle and my se? 
\par pent: they shall help thee to seek. My cave however is large. 
\par 
\par I myself, to be sure I have as yet seen no great man. That 
\par which is great, the acutest eye is at present insensible to it. It 
\par is the kingdom of the populace. 
\par 
\par Many a one have I found who stretched and inflated him 
\par self, and the people cried: Behold; a great man! But what 
\par good do all bellows do! The wind cometh out at last. 
\par 
\par At last bursteth the frog which hath inflated itself too long: 
\par then cometh out the wind. To prick a swollen one in the belly, 
\par I call good pastime. Hear that, ye boys! 
\par 
\par Our today is of the popular: who still knoweth what is 
\par great and what is small! Who could there seek successfully for 
\par greatness! A fool only: it succeedeth with fools. 
\par 
\par Thou seekest for great men, thou strange fool? Who taught 
\par that to thee? Is today the time for it? Oh, thou bad seeker, why 
\par dost thou tempt me?" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra, comforted in his heart, and went 
\par 
\par laughing on his way. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 288 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par 66. Out of Service 
\par 
\par NOT long, however, after Zarathustra had freed hi^elf from 
\par the magician, he again saw a person sitting beside the path 
\par which he followed, namely a tall, black man, with a haggard, 
\par pale countenance: this man grieved him exceedingly. "Alas," 
\par said he to his heart, "there sitteth disguised affliction; me- 
\par thinketh he is of the type of the priests: what do they want in 
\par my domain? 
\par 
\par What! Hardly have I escaped from that magician, and must 
\par another necromancer again run across my path, 
\par 
\par Some sorcerer with laying-on-of -hands, some sombre 
\par wonder-worker by the grace of God, some anointed world- 
\par maligner, whom, may the devil take! 
\par 
\par But the devil is never at the place which would be his right 
\par place: he always cometh too late, that cursed dwarf and club- 
\par foot!" 
\par 
\par Thus cursed Zarathustra impatiently in his heart, and con 
\par sidered how with averted look he might slip past the black 
\par man. But behold, it came about otherwise. For at the same 
\par moment had the sitting one already perceived him; and not 
\par unlike one whom an unexpected happiness overtaketh, he 
\par sprang to his feet, and went straight towards Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par Whoever thou art, thou traveller," said he, "help a strayed 
\par one, a seeker, an old man, who may here easily come to grief! 
\par 
\par The world here is strange to me, and remote; wild beasts 
\par also did I hear howling; and he who could have given me pro* 
\par tection he is himself no more. 
\par 
\par I was seeking the last pious man, a saint and an anchorite, 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par OUT OF SERVICE 289 
\par 
\par who, alone in his forest, had not yet heard D what all the 
\par world knoweth at present." 
\par 
\par "What doth all the world know at present?" asked Zara- 
\par thustra. "Perhaps that the old God no longer liveth, in whom 
\par all the world once believed?" 
\par 
\par "Thou sayest it," answered the old man sorrowfully. "And 
\par I served that old God until his last hour. 
\par 
\par Now, however, am I out of service, without master, and yet 
\par not free; likewise am I no longer merry even for an hour, 
\par except it be in recollections. 
\par 
\par Therefore did I ascend into these mountains, that I might 
\par finally have a festival for myself once more, as becometh an 
\par old pope and church-father: for know it, that I am the last 
\par pope! a festival of pious recollections and divine services. 
\par 
\par Now, however, is he himself dead, the most pious of men, 
\par the saint in the forest, who praised his God constantly with 
\par singing and mumbling. 
\par 
\par He himself found I no longer when I found his cot but 
\par two wolves found I therein, which howled on account of his 
\par death, for all animals loved him. Then did I haste away. 
\par 
\par Had I thus come in vain into these forests and mountains? 
\par Then did my heart determine that I should seek another, the 
\par most pious of all those who believe not in God , my heart 
\par determined that I should seek Zarathustra!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake the hoary man, and gazed with keen eyes at him 
\par who stood before him. Zarathustra however seized the hand 
\par of the old pope and regarded it a long while with admiration. 
\par 
\par "Lo! thou venerable one," said he then, "what a fine and 
\par long hand! That is the hand of one who hath ever dispensed 
\par blessings. Now, however, doth it hold fast him whom thou 
\par seekest me, Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 290 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par It is I, the ungodly Zarathustra, who saith: Who is un- 
\par godlier than I, that I may enjoy his teaching? " 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra, and penetrated with his glances 
\par the thoughts and arrear-thoughts of the old pope. At last the 
\par latter began: 
\par 
\par "He who most loved and possessed him hath now also lost 
\par him most : 
\par 
\par Lo, I myself am surely the most godless of us at present? 
\par But who could rejoice at that!" 
\par 
\par "Thou servedst him to the last?" asked Zarathustra 
\par thoughtfully, after a deep silence, "thou knowest how he 
\par died? Is it true what they say, that sympathy choked him; 
\par 
\par That he saw how man hung on the cross, and could not 
\par endure it; that his love to man became his hell, and at last his 
\par death?"- 
\par 
\par The old pope however did not answer, but looked aside 
\par timidly, with a painful and gloomy expression. 
\par 
\par "Let him go," said Zarathustra, after prolonged meditation, 
\par still looking the old man straight in the eye. 
\par 
\par "Let him go, he is gone. And though it honoureth thee that 
\par thou speakest only in praise of this dead one, yet thou knowest 
\par as well as I who he was, and that he went curious ways." 
\par 
\par "To speak before three eyes," said the old pope cheerfully 
\par (he was blind of one eye), "in divine matters I am more en 
\par lightened than Zarathustra himself and may well be so. 
\par 
\par My love served him long years, my will followed all his will. 
\par A good servant, however, knoweth everything, and many a 
\par thing even which a master hideth from himself. 
\par 
\par He was a hidden God, full of secrecy. Verily, he did not 
\par come by his son otherwise than by secret ways. At the door of 
\par his faith standeth adultery. 
\par 
\par Whoever extolleth him as a God of love, doth not think 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par OUT OF SERVICE 29! 
\par 
\par highly enough of love itself. Did not that God want also to 
\par be judge? But the loving one loveth irrespective of reward 
\par and requital. 
\par 
\par When he was young, that God out of the Orient, then was 
\par he harsh and revengeful, and built himself a hell for the 
\par delight of his favourites. 
\par 
\par At last, however, he became old and soft and mellow and 
\par pitiful, more like a grandfather than a father, but most like 
\par a tottering old grandmother. 
\par 
\par There did he sit shrivelled in his chimney-corner, fretting 
\par on account of his weak legs, world-weary, will-weary, and one 
\par day he suffocated of his all-too-great pity."- 
\par 
\par Thou old pope," said here Zarathustra interposing, "hast 
\par thou seen thai with thine eyes? It could well have happened 
\par in that way: in that way, and also otherwise. When gods die 
\par they always die many kinds of death. 
\par 
\par Weil! At all events, one way or other he is gone! He was 
\par counter to the taste of mine ears and eyes; worse than that I 
\par should not like to say against him. 
\par 
\par I love everything that looketh bright and speaketh honestly. 
\par But he thou knowest it, forsooth, thou old priest, there was 
\par something of thy type in him, the priest- type he was equivo 
\par cal. 
\par 
\par He was also indistinct. How he raged at us, this wrath- 
\par snorter, because we understood him badly! But why did he 
\par not speak more clearly? 
\par 
\par And if the fault lay in our ears, why did he give us ears that 
\par heard him badly? If there was dirt in our ears, well! who put 
\par it in them? 
\par 
\par Too much miscarried with him, this potter who had not 
\par learned thoroughly! That he took revenge on his pots and 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 292 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par creations, however, because they turned out badly that was a 
\par sin against good taste. 
\par 
\par There is also good taste in piety: this at last said : Away with 
\par such a God! Better to have no God, better to set up destiny on 
\par one s own account, better to be a fool, better to be God 
\par oneself! 
\par 
\par "What do I hear!" said then the old pope, with intent 
\par ears; "O Zarathustra, thou art more pious than thou believest, 
\par with such an unbelief! Some god in thee hath converted thee 
\par to thine ungodliness. 
\par 
\par Is it not thy piety itself which no longer letteth thee be 
\par lieve in a God? And thine over-great honesty will yet lead 
\par thee even beyond good and evil! 
\par 
\par Behold, what hath been reserved for thee? Thou hast eyes 
\par and hands and mouth, which have been predestined for bless 
\par ing from eternity. One doth not bless with the hand alone. 
\par 
\par Nigh unto thee, though thou professest to be the ungod- 
\par liest one, I feel a hale and holy odour of long benedictions : I 
\par feel glad and grieved thereby. 
\par 
\par Let me be thy guest, O Zarathustra, for a single night! 
\par Nowhere on earth shall I now feel better than with thee!" 
\par 
\par "Amen! So shall it be!" said Zarathustra, with great aston 
\par ishment; "up thither leadeth the way, there lieth the cave of 
\par Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par Gladly, forsooth, would I conduct thee thither myself, thou 
\par venerable one; for I love all pious men. But now a cry of dis 
\par tress calleth me hastily away from thee. 
\par 
\par In my domain shall no one come to grief; my cave is a 
\par good haven. And best of all would I like to put every sorrowful 
\par one again on firm land and fin^ legs. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE UGLIEST MAN 293 
\par 
\par Who, however, could take thy melancholy off thy shoulders? 
\par For that I am too weak. Long, verily, should we have to wait 
\par until some one re-awoke thy God for thee. 
\par 
\par For that old God liveth no more: he is indeed dead." 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par . The Ugliest Man 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AND again did Zarathustra s feet run through mountains 
\par and forests, and his eyes sought and sought, but nowhere was 
\par he to be seen whom they wanted to see the sorely distressed 
\par sufferer and crier. On the whole way, however, he rejoiced in 
\par his heart and was full of gratitude. "What good things," said 
\par he, "hath this day given me, as amends for its bad beginning! 
\par What strange interlocutors have I found! 
\par 
\par At their words will I now chew a long while as at good corn; 
\par small shall my teeth grind and crush them, until they flow like 
\par milk into my soul!" 
\par 
\par When, however, the path again curved round a rock, all at 
\par once the landscape changed, and Zarathustra entered into a 
\par realm of death. Here bristled aloft black and red cliffs, with 
\par out any grass, tree, or bird s voice. For it was a valley which all 
\par animals avoided, even the beasts of prey, except that a species 
\par of ugly, thick, green serpent came here to die when they be 
\par came old. Therefore the shepherds called this valley: "Serpent- 
\par death." 
\par 
\par Zarathustra, however, became absorbed in dark recollec 
\par tions, for it seemed to him as if he had once before stood in 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 294 THUS .PAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par this valley. And much heaviness settled on his mind, so that 
\par he walked slowly and always more slowly, and at last stood 
\par still. Then, however, when he opened his eyes, he saw some 
\par thing sitting by the wayside shaped like a man, and hardly 
\par like a man, something nondescript. And all at once there came 
\par over Zarathustra a great shame, because he had gazed on such 
\par a thing. Blushing up to the very roots of his white hair, he 
\par turned aside his glance, and raised his foot that he might 
\par leave this ill-starred place. Then, however, became the dead 
\par wilderness vocal: for from the ground a noise welled up, 
\par gurgling and rattling, as water gurgleth and rartleth at night 
\par through stopped-up water-pipes; and at last it turned into 
\par human voice and human speech: it sounded thus: 
\par 
\par "Zarathustra! Zarathustra! Read my riddle! Say, say! What 
\par is the revenge on the witness? 
\par 
\par I entice thee back; here is smooth ice! See to it, see to it, 
\par that thy pride does not here break its legs! 
\par 
\par Thou thinkest thyself wise, thou proud Zarathustra! Read 
\par then the riddle, thou hard nut-cracker, the riddle that I am! 
\par Say then : who am I!" 
\par 
\par When however Zarathustra had heard these words, 
\par what think ye then took place in his soul? Pity overcame him; 
\par and he sank down all at once, like an oak that hath long with 
\par stood many tree-fellers, heavily, suddenly, to the terror even 
\par of those who meant to fell it. But immediately he got up 
\par again from the ground, and his countenance became stern. 
\par 
\par "I know thee well," said he, with a brazen voice, "thou art 
\par the murderer of God! Let me go. 
\par 
\par Thou couldst not endure him who beheld thee, who ever 
\par beheld thee through and through, thou ugliest man. Thou 
\par tookest revenge on this witness!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra and was about to go; but the non- 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE UGLIEST MAN 295 
\par 
\par descript grasped at a corner of his garment and began anew 
\par to gurgle and seek for words. "Stay," said he at last 
\par 
\par "Stay! Do not pass by! I have divined what axe it was 
\par that struck thee to the ground : hail to thee, O Zarathustra, that 
\par thou art again upon thy feet! 
\par 
\par Thou hast divined, I know it well, how the man f eeleth who 
\par killed him, the murderer of God. Stay! Sit down here be 
\par side me; it is not to no purpose. 
\par 
\par To whom would I go but unto thee? Stay, sit down! Do not 
\par however look at me! Honour thus mine ugliness! 
\par 
\par They persecute me: now art thou my last refuge. Not with 
\par their hatred, not with their bailiffs; Oh, such persecution 
\par would I mock at, and be proud and cheerful! 
\par 
\par Hath not all success hitherto been with the well-persecuted 
\par ones? And he who persecuteth well learneth readily to be 
\par ob sequent when once he is put behind! But it is their pity 
\par 
\par Their pity is it from which I flee away and flee to thee. O 
\par Zarathustra, protect me, thou, my last refuge, thou sole one 
\par whodivinedstme: 
\par 
\par Thou hast divined how the mail f eeleth who killed him. 
\par Stay! And if thou wilt go, thou impatient one, go not the way 
\par that I came. That way is bad. 
\par 
\par Art thou angry with me because I have already racked lan 
\par guage too long? Because I have already counselled thee? But 
\par know that it is I, the ugliest man, 
\par 
\par Who have also the largest, heaviest feet. Where 7 have 
\par gone, the way is bad. I tread all paths to death and destruction. 
\par 
\par But that thou passedst me by in silence, that thou blushedst 
\par I saw it well: thereby did I know thee as Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par Every one else would have thrown to me his alms, his pity, 
\par in look and speech. But for that I am not beggar enough: 
\par didst thou divine. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 296 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par For that I am too rich, rich in what if fcreat, frightful, 
\par ugliest, most unutterable! Thy shame, O Zarathustra, honoured 
\par me! 
\par 
\par With difficulty did I get out of the crowd of the pitiful, 
\par that I might find the only one who at present teacheth that pity 
\par is obtrusive thyself, O Zarathustra! 
\par 
\par Whether it be the pity of a God, or whether it be human 
\par pity, it is offensive to modesty. And unwillingness to help may 
\par be nobler than the virtue that rusheth to do so. 
\par 
\par That however namely, pity is called virtue itself at 
\par present by all petty people; they have no reverence for great 
\par misfortune, great ugliness, great failure. 
\par 
\par Beyond all these do I look, as a dog looketh over the backs 
\par of thronging flocks of sheep. They are petty, good-wooled, 
\par good-willed, grey people.

\par As the heron looketh contemptuously at shallow pools, with 
\par backward-bent head, so do I look at the throng of grey little 
\par waves and wills and souls. 
\par 
\par Too long have we acknowledged them to be right, those 
\par petty people: so we have at last given them power as well; 
\par and now do they teach that good is only wiiat petty people 
\par call good. 
\par 
\par And truth is at present what the preacher spake who him 
\par self sprang from them, that singular saint and advocate of 
\par the petty people, who testified of himself: I am the truth. 
\par 
\par That immodest one hath long made the petty people greatly 
\par puffed up, he who taught no small error when he taught: I 
\par am the truth. 
\par 
\par Hath an immodest one ever been answered more courte 
\par ously? Thou, however, O Zarathustra, passedst him by, and 
\par saidst: Nay! Nay! Three times Nay! 
\par 
\par Thou warnedst against his error; thou warnedst the first 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE UGLIEST MAN 297 
\par 
\par to do so against pity: not every one, not none, but thyself 
\par and thy type. 
\par 
\par Thou art ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer; and 
\par verily when thou sayest: From pity there cometh a heavy 
\par cloud; take heed, ye men! 
\par 
\par When thou teachest: All creators are hard, all great love 
\par is beyond their pity: O Zarathustra, how well versed dost 
\par thou seem to me in weather-signs! 
\par 
\par Thou thyself, however, warn thyself also against thy pity! 
\par For many are on their way to thee, many suffering, doubting, 
\par despairing, drowning, freezing ones 
\par 
\par I warn thee also against myself. Thou hast read my best, my 
\par worst riddle, myself, and what I have done. I know the axe that 
\par felleth thee. 
\par 
\par But he had to die: he looked with eyes which beheld 
\par everything, he beheld men s depths and dregs, all his hidden 
\par ignominy and ugliness. 
\par 
\par His pity knew no modesty: he crept into my dirtiest corners. 
\par This most prying, over-intrusive, over-pitiful one had to die. 
\par 
\par He ever beheld me: on such a witness I would have revenge 
\par or not live myself. 
\par 
\par The God who beheld everything, and also man: that God 
\par had to die! Man cannot endure it that such a witness should 
\par live." 
\par 
\par Thus spake the ugliest man. Zarathustra however got up, 
\par and prepared to go on: for he felt frozen to the very bowels. 
\par 
\par "Thou nondescript," said he, "thou warnedst me against 
\par thy path. As thanks for it I praise mine to thee. Behold, up 
\par thither is the cave of Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par My cave is large and deep and hath many corners; there 
\par findeth he that is most hidden his hiding-place. And close be- 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 298 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par side k, there are a hundred lurking-places and by-places tor 
\par creeping, fluttering, and hopping creatures. 
\par 
\par Thou outcast, who hast cast thyself out, thou wilt not live 
\par amongst men and men s pity? Well then, do like me! Thus 
\par wilt thou learn also from me; only the doer learneth. 
\par 
\par And talk first and foremost to mine animals! The proudest 
\par animal and the wisest animal they might well be the right 
\par counsellors for us both!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra and went his way, more thought 
\par fully and slowly even than before: for he asked himself many 
\par things, and hardly knew what to answer. 
\par 
\par "How poor indeed is man," thought he in his heart, "how 
\par ugly, how wheezy, how full of hidden shame! 
\par 
\par They tell me that man loveth himself. Ah, how great must 
\par that self-love be! How much contempt is opposed to it! 
\par 
\par Even this man hath loved himself, as he hath despised him 
\par self, a great lover methinketh he is, and a great despiser. 
\par 
\par No one have I yet found who more thoroughly despised 
\par himself: even that is elevation. Alas, was this perhaps the 
\par higher man whose cry I heard? 
\par 
\par I love the great despisers, Man is something that hath to be 
\par surpassed." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 68. The Voluntary Beggar 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHEN Zarathustra had left the ugliest man, he was chilled and 
\par felt lonesome: for much coldness and lonesomeness came over 
\par his spirit, so that even his limbs became colder thereby. When, 
\par however, he wandered on and on, uphill and down, at times 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR 299 
\par 
\par past green meadows, though also sometimes over wild stony 
\par couches where formerly perhaps an impatient brook had made 
\par its bed, then he turned all at once warmer and heartier again. 
\par 
\par "What hath happened unto me?" he asked himself, "some 
\par thing warm and living quickeneth me; it must be in the neigh 
\par bourhood. 
\par 
\par Already am I less alone; unconscious companions and 
\par brethren rove around me; their warm breath toucheth my 
\par soul." 
\par 
\par When, however, he spied about and sought for the com 
\par forters of his lonesomeness, behold, there were kine there 
\par standing together on an eminence, whose proximity and smell 
\par had warmed his heart. The kine, however, seemed to listen 
\par eagerly to a speaker, and took no heed of him who approached. 
\par When, however, Zarathustra was quite nigh unto them, then 
\par did he hear plainly that a human voice spake in the midst of 
\par the kine, and apparently all of them had turned their heads 
\par towards the speaker. 
\par 
\par Then ran Zarathustra up speedily and drove the animals 
\par aside; for he feared that some one had here met with harm, 
\par which the pity of the kine would hardly be able to relieve. But 
\par in this he was deceived; for behold, there sat a man on the 
\par ground who seemed to be persuading the animals to have no 
\par fear of him, a peaceable man and Preacher-on-the-Mount, out 
\par of whose eyes kindness itself preached. "What dost thou seek 
\par here?" called out Zarathustra in astonishment. 
\par 
\par "What do I here seek?" answered he: "the same that thou 
\par seekest, thou mischief-maker; that is to say, happiness upon 
\par earth. 
\par 
\par To that end, however, I would fain learn of these kine. For 
\par \\ tell thee that I have already talked half a morning unto 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 30O THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par them, and just now were they about to give me their answer. 
\par Why dost thou disturb them? 
\par 
\par Except we be converted and become as kine, we shall in no 
\par wise enter into the kingdom of heaven. For we ought to learn 
\par from them one thing: ruminating. 
\par 
\par And verily, although a man should gain the whole world, 
\par and yet not learn one thing, ruminating, what would it profit 
\par him! He would not be rid of his affliction, 
\par 
\par His great affliction: that, however, is at present called 
\par disgust. Who hath not at present his heart, his mouth and his 
\par eyes full of disgust? Thou also! Thou also! But behold these 
\par kine!"- 
\par 
\par Thus spake the Preacher-on-the-Mount, and turned then his 
\par own look towards Zarathustra for hitherto it had rested 
\par lovingly on the kine : then, however, he put on a different ex 
\par pression. "Who is this with whom I talk?" he exclaimed, 
\par frightened, and sprang up from the ground. 
\par 
\par "This is the man without disgust, this is Zarathustra him 
\par self, the surmounter of the great disgust, this is the eye, this 
\par is the mouth, this is the heart of Zarathustra himself." 
\par 
\par And whilst he thus spake he kissed with o erflowing eyes 
\par the hands of him with whom he spake, and behaved alto 
\par gether like one to whom a precious gift and jewel hath fallen 
\par unawares from heaven. The kine, however, gazed at it all and 
\par wondered. 
\par 
\par "Speak not of me, thou strange one; thou amiable one!" said 
\par Zarathustra, and restrained his affection, "speak to me firstly 
\par of thyself! Art thou not the voluntary beggar who once cast 
\par away great riches, 
\par 
\par Who was ashamed of his riches and of the rich, and fled 
\par to the poorest to bestow upon them his abundance and his 
\par heart? But they received him not," 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE VOLUNTARY BEGGAR 301 
\par 
\par "But they received me not," said the voluntary beggar, thou 
\par knowest it, forsooth. So I went at last to the animals and to 
\par those kine." 
\par 
\par "Then learnedst thou," interrupted Zarathustra, "how much 
\par harder it is to give properly than to take properly, and that be 
\par stowing well is an art the last, subtlest master-art of kind 
\par ness." 
\par 
\par "Especially nowadays," answered the voluntary beggar: "at 
\par present, that is to say, when everything low hath become re 
\par bellious and exclusive and haughty in its manner in the 
\par manner of the populace. 
\par 
\par For the hour hath come, thou knowest it forsooth, for the 
\par great, evil, long, slow mob-and-slave-insurrection: it extendeth 
\par and extendeth! 
\par 
\par Now doth it provoke the lower classes, all benevolence and 
\par petty giving; and the overrich may be on their guard! 
\par 
\par Whoever at present drip, like bulgy bottles out of all-too- 
\par small necks: of such bottles at present one willingly breaketh 
\par the necks. 
\par 
\par Wanton avidity, bilious envy, careworn revenge, populace- 
\par pride: all these struck mine eye. It is no longer true that the 
\par poor are blessed. The kingdom of heaven, however, is with 
\par the kine." 
\par 
\par "And why is it not with the rich?" asked Zarathustra tempt 
\par ingly, while he kept back the kine which sniff ed familiarly at 
\par the peaceful one. 
\par 
\par "Why dost thou tempt me?" answered the other. "Thou 
\par knowest it thyself better even than I. What was it drove me 
\par to the poorest, O Zarathustra? Was it not my disgust at the 
\par richest? 
\par 
\par At the culprits of riches, with cold eyes and rank thoughts, 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par who pick up profit out of all kinds of rubbish at tins rabble 
\par that stinketh to heaven, 
\par 
\par At this gilded, falsified populace, whose fathers were 
\par pickpockets, or carrion-crows, or rag-pickers, with wives com 
\par pliant, lewd and forgetful: for they are all of them not far 
\par different from harlots 
\par 
\par Populace above, populace below! What are poor and rich 
\par at present! That distinction did I unlearn, then did I flee 
\par away further and ever further, until I came to those kine." 
\par 
\par Thus spake the peaceful one, and puffed himself and per 
\par spired with his words : so that the kine wondered anew. Zara- 
\par thustra, however, kept looking into his face with a smile, all 
\par the time the man talked so severely and shook silently his 
\par head. 
\par 
\par "Thou doest violence to thyself, thou Preacher-on-the- 
\par Mount, when thou usest such severe words. For such severity 
\par neither thy mouth nor thine eye have been given thee. 
\par 
\par Nor, methinketh, hath thy stomach either: unto / / all such 
\par rage and hatred and foaming-over is repugnant. Thy stomach 
\par wanteth softer things : thou art not a butcher. 
\par 
\par Rather seemest thou to me a plant-eater and a root-man. 
\par Perhaps thou grindest corn. Certainly, however, thou art averse 
\par to fleshly joys, and thou lovest honey." 
\par 
\par "Thou hast divined me well," answered the voluntary beg 
\par gar, with lightened heart. "I love honey, I also grind corn; for 
\par I have sought out what tasteth sweetly and maketh pure breath : 
\par 
\par Also what recjuireth a long time, a day s- work and a 
\par mouth s- work for gentle idlers and sluggards. 
\par 
\par Furthest, to be sure, have those kine carried it: they have de 
\par vised ruminating and lying in the sun. They also abstain from 
\par all heavy thoughts which inflate the heart." 
\par 
\par "Well!" said Zarathustra, "thou shouldst also see min*

\par Behold, thither leadeth the way to my cave: be tonight its

\par 
\par Until I myself come home. For now a cry of distress 
\par calleth me hastily away from thee. Also, shouldst thou find 
\par new honey with me, ice-cold, golden-comb-honey, eat it! 
\par 
\par Now, however, take leave at once of thy kine, thou strange 
\par one! thou amiable one! though it be hard for thee. For they 
\par are thy warmest friends and preceptors!" 
\par 
\par -"One excepted, whom I hold still dearer," answered the 
\par voluntary beggar. "Thou thyself art good, O Zarathustra, and 
\par better even than a cow!" 
\par 
\par "Away, away with thee! thou evil flatterer!" cried Zarathus 
\par tra mischievously, "why dost thou spoil me with such praise 
\par and flattery-honey? 
\par 
\par "Away, away from me!" cried he once more, and heaved 
\par his stick at the fond beggar, who, however, ran nimbly away. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 69. The Shadow 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par SCARCELY however was the voluntary beggar gone in haste, 
\par and Zarathustra again alone, when he heard behind him a new 
\par voice which called out: "Stay! Zarathustra! Do wait! It if 
\par myself, forsooth, O Zarathustra, myself, thy shadow!" But 
\par Zarathustra did not wait; for a sudden irritation came over 
\par him on account of the crowd and the crowding in his moun 
\par tains. "Whither hath my lonesomeness gone?" spake he. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par "It is verily becoming too much for me; these mountains 
\par swarm; my kingdom is no longer of this world; I require new 
\par mountains. 
\par 
\par My shadow calleth me? What matter about my shadow! Let 
\par it run after me! I run away from it." 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra to his heart and ran away. But the 
\par one behind followed after him, so that immediately there were 
\par three runners, one after the other namely, foremost the 
\par voluntary beggar, then Zarathustra, and thirdly, and hindmost, 
\par his shadow. But not long had they run thus when Zarathustra 
\par became conscious of his folly, and shook off with one jerk all 
\par his irritation and detestation. 
\par 
\par "What!" said he, "have not the most ludicrous things 
\par always happened to us old anchorites and saints? 
\par 
\par Verily, my folly hath grown big in the mountains! Now do 
\par I hear six old fools legs rattling behind one another! 
\par 
\par But doth Zarathustra need to be frightened by his shadow? 
\par Also, methinketh that after all it hath longer legs than mine." 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra, and, laughing with eyes and en 
\par trails, he stood still and turned round quickly and behold, 
\par he almost thereby threw his shadow and follower to the 
\par ground, so closely had the latter followed at his heels, and so 
\par weak was he. For when Zarathustra scrutinised him with his 
\par glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition, so slender, 
\par swarthy, hollow and worn-out did this follower appear. 
\par 
\par "Who art thou?" asked Zarathustra vehemently, "what doest 
\par thou here? And why callest thou thyself my shadow? Thou art 
\par not pleasing unto me." 
\par 
\par "Forgive me," answered the shadow, "that it is I; and if I 
\par please thee not well, O Zarathustra! therein do I admire thee 
\par and thy good taste. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE SHADOW 305 
\par 
\par A wanderer am I, who have walked long at thy heels; always 
\par on the way, but without a goal, also without a home: so that 
\par verily, I lack little of being the eternally Wandering Jew, 
\par except that I am not eternal and not a Jew, 
\par 
\par What? Must I ever be on the way? Whirled by every wind, 
\par unsettled, driven about? O earth, thou hast become too round 
\par for me! 
\par 
\par On every surface have I already sat, like tired dust have I 
\par fallen asleep on mirrors and window-panes: everything taketh 
\par from me, nothing giveth; I become thin I am almost equal 
\par to a shadow. 
\par 
\par After thee, however, O Zarathustra, did I fly and hie longest; 
\par and though I hid myself from thee, I was nevertheless thy 
\par best shadow: wherever thou hast sat, there sat I also. 
\par 
\par With thee have I wandered about in the remotest, coldest 
\par worlds, like a phantom that voluntarily haunteth winter roofs 
\par and snows. 
\par 
\par With thee have I pushed into all the forbidden, all the worst 
\par and the furthest: and if there be anything of virtue in me, it is 
\par that I have had no fear of any prohibition. 
\par 
\par With thee have I broken up whatever my heart revered; all 
\par boundary-stones and statues have I o erthrown; the most dan 
\par gerous wishes did I pursue, verily, beyond every crime did I 
\par once go. 
\par 
\par With thee did I unlearn the belief in words and worths and 
\par in great names. When the devil casteth his skin, doth not his 
\par name also fall away? It is also skin. The devil himself is 
\par perhaps skin. 
\par 
\par Nothing is true, all is permitted : so said I to myself. Into 
\par the coldest water did I plunge with head and heart. Ah, how 
\par oft did I stand there naked on that account, like a red crab! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 306 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par Ah, where have gone all my goodness and all my shame and 
\par all my belief in the good! Ah, where is the lying innocence 
\par which I once possessed, the innocence of the good and of their 
\par noble lies! 
\par 
\par Too oft, verily, did I follow close to the heels of truth: then 
\par did it kick me on the face. Sometimes I meant to lie, and be 
\par hold! then only did I hit the truth. 
\par 
\par Too much hath become clear unto me: now it doth not con 
\par cern me any more. Nothing liveth any longer that I love, 
\par how should I still love myself? 
\par 
\par To live as I incline, or not to live at all : so do I wish; so 
\par wisheth also the holiest. But alas! how have / still inclina 
\par tion? 
\par 
\par Have / still a goal? A haven towards which my sail is set? 
\par 
\par A good wind? Ah, he only who knoweth whither he saileth, 
\par knoweth what wind is good, and a fair wind for him. 
\par 
\par What still remaineth to me? A heart weary and flippant; 
\par an unstable will; fluttering wings; a broken backbone. 
\par 
\par This seeking for my home: O Zarathustra, dost thou know 
\par that this seeking hath been my home-sickening; it eateth me up. 
\par 
\par Where is my home? For it do I ask and seek, and have 
\par sought, but have not found it. O eternal everywhere, O eternal 
\par nowhere, O eternal in-vain!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake the shadow, and Zarathustra s countenance 
\par lengthened at his words. "Thou art my shadow!" said he at 
\par last sadly. 
\par 
\par "Thy danger is not small, thou free spirit and wanderer! 
\par Thou hast had a bad day: see that a still worse evening doth 
\par not overtake thee! 
\par 
\par To such unsettled ones as thou, seemeth at last even a

\par 
\par NOONTIDE 307 
\par 
\par prisoner blessed. Didst thou ever see how captured criminals 
\par sleep? They sleep quietly, they enjoy their new security. 
\par 
\par Beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee, a hard, 
\par rigorous delusion! For now everything that is narrow and fixed 
\par seduceth and tempteth thee. 
\par 
\par Thou hast lost thy goal. Alas, how wilt thou forego and 
\par forget that loss? Thereby hast thou also lost thy way! 
\par 
\par Thou poor rover and rambler, thou tired butterfly! wilt thou 
\par have a rest and a home this evening? Then go up to my cave! 
\par 
\par Thither leadeth the way to my cave. And now will I run 
\par quickly away from thee again. Already lieth as it were a 
\par shadow upon me. 
\par 
\par I will run alone, so that it may again become bright around 
\par me. Therefore must I still be a long time merrily upon my 
\par legs. In the evening, however, there will be dancing with 
\par me!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par . Noontide 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AND Zarathustra ran and ran, but he found no one else, 
\par and was alone and ever found himself again; he enjoyed and 
\par quaffed his solitude, and thought of good things for hours. 
\par About the hour of noontide, however, when the sun stood 
\par exactly over Zarathustra s head, he passed an old, bent and 
\par gnarled tree, which was encircled round by the ardent love of 
\par a vine, and hidden from itself; from this there hung yellow 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 308 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par grapes in abundance, confronting the wanderer. Then he felt 
\par inclined to quench a little thirst, and to break off for himself a 
\par cluster of grapes. When, however, he had already his arm out 
\par stretched for that purpose, he felt still more inclined for some 
\par thing else namely, to lie down beside the tree at the hour of 
\par perfect noontide and sleep. 
\par 
\par This Zarathustra did; and no sooner had he laid himself on 
\par the ground in the stillness and secrecy of the variegated grass, 
\par than he had forgotten his little thirst, and fell asleep. For as 
\par the proverb of Zarathustra saith: "One thing is more neces 
\par sary than the other." Only that his eyes remained open: for 
\par they never grew weary of viewing and admiring the tree and 
\par the love of the vine. In falling asleep, however, Zarathustra 
\par spake thus to his heart: 
\par 
\par "Hush! Hush! Hath not the world now become perfect? 
\par What hath happened unto me? 
\par 
\par As a delicate wind danceth invisibly upon parqueted seas, 
\par light, feather-light, so danceth sleep upon me. 
\par 
\par No eye doth it close to me, it leaveth my soul awake. Light 
\par is it, verily, feather-light. 
\par 
\par It persuadeth me, I know not how, it toucheth me inwardly 
\par with a caressing hand, it constraineth me. Yea, it constraineth 
\par me, so that my soul stretcheth itself out: - 
\par 
\par How long and weary it becometh, my strange soul! Hath 
\par a seventh-day evening come to it precisely at noontide? Hath 
\par it already wandered too long, blissfully, among good and ripe 
\par things? 
\par 
\par It stretcheth itself out, long longer! it lieth still, my strange 
\par jouL Too many good things hath it already tasted; this golden 
\par sadness oppresseth it, it distorteth its mouth. 
\par 
\par As a ship that putteth into the calmest cove: it now 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par NOONTIDE 309 
\par 
\par draweth up to the land, weary of long voyages and uncertain 
\par seas. Is not the land more faithful 5 
\par 
\par As such a ship huggeth the shore, tuggeth the shore: then 
\par it sufficeth for a spider to spin its thread from the ship to the 
\par land. No stronger ropes are required there. 
\par 
\par As such a weary ship in the calmest cove, so do I also now 
\par repose, nigh to the earth, faithful, trusting, waiting, bound 
\par to it with the lightest threads. 
\par 
\par O happiness! O happiness! Wilt thou perhaps sing, O my 
\par soul? Thou liest in the grass. But this is the secret, solemn hour, 
\par when no shepherd playeth his pipe. 
\par 
\par Take care! Hot noontide sleepeth on the fields. Do not sing! 
\par Hush! The world is perfect. 
\par 
\par Do not sing, thou prairie-bird, my soul! Do not even whis 
\par per! Lo hush! The old noontide sleepeth, it moveth its 
\par mouth: doth it not just now drink a drop of happiness 
\par 
\par An old brown drop of golden happiness, golden wine? 
\par Something whisketh over it, its happiness laugheth. Thus 
\par laugheth a God. Hush! 
\par 
\par For happiness, how little sufficeth for happiness! Thus 
\par spake I once and thought myself wise. But it was a blasphemy: 
\par that have I now learned. Wise fools speak better. 
\par 
\par The least thing precisely, the gentlest thing, the lightest 
\par thing, a lizard s rustling, a breath, a whisk, an eye-glance 
\par little maketh up the best happiness. Hush! 
\par 
\par What hath befallen me: Hark! Hath time flown away? 
\par Do I not fall? Have I not fallen hark! into the well of

\par 
\par What happeneth to me? Hush! It stingeth me alas rj

\par "Up!" said he to himself, "thou sleeper! Thou noontide 
\par sleeper! Well then, up, ye old legs! It is time and more than 
\par time; many a good stretch of road is still awaiting you 
\par 
\par Now have ye slept your fill; for how long a time? A half- 
\par eternity! Well then, up now, mine old heart! For how long 
\par after such a sleep mayest thou remain awake?" 
\par 
\par (But then did he fall asleep anew, and his soul spake against 
\par him and defended itself, and lay down again) "Leave me 
\par alone! Hush! Hath not the world just now become perfect? 
\par Oh, for the golden round ball!"- 
\par 
\par "Get up," said Zarathustra, "thou little thief, thou slug 
\par gard! What! Still stretching thyself, yawning, sighing, falling 
\par into deep wells? 
\par 
\par Who art thou then, O my soul!" ( and here he became fright 
\par ened, for a sunbeam shot down from heaven upon his face. ) 
\par 
\par "O heaven above me," said he sighing, and sat upright, 
\par "thou gazest at me? Thou hearkenest unto my strange soul? 
\par 
\par When wilt thou drink this drop of dew that fell down upon 
\par all earthly things, when wilt thou drink this strange soul 
\par 
\par When, thou well of eternity! thou joyous, awful, noon 
\par tide abyss! when wilt thou drink my soul back into thee?" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra, and rose from his couch beside the 
\par tree, as if awakening from a strange drunkenness: and behold 
\par there stood the sun still exactly above his head. One might, 
\par however, rightly infer therefrom that Zarathustra had not- 
\par then, slept long. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE GREETING 3:1 
\par 
\par 77. The Greeting 
\par 
\par IT WAS fate in the afternoon only when Zarathustra, after long 
\par useless searching and strolling about, again came home to his 
\par cave. When, however, he stood over against it, not more than 
\par twenty paces therefrom, the thing happened which he now 
\par least of all expected: he heard anew the great cry of distress. 
\par And extraordinary! this time the cry came out of his own cave. 
\par It was a long, manifold, peculiar cry, and Zarathustra plainly 
\par distinguished that it was composed of many voices: although 
\par heard at a distance it might sound like the cry out of a single 
\par mouth. 
\par 
\par Thereupon Zarathustra rushed forward to his cave, an 1 
\par behold! what a spectacle awaited him after that concert! For 
\par there did they all sit together whom he had passed during the 
\par day: the king on the right and the king on the left, the old 
\par magician, the pope, the voluntary beggar, the shadow, the in 
\par tellectually conscientious one, the sorrowful soothsayer, and 
\par the ass; the ugliest man, however, had set a crown on his head, 
\par and had put round him two purple girdles, for he liked, like 
\par all ugly ones, to disguise himself and play the handsome per 
\par son. In the midst, however, of that sorrowful company stood 
\par Zarathustra s eagle, ruffled and disquieted, for it had been 
\par called upon to answer too much for which its pride had not any 
\par answer; the wise serpent however hung round its neck. 
\par 
\par All this did Zarathustra behold with great astonishment; 
\par then however he scrutinised each individual guest with cour* 
\par teous curiosity, read their souls and wondered anew. In the 
\par meantime the assembled ones had risen from their seats, and 
\par waited with reverence for Zarathustra to speak. Zarathustra. 
\par however spake thus: 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 3*2 THt*g SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par "Ye despairing ones! Ye strange ones! So it was your cry uf 
\par distress that I heard? And now do I know also where he is to 
\par be sought, whom I have sought for in vain today: the higher 
\par man : 
\par 
\par In mine own cave sitteth he, the higher man 1 But why do 
\par J wonder! Have not I myself allured him to me by honey- 
\par offerings and artful lure-calls of my happiness? 
\par 
\par But it seemeth to me that ye are badly adapted for com 
\par pany: ye make one another s hearts fretful, ye that cry for 
\par help, when ye sit here together? There is one that must first 
\par come, 
\par 
\par One who will make you laugh once more, a good jovial 
\par buffoon, a dancer, a wind, a wild romp, some old fool: 
\par what think ye? 
\par 
\par Forgive me, however, ye despairing ones, for speaking such 
\par trivial words before you, unworthy, verily, of such guests! 
\par But ye do not divine what maketh my heart wanton: 
\par 
\par Ye yourselves do it, and your aspect, forgive it me! For 
\par every one becometh courageous who beholdeth a despairing 
\par one. To encourage a despairing one every one thinketh him 
\par self strong enough to do so. 
\par 
\par To myself have ye given this power, a good gift, mine 
\par honourable guests! An excellent guest s-present! Well, do not 
\par then upbraid when I also offer you something of mine. 
\par 
\par This is mine empire and my dominion: that which is mine, 
\par however, shall this evening and tonight be yours. Mine ani 
\par mals shall serve you : let my cave be your resting-place! 
\par 
\par At house and home with me shall no one despair: in my 
\par purlieus do I protect every one from his wild beasts. And that 
\par is the first thing which I offer you: security! 
\par 
\par The second thing, however, is my little finger. And when ye 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE GREETING 313 
\par 
\par have that, then take the whole hand also, yea and the heart 
\par with it! Welcome here, welcome to you, my guests!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra, and laughed with love and mis 
\par chief. After this greeting his guests bowed once more and were 
\par reverentially silent; the king on the right, however, answered 
\par him in their name. 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra, by the way in which thou hast given us thy 
\par hand and thy greeting, we recognise thee as Zarathustra. Thou 
\par hast humbled thyself before us; almost hast thou hurt our 
\par reverence : 
\par 
\par Who however could have humbled himself as thou hast 
\par done, with such pride? That uplifteth us ourselves; a refresh 
\par ment is it, to our eyes and hearts. 
\par 
\par To behold this, merely, gladly would we ascend higher 
\par mountains than this. For as eager beholders have we come; we 
\par wanted to see what brighteneth dim eyes. 
\par 
\par And lo! now is it all over with our cries of distress. Now 
\par are our minds and hearts open and enraptured. Little is lack 
\par ing for our spirits to become wanton. 
\par 
\par There is nothing, O Zarathustra, that groweth more pleas 
\par ingly on earth than a lofty, strong will : it is the finest growth. 
\par An entire landscape refresheth itself at one such tree. 
\par 
\par To the pine do I compare him, O Zarathustra, which 
\par groweth up like thee tall, silent, hardy, solitary, of the best, 
\par supplest wood, stately, 
\par 
\par In the end, however, grasping out for its dominion with 
\par strong, green branches, asking weighty questions of the wind, 
\par the storm, and whatever is at home on high places; 
\par 
\par Answering more weightily, a commander, a victor! Oh! 
\par who should not ascend high mountains to behold such 
\par growths? 
\par 
\par At thy tree, O Zarathustra, the gloomy and ill-constituted 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par also refresh themselves; at thy look even the wavering becomx 
\par steady and heal their hearts. 
\par 
\par And verily, towards thy mountain and thy tree do many eyes 
\par turn to-day; a great longing hath arisen, and many have learned 
\par to ask: Who is Zarathustra? 
\par 
\par And those into whose ears thou hast at any time dripped 
\par thy song and thy honey: all the hidden ones, the lone-dwellers 
\par and the twain-dwellers, have simultaneously said to their 
\par hearts: 
\par 
\par Doth Zarathustra still live? It is no longer worth while to 
\par live, everything is indifferent, everything is useless: or else 
\par we must live with Zarathustra! 
\par 
\par Why doth he not come who hath so long announced him 
\par self? thus do many people ask; hath solitude swallowed him 
\par up? Or should we perhaps go to him? 
\par 
\par Now doth it come to pass that solitude itself becometh 
\par fragile and breaketh open, like a grave that breaketh open and 
\par can no longer hold its dead. Everywhere one seeth resurrected 
\par ones. 
\par 
\par Now do the waves rise and rise around thy mountain, O 
\par Zarathustra. And however high be thy height, many of them 
\par must rise up to thee: thy boat shall not rest much longer on dry 
\par ground. 
\par 
\par And that we despairing ones have now come into thy cave, 
\par and already no longer despair: it is but a prognostic and a 
\par presage that better ones are on the way to thee, 
\par 
\par For they themselves are on the way to thee, the last 
\par remnant of God among men that is to say, all the men of 
\par great longing, of great loathing, of great satiety, 
\par 
\par All who do not want to live unless they learn again to 
\par hope unless they learn from thee. O Zarathustra, the great 
\par hope!" 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE GREETING 315 
\par 
\par Thus spake the king on the right, and seized the hand of 
\par Zarathustra in order to kiss it; but Zarathustra checked his 
\par veneration, and stepped back frightened, fleeing as it were, 
\par silently and suddenly into the far distance. After a little while, 
\par however, he was again at home with his guests, looked at 
\par them with clear scrutinising eyes, and said: 
\par 
\par "My guests, ye higher men, I will speak plain language and 
\par plainly with you. It is not for you that I have waited here in 
\par these mountains." 
\par 
\par (" Plain language and plainly? Good God!" said here the 
\par king on the left to himself; "one seeth he doth not know the 
\par good Occidentals, this sage out of the Orient! 
\par 
\par But he meaneth blunt language and bluntly well! That 
\par is not the worst taste in these days!" ) 
\par 
\par "Ye may, verily, all of you be higher men," continued Zara 
\par thustra; "but for me ye are neither high enough, nor strong 
\par enough. 
\par 
\par For me, that is to say, for the inexorable wh/ch is now silent 
\par in me, but will not always be silent. And if ye appertain to me, 
\par still it is not as my right arm. 
\par 
\par For he who himself standeth, like you&gt; on sickly and tender 
\par legs, wisheth above all to be treated indulgently, whether he be 
\par conscious of it or hide it from himself. 
\par 
\par My arms and my legs, however, I do not treat indulgently, 
\par / do not treat my warriors indulgently: how then could ye be 
\par iit for m y warfare? 
\par 
\par With you I should spoil all my victories. And many of you 
\par would tumble over if ye but heard the loud beating of my 
\par drums. 
\par 
\par Moreover, ye are not sufficiently beautiful and well-born f o* 
\par me. I require pure, smooth mirrors for my uuctrines; on you* 
\par mine own likenesf is distorted. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 316 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par On your shoulders presseth many a burden, many a recol 
\par lection; many a mischievous dwarf squatteth in your corners* 
\par There is concealed populace also in you. 
\par 
\par And though ye be high and of a higher type, much in you 
\par is crooked and misshapen. There is no smith in the world that 
\par could hammer you right and straight for me. 
\par 
\par Ye are only bridges: may higher ones pass over upon you! 
\par Ye signify steps: so do not upbraid him who ascendeth beyond 
\par you into his height! 
\par 
\par Out of your seed there may one day arise for me a genuine 
\par son and perfect heir: but that time is distant. Ye yourselves 
\par are not those unto whom my heritage and name belong. 
\par 
\par Not for you do I wait here in these mountains; not with you 
\par may 1 descend for the last time. Ye have come unto me only 
\par as a presage that higher ones are on the way to me, 
\par 
\par Not 4 the men of great longing, of great loathing, of great 
\par satiety, and that which ye call the remnant of God; 
\par 
\par Nay! Nay! Three times Nay! For others do I wait here 
\par in these mountains, and will not lift my foot from thence 
\par without them; 
\par 
\par For higher ones, stronger ones, triumphanter ones, 
\par merrier ones, for such as are built squarely in body and soul : 
\par laughing lions must come! 
\par 
\par O my guests, ye strange ones have ye yet heard nothing of 
\par my children? And that they are on the way to me? 
\par 
\par Do speak unto me of my gardens, of my Happy Isles, of my 
\par new beautiful race why do ye not speak unto me thereof? 
\par 
\par This guests -present do I solicit of your love, that ye speaK 
\par unco me of my children. For them am I rich, for them I became 
\par poor: what have I not surrendered. 
\par 
\par What would I not surrender tnat I might have one thing 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE SUPPER 317 
\par 
\par these children, this living plantation, these life-trees of my 
\par will and of my highest hope!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra, and stopped suddenly in his dis 
\par course: for his longing came over him, and he closed his eyes 
\par and his mouth, because of the agitation of his heart. And all 
\par his guests also were silent, and stood still and confounded: 
\par except only that the old soothsayer made signs with his hand* 
\par acd his gestures. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 72. The Supper 
\par 
\par FOR at this point the soothsayer interrupted the greeting of 
\par Zarathustra and his guests : he pressed forward as one who had 
\par no time to lose, seized Zarathustra s hand and exclaimed: "But 
\par Zarathustra! 
\par 
\par One thing is more necessary than the other, so sayest thou 
\par thyself: well, one thing is now more necessary unto me than 
\par all others. 
\par 
\par A word at the right time: didst thou not invite me to table? 
\par And here are many who have made long journeys. Thou dost 
\par not mean to feed us merely with discourses? 
\par 
\par Besides, all of you have thought too much about freezing, 
\par drowning, suffocating, and other bodily dangers : none of you, 
\par however, have thought of my danger, namely, perishing ot 
\par hunger 
\par 
\par (Thus spake the soothsayer. When Zarathustra s animals, 
\par however, heard these words, they ran away in terror. For they 
\par saw that all they had brought home during the day would not 
\par be enough to fill the one soothsayer. ) 
\par 
\par "Likewise perishing of thirst," continued the soothsayer. 
\par "Arid although I hear water splashing here like words of wis- 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 318 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par dom that is to say, plenteously and unweariedly, I wan* 
\par wine! 
\par 
\par Not every one is a born water-drinker like Zarathustra, 
\par Neither d^h water suit weary and withered ones: we deserve 
\par wine // alone giveth immediate vigour and improvised 
\par health!" 
\par 
\par On this occasion, when the soothsayer was longing for wine, 
\par it happened that the king on the left, the silent one, also found 
\par expression for once. "We took care," said he, "about wine, I, 
\par along with my brother the king on the right: we have enough 
\par of wine, a whole ass-load of it. So there is nothing lacking 
\par but bread." 
\par 
\par "Bread." replied Zarathustra, laughing when he spake, "it 
\par is precisely bread that anchorites have not. But man doth not 
\par live by bread alone, but also by the flesh of good lambs, of 
\par which I have two: 
\par 
\par These shall we slaughter quickly, and cook spicily with 
\par sage: it is so that I like them. And there is also no lack of 
\par roots and fruits, good enough even for the fastidious and 
\par dainty, nor of nuts and other riddles for cracking. 
\par 
\par Thus will we have a good repast in a little while. But who 
\par ever wisheth to eat with us must also give a hand to the work, 
\par even the kings. For with Zarathustra even a king may be a 
\par cook." 
\par 
\par This proposal appealed to the hearts of all of them, save 
\par that the voluntary beggar objected to the flesh and wine and 
\par spices. 
\par 
\par "Just hear this glutton Zarathustra!" said he jokingly: "doth 
\par one go into caves and high mountains to make such repasts? 
\par 
\par Now indeed do I understand what he once taught us: 
\par Blessed be moderate poverty! And why he wisheth to dc 
\par away with beggars." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE HIGHER MAN 319 
\par 
\par "Be of good cheer," replied Zarathustra, "as I am. Abide 
\par by thy customs, thou excellent one: grind thy corn, drink thy 
\par water, praise thy cooking, if only it make thee glad! 
\par 
\par I am a law only for mine own; I am not a law for all. He, 
\par however, who belongeth unto me must be strong of bone and 
\par light of foot, 
\par 
\par Joyous in fight and feast, no sulker, no John o Dreams, 
\par ready for the hardest task as for the feast, healthy and hale. 
\par 
\par The best belongeth unto mine and me; and if it be not given 
\par us, then do we take it: the best food, the purest sky, the 
\par strongest thoughts, the fairest women!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra; the king on the right however 
\par answered and said: "Strange! Did one ever hear such sensible 
\par things out of the mouth of a wise man? 
\par 
\par And verily, it is the strangest thing in a wise man, if over 
\par and above, he be still sensible, and not an ass." 
\par 
\par Thus spake the king on the right and wondered; the ass 
\par however, with ill-will, said YE-A to his remark. This however 
\par was the beginning of that long repast which is called "The 
\par Supper" in the history-books. At this there was nothing else 
\par spoken of but the higher man. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par The Higher Man 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par WHEN I came unto men for the first time, then did I commit 
\par the anchorite folly, the great folly: I appeared on the market 
\par place. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 32O THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par And when I spake unto all, I spake unto none. In the eve 
\par ning, however, rope-dancers were my companions, and 
\par corpses; and I myself almost a corpse. 
\par 
\par With the new morning, however, there came unto me a new 
\par Truth: then did I learn to say: "Of what account to me are 
\par market-place and populace and populace-noise and long popu 
\par lace-cars!" 
\par 
\par Ye higher men, learn this from me: On the market-place no 
\par one believeth in higher men. But if ye will speak there, very 
\par well! The populace, however, blinketh: "We are all equal." 
\par 
\par "Ye higher men," so blinketh the populace "there are 
\par no higher men, we are all equal; man is man, before God 
\par we are all equal!" 
\par 
\par Before God! Now, however, this God hath died. Before 
\par the populace, however, we will not be equal. Ye higher men, 
\par away from the market-place! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 2 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Before God! Now however this God hath died! Ye higher 
\par men, this God was your greatest danger. 
\par 
\par Only since he lay in the grave have ye again arisen. Now 
\par only cometh the great noontide, now only doth the higher 
\par man become master! 
\par 
\par Have ye understood this word, O my brethren? Ye are 
\par frightened: do your hearts turn giddy? Doth the abyss here 
\par yawn for you? Doth the hell-hound here yelp at you? 
\par 
\par Well! Take heart! ye higher men! Now only travaileth the

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par The most careful ask to-day: "How is man to be main 
\par tained?" Zarathustra however asketh, as the first and only one: 
\par "How is man to be surpassed?" 
\par 
\par The Superman, I have at heart; that is the first and only thing 
\par to me and not man: not the neighbour, not the poorest, not 
\par the sorriest, not the best. 
\par 
\par O my brethren, what I can love in man is that he is an over 
\par going and a down-going. And also in you there is much that 
\par maketh me love and hope. 
\par 
\par In that ye have despised, ye higher men, that maketh me 
\par hope. For the great despisers are the great reverers. 
\par 
\par In that ye have despaired, there is much to honour. For ye 
\par have not learned to submit yourselves, ye have not learned 
\par petty policy. 
\par 
\par For to-day have the petty people become master: they all 
\par preach submission and humility and policy and diligence and 
\par consideration and the long et cetera of petty virtues. 
\par 
\par Whatever is of the effeminate type, whatever originateth 
\par from the servile type, and especially the populace-mishmash:

\par 
\par That asketh and asketh and never tireth: "How is man to

\par are they the masters of today. 
\par 
\par These masters of today surpass them, O my brethren

\par the courage before witnesses, but anchorite and eagle courage, 
\par which not even a God any longer beholdeth? 
\par 
\par Cold souls, mules, the blind and the drunken, I do not call

\par He who seeth the abyss, but with eagle s eyes, he who with 
\par eagle s talons grasp eth the abyss: he hath courage.

\par 
\par "O pure odours around me," cried he, "O blessed stillness 
\par around me! But where are mine animals? Hither, hither, mine

\par 
\par Tell me, mine animals : these higher men, all of them do 
\par they perhaps not smell well? O pure odours around me! Now 
\par only do I know and feel how I love you, mine animals." 
\par 
\par And Zarathustra said once more: "I love you, mine ani 
\par mals!" The eagle, however, and the serpent pressed close to 
\par him when he spake these words, and looked up to him. In this

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par Hardly, however, had Zarathustra left the cave when the 
\par old magician got up, looked cunningly about him, and said: 
\par "He is gone! 
\par 
\par And already, ye higher men let me tickle you with this

\par 
\par For fear that is man s original and fundamental feeling; 
\par through fear everything is explained, original sin and original 
\par virtue. Through fear there grew also my virtue, that is to say: 
\par Science. 
\par 
\par For fear of wild animals that hath been longest fostered

\par 
\par Such prolonged ancient fear, at last become subtle, spir 
\par itual and intellectual at present, me thinketh, it is called 
\par Science." 
\par 
\par Thus spake the conscientious one; but Zarathustra, who had 
\par just come back into his cave and had heard and divined the last 
\par discourse, threw a handful of roses to the conscientious one, 
\par and laughed on account of his "truths." "Why!" he exclaimed, 
\par "what did I hear just now? Verily, it seemeth to me, thou art a 
\par fool, or else I myself am one: and quietly and quickly will I 
\par put thy truth upside down. 
\par 
\par For fear is an exception with us. Courage, however, and 
\par adventure, and delight in the uncertain, in the unattempted 
\par courage seemeth to me the entire primitive history of man. 
\par 
\par The wildest and most courageous animals hath he envied 
\par and robbed of all their virtues : thus only did he become man. 
\par 
\par This courage, at last become subtle, spiritual and intellec 
\par tual, this human courage, with eagle s pinions and serpent s 
\par wisdom : this, it seemeth to me, is called at present 
\par 
\par ( Zarathustra!" cried all of them there assembled, as if with 
\par one voice, and burst out at the same time into a great laugh 
\par ter; there arose, however, from them as it were a heavy cloud. 
\par Even the magician laughed, and said wisely: "Well! It is gone, 
\par mine evil spirit! 
\par 
\par And did I not myself warn you against it when I said that 
\par it was a deceiver, a lying and deceiving spirit? 
\par 
\par Especially when it showeth itself naked. But what can / do 
\par with regard to its tricks! Have / created it and the world? 
\par 
\par Well! Let us be good again, and of good cheer! And al 
\par though Zarathustra looketh with evil eye just see him! he 
\par disliketh me : 
\par 
\par Ere night cometh will he again learn to love and laud me; 
\par he cannot live long without committing such follies. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AMONG DAUGHTERS OF THE DESERT 341 
\par 
\par He loveth his enemies: this art knoweth he better than any 
\par one I have seen. But he taketh revenge for it on his friends!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake the old magician, and the higher men applauded 
\par him; so that Zarathustra went round, and mischievously and 
\par lovingly shook hands with his friends, like one who hath to 
\par make amends and apologise to every one for something. When 
\par however he had thereby come to the door of his cave, lo, then 
\par had he again a longing for the good air outside, and for his 
\par animals, and wished to steal out.

\par "Go NOT away!" said then the wanderer who called himself

\par gloomy affliction might again fall upon us. 
\par 
\par Now hath that old magician given us of his worst for oui 
\par gcod, and lo! the good, pious pope there hath tears in his eyes, 
\par and hath quite embarked again upon the sea of melancholy. 
\par 
\par Those kings may well put on a good air before us still : for 
\par that have they learned best of us all at present! Had they how* 
\par ever no one to see them, I wager that with them also the bad 
\par game would again commence, 
\par 
\par The bad game of drifting clouds, of damp melancholy,

\par Thou hast nourished us with strong food for men, and 
\par powerful proverbs: do not let the weakly, womanly spirits 
\par attack us anew at dessert! 
\par 
\par Thou alone makest the air around thee strong and clear. Did 
\par 1 ever find anywhere on earth such good air as with thee in thy 
\par cave? 
\par 
\par Many lands have I seen, my nose hath learned to test and 
\par estimate many kinds of air: but with thee do my nostrils taste 
\par their greatest delight! 
\par 
\par Unless it be, unless it be , do forgive an old recollection! 
\par Forgive me an old after-dinner song, which I once composed 
\par amongst daughters of the desert: 
\par 
\par For with them was there equally good, clear, Oriental air: 
\par there was I furthest from cloudy, damp, melancholy Old- 
\par Europe! 
\par 
\par Then did I love such Oriental maidens and other blue king 
\par doms of heaven, over which hang no clouds and no thoughts. 
\par 
\par Ye would not believe how charmingly they sat there, when, 
\par they did not dance, profound, but without thoughts, like little 
\par secrets, like beribboned riddles, like dessert-nuts 
\par 
\par Many-hued and foreign, forsooth! but without clouds: rid 
\par dles which can be guessed: to please such maidens I then 
\par composed an after-dinner psalm." 
\par 
\par Thus spake the wanderer who called himself Zarathustra s 
\par shadow; and before any one answered him, he had seized the 
\par harp of the old magician, crossed his legs, and looked calmly 
\par and sagely around him: with his nostrils, however, he in 
\par haled the air slowly and questioningly, like one who in new 
\par countries tasteth new foreign air. Afterward he began to sing 
\par with a kind of roaring.

\par 348 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par . The Awakening 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AFTER the song of the wanderer and shadow, the cave became 
\par all at once full of noise and laughter: and since the assembled 
\par guests all spake simultaneously, and even the ass, encouraged 
\par thereby, no longer remained silent, a little aversion and scorn 
\par for his visitors came over Zarathustra, although he rejoiced at 
\par their gladness. For it seemed to him a sign of convalescence. 
\par So he slipped out into the open air and spake to his animals. 
\par 
\par "Whither hath their distress now gone?" said he, and 
\par already did he himself feel relieved of his petty disgust 
\par "with me, it seemeth that they have unlearned their cries of 
\par distress! 
\par 
\par Though, alas! not yet their crying." And Zarathustra 
\par stopped his ears, for just then did the YE-A of the ass mix 
\par strangely with the noisy jubilation of those higher men. 
\par 
\par "They are merry," he began again, "and who knoweth? 
\par perhaps at their host s expense; and if they have learned of me 
\par to laugh, still it is not my laughter they have learned. 
\par 
\par But what matter about that! They are old people: they re 
\par cover in their own way, they laugh in their own way; mine ears 
\par have already endured worse and have not become peevish. 
\par 
\par This day is a victory: he already yieldeth, he fleeth, the spirit 
\par of gravity, mine old arch-enemy! How well this day is about te 
\par end, which began so badly and gloomily! 
\par 
\par And it is about to end. Already cometh the evening: over 
\par the sea rideth it hither, the good rider! How it bobbeth, the 
\par blessed one, the home- returning one, in its purple saddles! 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE AWAKENING 349 
\par 
\par The sky gazeth brightly thereon, the world lieth deep. Oh r 
\par all ye strange ones who have come to me, it is already worth 
\par a/hile to have lived with me!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. And again came the cries anc* 
\par laughter of the higher men out of the cave: then began he 
\par anew: 
\par 
\par They bite at it, my bait taketh, there departeth also from 
\par them their enemy, the spirit of gravity. Now do they learn to 
\par laugh at themselves: do I hear rightly? 
\par 
\par My virile food taketh effect, my strong and savoury sayings : 
\par and verily, I did not nourish them with flatulent vegetables! 
\par But with warrior-food, with conqueror-food : new desires did 
\par I awaken. 
\par 
\par New hopes are in their arms and legs, their hearts expand. 
\par They find new words, soon will their spirits breathe wanton 
\par ness. 
\par 
\par Such food may sure enough not be proper for children, nor 
\par even for longing girls old and young. One persuadeth their 
\par bowels otherwise; I am not their physician and teacher. 
\par 
\par The disgust departeth from these higher men; well! that is 
\par my victory. In my domain they become assured; all stupid 
\par shame fleeth away; they empty themselves. 
\par 
\par They empty their hearts, good times return unto them, they 
\par keep holiday and ruminate, they become thankful. 
\par 
\par That do I take as the best sign: they become thankful. Not 
\par long will it be ere they devise festivals, and put up memorials 
\par to their old joys. 
\par 
\par They are convalescents!" Thus spake Zarathustra joyfullv 
\par to his heart and gazed outward; his animals, however, pressed 
\par up to him, and honoured his happiness and his silence.

\par for the cave which had hitherto been full of noise and laugh 
\par ter, became all at once still as death; his nose, however, smel 
\par a sweet-scented vapour and incense-odour, as if from burning 
\par pine-cones. 
\par 
\par "What happeneth? What are they about?" he asked himself, 
\par And stole nrr tc the entrance, that he might be able unobserved 
\par to see his guests. But wonder upon wonder! what was he then 
\par obliged to behold with his own eyes! 
\par 
\par "They have all of them become pious again, they pray, they 
\par are mad!" said he, and was astonished beyond measure. And 
\par forsooth! all these higher men, the two kings, the pope out of 
\par service, the evil magician, the voluntary beggar, the wanderer 
\par and shadow, the old soothsayer, the spiritually conscientious 
\par one, and the ugliest man they all lay on their knees like chil 
\par dren and credulous old women, and worshipped the ass. And 
\par just then began the ugliest man to gurgle and snort, as if some 
\par thing unutterable in him tried to find expression; when, how 
\par ever, he had actually found words, behold! it was a pious 
\par strange litany in praise of the adored and censed ass. And the 
\par litany sounded thus: 
\par 
\par Amen! And glory and honour and wisdom and thanks anc* 
\par praise and strength be to our God, from everlasting to ever

\par 
\par Lo! how thou spurnest none from thee, neither beggars nor

\par *iT THIS place in the litany, however, Zarathustra could nc 
\par longer control himself; he himself cried out YE-A, louder even 
\par than the ass, and sprang into the midst of his maddened guests. 
\par "Whatever are you about, ye grown-up children? he ex 
\par claimed, pulling up the praying ones from the ground. "Alas, 
\par if any one else, except Zarathustra, had seen you : 
\par 
\par Every one would think you the worst blasphemers, or the 
\par very foolishest old women, with your new belief! 
\par 
\par And thou thyself, thou old pope, how is it in accordance 
\par with thee, to adore an ass in such a manner as God?" 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra," answered the pope, "forgive me, but in 
\par divine matters I am more enlightened even than thou. And it 
\par is right that it should be so. 
\par 
\par Better to adore God so, in this form, than in no form at all.! 
\par Think over this saying, mine exalted friend: thou wilt readily 
\par divine that in such a saying there is wisdom. 
\par 
\par He who said God is a Spirit made the greatest stride and 
\par slide hitherto made on earth towards unbelief: such a dictum 
\par is not easily amended again on earth!

\par Mine old heart leapeth and boundeth because there is still 
\par something to adore on earth. Forgive it, O Zarathustra, to an 
\par old, pious pontiff-heart! 
\par

\par "thou art right: but how can I help it! The old God liveth 
\par again, O Zarathustra, thou mayst say what thou wilt. 
\par 
\par The ugliest man is to blame for it all : he hath reawakened 
\par him. And if he say that he once killed him, with Gods death 
\par is always just a prejudice." 
\par 
\par -"And thou," said Zarathustra, "thou bad old magician, 
\par what didst thou do! Who ought to believe any longer in thee 
\par in this free age, when thou believest in such divine donkeyism? 
\par 
\par It was a stupid thing that chou didst; how couldst thou, a 
\par shrewd man, do such a stupid thing!" 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra," answered the shrewd magician, "thou art 
\par right, it was a stupid thing, it was also repugnant to me." 
\par 
\par "And thou even," said Zarathustra to the spiritually con 
\par scientious one, "consider, and put thy finger to thy nose! Doth 
\par nothing go against thy conscience here? Is thy spirit not too 
\par cleanly for this praying and the fumes of those devotees?" 
\par 
\par "There is something therein," said the spiritually conscien 
\par tious one, and put his finger to his nose, "there is something in 
\par this spectacle which even doeth good to my conscience. 
\par

\par paths? The evidence teacheth it, O Zarathustra, thine own

\par 
\par -"And thou thyself, finally/ said Zarathustra, and turned 
\par towards the ugliest man, who still lay on the ground stretch 
\par ing up his arm to the ass (for he gave it wine to drink) . "Say, 
\par thou nondescript, what hast thou been about! 
\par 
\par Thou seemest to me transformed, thine eyes glow, the man- 
\par de of the sublime covereth thine ugliness: what didst thou do? 
\par 
\par Is it then true what they say, that thou hast again awakened 
\par him? And why? Was he not tor good reasons killed and made

\par 
\par Thou thyself seemest to me awakened: what didst thou do? 
\par why didst thou turn round? Why didst thou get converted? 
\par Speak, thou nondescript!" 
\par 
\par "O Zarathustra," answered the ugliest man, "thou art a 
\par rogue! 
\par 
\par Whether he yet liveth, or again liveth, or is thoroughly dead 
\par which of us both knoweth that best? I ask thee. 
\par 
\par One thing however do I know, from thyself did I learn it

\par

\par thou once, O Zarathustra, thou hidden one, thou destroyer

\par 
\par of his cave, and turning towards all his guests, cried out with 
\par a strong voice: 
\par 
\par "O ye wags, all of you, ye buffoons! Why do ye dissemble 
\par and disguise yourselves before me! 
\par 
\par How the hearts of all of you convulsed with delight and 
\par wickedness, because ye had at last become again like little 
\par children namely, pious, 
\par 
\par Because ye at last did again as children do namely, 
\par prayed, folded your hands and said good God ! 
\par 
\par But now leave, I pray you, this nursery, mine own cave, 
\par where today all childishness is carried on. Cool down, here 
\par outside, your hot child- wantonness and heart-tumult! 
\par 
\par To be sure: except ye become as little children ye shall not 
\par enter into that kingdom of heaven." (And Zarathustra pointed 
\par aloft with his hands.) 
\par 
\par "But we do not at all want to enter into the kingdom of 
\par heaven: we have become men, so we want the kingdom of 
\par earth." 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par And once more began Zarathustra to speak. "O my new 
\par friends," said he, "ye strange ones, ye higher men, how well 
\par do ye now please me, 
\par 
\par Since ye have again become joyful! Ye have, verily, all 
\par blossomed forth : it seemeth to me that for such flowers as you,

\par 
\par And should ye celebrate it again, this ass-festival, do it from 
\par love to yourselves, do it also from love to me! And in remem 
\par brance of me!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par The Drunken Song 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par MEANWHILE one after another had gone out into the open air, 
\par and into the cool, thoughtful night; Zarathustra himself, how 
\par ever, led the ugliest man by the hand, that he might show him 
\par his night-world, and the great round moon, and the silvery 
\par water-falls near his cave. There they at last stood still beside 
\par one another; all of them old people, but with comforted, brave 
\par hearts, and astonished in themselves that it was so well with 
\par them on earth; the mystery of the night, however, came nighcr 
\par and nigher to their hearts. And anew Zarathustra thought to 
\par himself: "Oh, how well do they now please me, these higher 
\par men!" but he did not say it aloud, for he respected their 
\par happiness and their silence. 
\par 
\par Then, however, there happened that which in this astonish 
\par ing long day was most astonishing: the ugliest man began once 
\par more and for the last time to gurgle and snort, and when he 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE DRUNKEN SONG 357 
\par 
\par at length found expression, behold! there sprang a ques 
\par tion plump and plain out of his mouth, a good, deep, clear 
\par question, which moved the hearts of all who listened to him. 
\par 
\par "My friends, all of you," said the ugliest man, "what thinK 
\par ye? For the sake of this day / am for the first time content to 
\par have lived mine entire life. 
\par 
\par And that I testify so much is still not enough for me. It 
\par is worth while living on the earth : one day, one festival with 
\par Zarathustra, hath taught me to love the earth. 
\par 
\par Was that life? will I say unto death. Well! Once 
\par more! 
\par 
\par My friends, what think ye? Will ye not, like me, say unto 
\par death: Was that life? For the sake of Zarathustra, well! 
\par Once more! " 
\par 
\par Thus spake the ugliest man; it was not, however, far from 
\par midnight. And what took place then, think ye? As soon as the 
\par higher men heard his question, they became all at once con 
\par scious of their transformation and convalescence, and of him 
\par who was the cause thereof : then did they rush up to Zarathus 
\par tra, thanking, honouring, caressing him, and kissing his hands, 
\par each in his own peculiar way; so that some laughed and some 
\par wept. The old soothsayer, however, danced with delight; and. 
\par though he was then, as some narrators suppose, full of sweet 
\par wine, he was certainly still fuller of sweet life, and had re 
\par nounced all weariness. There are even those who narrate that 
\par the ass then danced: for not in vain had the ugliest man previ 
\par ously given it wine to drink. That may be the case, or it may be 
\par otherwise; and if in truth the ass did not dance that evening, 
\par there nevertheless happened then greater and rarer wonders 
\par than the dancing of an ass would have been. In short, as the 
\par proverb of Zarathustra saith: "What doth it matter!" 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par 358 THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par When, however, this took place with the ugliest man, Zara 
\par diusura stood there like one drunken: his glance dulled, his 
\par tongue faltered and his feet staggered. And who could divine 
\par what thoughts then passed through Zarathustra s soul? Ap 
\par parently, however, his spirit retreated and fled in advance and 
\par was in remote distances, and as it were "wandering on high 
\par mountain-ridges," as it standeth written, " twixt two seas, 
\par 
\par Wandering twixt the past and the future as a heavy 
\par cloud." Gradually, however, while the higher men held him 
\par in their arms, he came back to himself a little, and resisted 
\par with his hands the crowd of the honouring and caring ones; 
\par but he did not speak. All at once, however, he turned his head 
\par quickly, for he seemed to hear something: then laid he his 
\par finger on his mouth and said: "Come!" 
\par 
\par And immediately it became still and mysterious round 
\par about; from the depth however there came up slowly the sound 
\par of a clock-bell. Zarathustra listened thereto, like the higher 
\par men; then, however, laid he his ringer on his mouth the second 
\par time, and said again: "Come! Come! It is getting on to mid 
\par night!" and his voice had changed. But still he had not 
\par moved from the spot. Then it became yet stiller and more mys 
\par terious, and everything hearkened, even the ass, and Zarathus 
\par tra s noble r.njmals, the eagle and the serpent, likewise the 
\par cave of Zarathustra an d the big cool moon, and the night itself. 
\par Zarathustra, however, laid his hand upon his mouth for the 
\par third time, and said: 
\par 
\par Come! Come! Come! Let us now wander! It is the now, 
\par let us wander into the night!

\par came out of his cave glowing and strong, like a morning sun 
\par coming out of gloomy mountains. 
\par 
\par "Thou great star," spake he, as he had spoken once before, 
\par "thou deep eye of happiness, what would be all thy happiness 
\par if thou hadst not those for whom thou shinest! 
\par 
\par And if they remained in their chambers whilst thou art 
\par already awake, and comest and bestowest and distributest, how

\par 
\par Well! they still sleep, these higher men, whilst/ am awake: 
\par they are not my proper companions! Not for them do I wait 
\par here in my mountains. 
\par 
\par my work I want to be, at my day: but they understand

\par 
\par not what are the signs of my morning, my step is not fo&gt; 
\par them the awakening-call. 
\par 
\par They still sleep in my cave; their dream still drinketh at my 
\par drunken songs. The audient ear for me the obedient ear, is 
\par yet lacking in their limbs." 
\par 
\par This had Zarathustra spoken to his heart when the sun 
\par arose: then looked he inquiringly aloft, for he heard above 
\par him the sharp call of his eagle. "Well!" called he upwards, 
\par "thus is it pleasing and proper to me. Mine animals are awake, 
\par for 1 am awake. 
\par 
\par Mine eagle is awake, and like me honoureth the sun. With 
\par eagle-talons doth it grasp at the new light. Ye are my proper 
\par animals; I love you. 
\par 
\par But still do I lack my proper men!"- 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra; then, however, it happened that all 
\par on a sudden he became aware that he was flocked around and 
\par fluttered around, as if by innumerable birds, the whizzing of 
\par so many wings, however, and the crowding around his head 
\par was so great that he shut his eyes. And verily, there came down 
\par upon him as it were a cloud, like a cloud of arrows which 
\par poureth upon a new enemy. But behold, here it was a cloud of 
\par love, and showered upon a new friend. 
\par 
\par "What happeneth unto me?" thought Zarathustra in his 
\par Astonished heart, and slowly seated himself on the big stone 
\par which lay close to the exit from his cave. But while he grasped 
\par about with his hands, around him, above him and below him, 
\par and repelled the tender birds, behold, there then happened to 
\par him something still stranger: for he grasped thereby unawares 
\par into a mass of thick, warm, shaggy hair; at the same time, how 
\par ever, there sounded before him a roar, a long, soft lion-roar. 
\par 
\par "The sign cometh" said Zarathustra, and a change came 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par THE SIGN 367 
\par 
\par over nis heart. And in truth, when it turned clear before him, 
\par there lay a yellow, powerful animal at his feet, resting its head 
\par on his knee, unwilling to leave him out of love, and doing 
\par like a dog which again findeth its old master. The doves, how 
\par ever, were no less eager with their love than the lion; and 
\par whenever a dove whisked over its nose, the lion shook its head 
\par and wondered and laughed. 
\par 
\par When all this went on Zarathustra spake only a word: ff Aly 
\par children are nigh, my children" , then he became quite mute 
\par His heart, however, was loosed, and from his eyes there 
\par dropped down tears and fell upon his hands. And he took no 
\par further notice of anything, but sat there motionless, without 
\par repelling the animals further. Then flew the doves to and fro, 
\par and perched on his shoulder, and caressed his white hair, and 
\par did not tire of their tenderness and joyousness. The strong lion, 
\par however, licked always the tears that fell on Zarathustra s 
\par hands, and roared and growled shyly. Thus did these animals 
\par do.- 
\par 
\par All this went on for a long time, or a short time : for properly 
\par speaking, there is no time on earth for such things . Mean 
\par while, however, the higher men had awakened in Zarathustra s 
\par cave, and marshalled themselves for a procession to go to meet 
\par Zarathustra, and give him their morning greeting: for they had 
\par found when they awakened that he no longer tarried with 
\par them. When, however, they reached the door of the cave and 
\par the noise of their steps had preceded them, the hon started 
\par violently; it turned away all at once from Zarathustra, and 
\par roaring wildly, sprang towards the cave. The higher men, 
\par however, when they heard the lion roaring, cried all aloud as 
\par with one voice, fled back and vanished in an instant. 
\par 
\par Zarathustra himself, however, stunned and strange, ros*

\par at a glance all that had taken place between yesterday and to 
\par day. "Here is indeed the stone," said he, and stroked his beard, 
\par "on // sat I yester-morn; and here came the soothsayer unto me. 
\par and here heard I first the cry which I heard just now, the great 
\par cry of distress. 
\par 
\par O ye higher men, your distress was it that tne old soothsayer 
\par foretold to me yester-morn, 
\par 
\par Unto your distress did he want to seduce and tempt me: 
\par O Zarathustra, said he to me, I come to seduce thee to thy 
\par last sin/ 
\par 
\par To my last sin?" cried Zarathustra, and laughed angrily at 
\par his own words: "what hath been reserved for me as my last 
\par sin?" 
\par 
\par And once more Zarathustra became absorbed in himself, 
\par and sat down again on the big stone and meditated. Suddenly 
\par he sprang up, 
\par 
\par "Fellow-suffering! Fellow-suffering with the higher men!" 
\par he cried out, arid his countenance changed into brass. "Well. 1 
\par That hath had its time! 
\par 
\par My suffering and my fellow-suffering what matter about 
\par them! Do I then strive after happiness? I strive after my work! 
\par 
\par Well! The lion hath come, my children are nigh, Zarathustra 
\par hath grown ripe, mine hour hath come: 
\par 
\par This is my morning, my day beginneth: arise now, arise, 
\par thou great noontide!" 
\par 
\par Thus spake Zarathustra and left his cave, glowing and 
\par strong, like a morning sun coming out of gloomy mountains. }{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2\insrsid14315394\charrsid351531
