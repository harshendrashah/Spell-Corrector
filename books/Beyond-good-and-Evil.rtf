\par laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is
\par already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is
\par it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn
\par impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions
\par ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really
\par is this "Will to Truth" in us? In fact we made a long halt at the
\par question as to the origin of this Will--until at last we came to an
\par absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired
\par about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT
\par RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the
\par value of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presented
\par ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which
\par the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of
\par interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as
\par if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first
\par to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk
\par in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.
\par 
\par 2. "HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth
\par out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the
\par generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the
\par wise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams
\par of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest
\par value must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR own--in this
\par transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of
\par delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in
\par the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the
\par 'Thing-in-itself--THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!"--This
\par mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which
\par metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation
\par is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this "belief" of
\par theirs, they exert themselves for their "knowledge," for something that
\par is in the end solemnly christened "the Truth." The fundamental belief of
\par metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurred
\par even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where
\par doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn
\par vow, "DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM." For it may be doubted, firstly, whether
\par antitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations
\par and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their
\par seal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional
\par perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from
\par below--"frog perspectives," as it were, to borrow an expression current
\par among painters. In spite of all the value which may belong to the true,
\par the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher
\par and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to
\par pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It
\par might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and
\par respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously
\par related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed
\par things--perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps!
\par But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous "Perhapses"!
\par For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of
\par philosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the
\par reverse of those hitherto prevalent--philosophers of the dangerous
\par "Perhaps" in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I
\par see such new philosophers beginning to appear.
\par 
\par 3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between
\par their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of
\par conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and
\par it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to
\par learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and "innateness." As
\par little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process
\par and procedure of heredity, just as little is "being-conscious" OPPOSED
\par to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the
\par conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his
\par instincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and
\par its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak
\par more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite
\par mode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the
\par uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than "truth" such valuations,
\par in spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be
\par only superficial valuations, special kinds of _niaiserie_, such as may
\par be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposing,
\par in effect, that man is not just the "measure of things."
\par 
\par 4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is
\par here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The
\par question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving,
\par species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally
\par inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic
\par judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that
\par without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of
\par reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable,
\par without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers,
\par man could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions would be
\par a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A
\par CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of
\par value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so,
\par has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.
\par 
\par 5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully
\par and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they
\par are--how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in
\par short, how childish and childlike they are,--but that there is not
\par enough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and
\par virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in
\par the remotest manner. They all pose as though their real opinions had
\par been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure,
\par divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics,
\par who, fairer and foolisher, talk of "inspiration"), whereas, in fact, a
\par prejudiced proposition, idea, or "suggestion," which is generally
\par their heart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with
\par arguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not
\par wish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their
\par prejudices, which they dub "truths,"--and VERY far from having the
\par conscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having
\par the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be
\par understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence
\par and self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally
\par stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic
\par by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his "categorical
\par imperative"--makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small
\par amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical
\par preachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by
\par means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and
\par mask--in fact, the "love of HIS wisdom," to translate the term fairly
\par and squarely--in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart
\par of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible
\par maiden, that Pallas Athene:--how much of personal timidity and
\par vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!
\par 
\par 6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up
\par till now has consisted of--namely, the confession of its originator, and
\par a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover
\par that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted
\par the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown.
\par Indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a
\par philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first
\par ask oneself: "What morality do they (or does he) aim at?" Accordingly,
\par I do not believe that an "impulse to knowledge" is the father of
\par philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made
\par use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever
\par considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining
\par how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and
\par cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time
\par or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to
\par look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate
\par LORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as
\par SUCH, attempts to philosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in
\par the case of really scientific men, it may be otherwise--"better," if
\par you will; there there may really be such a thing as an "impulse to
\par knowledge," some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well
\par wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of
\par the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. The actual
\par "interests" of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another
\par direction--in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics;
\par it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little
\par machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a
\par good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not
\par CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the
\par contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all,
\par his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE
\par IS,--that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature
\par stand to each other.
\par 
\par 7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging
\par than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the
\par Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense,
\par and on the face of it, the word signifies "Flatterers of
\par Dionysius"--consequently, tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles;
\par besides this, however, it is as much as to say, "They are all ACTORS,
\par there is nothing genuine about them" (for Dionysiokolax was a popular
\par name for an actor). And the latter is really the malignant reproach that
\par Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the
\par mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters--of
\par which Epicurus was not a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos,
\par who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three
\par hundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who
\par knows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god
\par Epicurus really was. Did she ever find out?
\par 
\par 8. There is a point in every philosophy at which the "conviction" of
\par the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an
\par ancient mystery:
\par 
\par Adventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.
\par 
\par 9. You desire to LIVE "according to Nature"? Oh, you noble Stoics, what
\par fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly
\par extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration,
\par without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain:
\par imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power--how COULD you live
\par in accordance with such indifference? To live--is not that just
\par endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing,
\par preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different?
\par And granted that your imperative, "living according to Nature," means
\par actually the same as "living according to life"--how could you do
\par DIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves
\par are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you:
\par while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature,
\par you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players
\par and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and
\par ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein;
\par you insist that it shall be Nature "according to the Stoa," and would
\par like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal
\par glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth,
\par you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such
\par hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically,
\par that you are no longer able to see it otherwise--and to crown all, some
\par unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that
\par BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves--Stoicism is
\par self-tyranny--Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is
\par not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting
\par story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today,
\par as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always
\par creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy
\par is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the
\par will to "creation of the world," the will to the causa prima.
\par 
\par 10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with
\par which the problem of "the real and the apparent world" is dealt with at
\par present throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and
\par he who hears only a "Will to Truth" in the background, and nothing else,
\par cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. In rare and isolated
\par cases, it may really have happened that such a Will to Truth--a certain
\par extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the
\par forlorn hope--has participated therein: that which in the end always
\par prefers a handful of "certainty" to a whole cartload of beautiful
\par possibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience,
\par who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an
\par uncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing,
\par mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a
\par virtue may display. It seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger
\par and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. In that they side
\par AGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of "perspective," in
\par that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the
\par credibility of the ocular evidence that "the earth stands still," and
\par thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession
\par to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than
\par in one's body?),--who knows if they are not really trying to win back
\par something which was formerly an even securer possession, something
\par of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the "immortal
\par soul," perhaps "the old God," in short, ideas by which they could live
\par better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by
\par "modern ideas"? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode
\par of looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed
\par yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety
\par and scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the
\par most varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on
\par the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair
\par motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom
\par there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness. Therein it
\par seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and
\par knowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels
\par them from MODERN reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde
\par by-paths concern us! The main thing about them is NOT that they wish
\par to go "back," but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MORE
\par strength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFF--and
\par not back!
\par 
\par 11. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to
\par divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on
\par German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which
\par he set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of
\par Categories; with it in his hand he said: "This is the most difficult
\par thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics." Let us
\par only understand this "could be"! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a
\par new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting
\par that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid
\par flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and
\par on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible
\par something--at all events "new faculties"--of which to be still
\par prouder!--But let us reflect for a moment--it is high time to do so.
\par "How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE?" Kant asks himself--and
\par what is really his answer? "BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)"--but
\par unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly,
\par and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes, that
\par one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved
\par in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this
\par new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further
\par discovered a moral faculty in man--for at that time Germans were still
\par moral, not yet dabbling in the "Politics of hard fact." Then came
\par the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of the
\par Tubingen institution went immediately into the groves--all seeking for
\par "faculties." And what did they not find--in that innocent, rich, and
\par still youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the
\par malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish
\par between "finding" and "inventing"! Above all a faculty for the
\par "transcendental"; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition,
\par and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally
\par pious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of
\par this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness,
\par notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile
\par conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral
\par indignation. Enough, however--the world grew older, and the dream
\par vanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still
\par rub them today. People had been dreaming, and first and foremost--old
\par Kant. "By means of a means (faculty)"--he had said, or at least meant to
\par say. But, is that--an answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely
\par a repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? "By means of
\par a means (faculty)," namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in
\par Moliere,
\par 
\par     Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,
\par     Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.
\par 
\par But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time
\par to replace the Kantian question, "How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI
\par possible?" by another question, "Why is belief in such judgments
\par necessary?"--in effect, it is high time that we should understand
\par that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the
\par preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might
\par naturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and
\par readily--synthetic judgments a priori should not "be possible" at all;
\par we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false
\par judgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as
\par plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view
\par of life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which
\par "German philosophy"--I hope you understand its right to inverted commas
\par (goosefeet)?--has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is
\par no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to
\par German philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous,
\par the mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the
\par political obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still
\par overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into
\par this, in short--"sensus assoupire."...
\par 
\par 12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted
\par theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps
\par no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious
\par signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an
\par abbreviation of the means of expression)--thanks chiefly to the Pole
\par Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest
\par and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus
\par has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth
\par does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the
\par last thing that "stood fast" of the earth--the belief in "substance," in
\par "matter," in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest
\par triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One
\par must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war
\par to the knife, against the "atomistic requirements" which still lead a
\par dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more
\par celebrated "metaphysical requirements": one must also above all give
\par the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which
\par Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it be
\par permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the
\par soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad,
\par as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between
\par ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of "the soul" thereby,
\par and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses--as
\par happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly
\par touch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open
\par for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such
\par conceptions as "mortal soul," and "soul of subjective multiplicity,"
\par and "soul as social structure of the instincts and passions," want
\par henceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In that the NEW
\par psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have
\par hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of
\par the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert
\par and a new distrust--it is possible that the older psychologists had a
\par merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds
\par that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT--and, who knows?
\par perhaps to DISCOVER the new.
\par 
\par 13. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the
\par instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic
\par being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength--life
\par itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirect
\par and most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short, here, as everywhere else,
\par let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!--one of which
\par is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's
\par inconsistency). It is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must
\par be essentially economy of principles.
\par 
\par 14. It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural
\par philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according
\par to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as
\par it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a
\par long time to come must be regarded as more--namely, as an explanation.
\par It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and
\par palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and
\par CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes--in fact, it
\par follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.
\par What is clear, what is "explained"? Only that which can be seen and
\par felt--one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the
\par charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode,
\par consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence--perhaps
\par among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our
\par contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining
\par masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional
\par networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses--the
\par mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and
\par interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT
\par different from that which the physicists of today offer us--and likewise
\par the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers,
\par with their principle of the "smallest possible effort," and the greatest
\par possible blunder. "Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there
\par is also nothing more for men to do"--that is certainly an imperative
\par different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right
\par imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders
\par of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.
\par 
\par 15. To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on
\par the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the
\par idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!
\par Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as
\par heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the external world
\par is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external
\par world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves
\par would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a
\par complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something
\par fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is NOT the work
\par of our organs--?
\par 
\par 16. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are
\par "immediate certainties"; for instance, "I think," or as the superstition
\par of Schopenhauer puts it, "I will"; as though cognition here got hold
\par of its object purely and simply as "the thing in itself," without any
\par falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the
\par object. I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that "immediate
\par certainty," as well as "absolute knowledge" and the "thing in itself,"
\par involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves
\par from the misleading significance of words! The people on their part may
\par think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher
\par must say to himself: "When I analyze the process that is expressed in
\par the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the
\par argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible:
\par for instance, that it is _I_ who think, that there must necessarily be
\par something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the
\par part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,'
\par and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by
\par thinking--that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided
\par within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether
\par that which is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'? In
\par short, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the
\par present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to
\par determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with
\par further 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for
\par me."--In place of the "immediate certainty" in which the people may
\par believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of
\par metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions
\par of the intellect, to wit: "Whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'?
\par Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak
\par of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego'
\par as cause of thought?" He who ventures to answer these metaphysical
\par questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like
\par the person who says, "I think, and know that this, at least, is
\par true, actual, and certain"--will encounter a smile and two notes of
\par interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. "Sir," the philosopher will
\par perhaps give him to understand, "it is improbable that you are not
\par mistaken, but why should it be the truth?"
\par 
\par 17. With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire
\par of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by
\par these credulous minds--namely, that a thought comes when "it" wishes,
\par and not when "I" wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the
\par case to say that the subject "I" is the condition of the predicate
\par "think." ONE thinks; but that this "one" is precisely the famous old
\par "ego," is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and
\par assuredly not an "immediate certainty." After all, one has even gone too
\par far with this "one thinks"--even the "one" contains an INTERPRETATION of
\par the process, and does not belong to the process itself. One infers here
\par according to the usual grammatical formula--"To think is an activity;
\par every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently"... It
\par was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides
\par the operating "power," the material particle wherein it resides and out
\par of which it operates--the atom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at
\par last to get along without this "earth-residuum," and perhaps some day we
\par shall accustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of view, to
\par get along without the little "one" (to which the worthy old "ego" has
\par refined itself).
\par 
\par 18. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is
\par refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle
\par minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the "free will"
\par owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing
\par who feels himself strong enough to refute it.
\par 
\par 19. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were
\par the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us
\par to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and
\par completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and
\par again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what
\par philosophers are in the habit of doing--he seems to have adopted a
\par POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be above
\par all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in name--and
\par it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got
\par the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages.
\par So let us for once be more cautious, let us be "unphilosophical": let
\par us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations,
\par namely, the sensation of the condition "AWAY FROM WHICH we go," the
\par sensation of the condition "TOWARDS WHICH we go," the sensation of this
\par "FROM" and "TOWARDS" itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular
\par sensation, which, even without our putting in motion "arms and legs,"
\par commences its action by force of habit, directly we "will" anything.
\par Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are
\par to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place,
\par thinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is
\par a ruling thought;--and let us not imagine it possible to sever this
\par thought from the "willing," as if the will would then remain over!
\par In the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and
\par thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the
\par command. That which is termed "freedom of the will" is essentially the
\par emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: "I am free, 'he'
\par must obey"--this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally
\par so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself
\par exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that "this and
\par nothing else is necessary now," the inward certainty that obedience
\par will be rendered--and whatever else pertains to the position of the
\par commander. A man who WILLS commands something within himself which
\par renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. But now let
\par us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,--this affair so
\par extremely complex, for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch as
\par in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND
\par the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of
\par constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually
\par commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other
\par hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive
\par ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term "I": a whole series
\par of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the
\par will itself, has become attached to the act of willing--to such a degree
\par that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action.
\par Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will
\par when the effect of the command--consequently obedience, and therefore
\par action--was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into
\par the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who
\par wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are
\par somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing,
\par to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation
\par of power which accompanies all success. "Freedom of Will"--that is the
\par expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising
\par volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with
\par the executor of the order--who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over
\par obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will
\par that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the
\par feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful
\par "underwills" or under-souls--indeed, our body is but a social structure
\par composed of many souls--to his feelings of delight as commander. L'EFFET
\par C'EST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed
\par and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies
\par itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it is
\par absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as
\par already said, of a social structure composed of many "souls", on which
\par account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such
\par within the sphere of morals--regarded as the doctrine of the relations
\par of supremacy under which the phenomenon of "life" manifests itself.
\par 
\par 20. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or
\par autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with
\par each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear
\par in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to
\par a system as the collective members of the fauna of a Continent--is
\par betrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most
\par diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme
\par of POSSIBLE philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve
\par once more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they
\par may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something
\par within them leads them, something impels them in definite order the
\par one after the other--to wit, the innate methodology and relationship
\par of their ideas. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a
\par re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off,
\par ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly
\par grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order.
\par The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German
\par philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where there is
\par affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammar--I mean
\par owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical
\par functions--it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset
\par for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems,
\par just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of
\par world-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within the
\par domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject
\par is least developed) look otherwise "into the world," and will be
\par found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and
\par Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately
\par also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.--So
\par much by way of rejecting Locke's superficiality with regard to the
\par origin of ideas.
\par 
\par 21. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been
\par conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the
\par extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and
\par frightfully with this very folly. The desire for "freedom of will"
\par in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway,
\par unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear
\par the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and
\par to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom,
\par involves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with
\par more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the
\par hair, out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in
\par this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of "free
\par will" and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry
\par his "enlightenment" a step further, and also put out of his head the
\par contrary of this monstrous conception of "free will": I mean "non-free
\par will," which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. One
\par should not wrongly MATERIALISE "cause" and "effect," as the natural
\par philosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at
\par present), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes
\par the cause press and push until it "effects" its end; one should use
\par "cause" and "effect" only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as
\par conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual
\par understanding,--NOT for explanation. In "being-in-itself" there is
\par nothing of "casual-connection," of "necessity," or of "psychological
\par non-freedom"; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there "law"
\par does not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence,
\par reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive,
\par and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world,
\par as "being-in-itself," with things, we act once more as we have always
\par acted--MYTHOLOGICALLY. The "non-free will" is mythology; in real life
\par it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.--It is almost always
\par a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every
\par "causal-connection" and "psychological necessity," manifests something
\par of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom;
\par it is suspicious to have such feelings--the person betrays himself. And
\par in general, if I have observed correctly, the "non-freedom of the will"
\par is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but
\par always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their
\par "responsibility," their belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to
\par THEIR merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others
\par on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed
\par for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF
\par THE BUSINESS, no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are
\par in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of
\par socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a matter of
\par fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly
\par when it can pose as "la religion de la souffrance humaine"; that is ITS
\par "good taste."
\par 
\par 22. Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist from
\par the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation, but
\par "Nature's conformity to law," of which you physicists talk so proudly,
\par as though--why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad
\par "philology." It is no matter of fact, no "text," but rather just a
\par naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which
\par you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern
\par soul! "Everywhere equality before the law--Nature is not different in
\par that respect, nor better than we": a fine instance of secret motive,
\par in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and
\par autocratic--likewise a second and more refined atheism--is once more
\par disguised. "Ni dieu, ni maitre"--that, also, is what you want; and
\par therefore "Cheers for natural law!"--is it not so? But, as has been
\par said, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along,
\par who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read
\par out of the same "Nature," and with regard to the same phenomena, just
\par the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims
\par of power--an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and
\par unconditionalness of all "Will to Power" before your eyes, that almost
\par every word, and the word "tyranny" itself, would eventually seem
\par unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphor--as being too
\par human; and who should, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about
\par this world as you do, namely, that it has a "necessary" and "calculable"
\par course, NOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are
\par absolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate consequences
\par every moment. Granted that this also is only interpretation--and you
\par will be eager enough to make this objection?--well, so much the better.
\par 
\par 23. All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and
\par timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so far
\par as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written,
\par evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if
\par nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology
\par and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it.
\par The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most
\par intellectual world, the world apparently most indifferent and
\par unprejudiced, and has obviously operated in an injurious, obstructive,
\par blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has to
\par contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator,
\par it has "the heart" against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal
\par conditionalness of the "good" and the "bad" impulses, causes (as
\par refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and manly
\par conscience--still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good
\par impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person should regard even
\par the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and imperiousness
\par as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present,
\par fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which
\par must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further
\par developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from
\par sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest
\par and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous
\par knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one
\par should keep away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand, if one has
\par once drifted hither with one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our
\par teeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm!
\par We sail away right OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the
\par remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither--but
\par what do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal
\par itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who
\par thus "makes a sacrifice"--it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto,
\par on the contrary!--will at least be entitled to demand in return that
\par psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences,
\par for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. For psychology
\par is once more the path to the fundamental problems.
\par

\par 
\par CHAPTER II. THE FREE SPIRIT
\par 
\par 
\par 24. O sancta simplicitiatas! In what strange simplification and
\par falsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once one has
\par got eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made everything around
\par us clear and free and easy and simple! how we have been able to give
\par our senses a passport to everything superficial, our thoughts a godlike
\par desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences!--how from the beginning,
\par we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost
\par inconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence, heartiness,
\par and gaiety--in order to enjoy life! And only on this solidified,
\par granite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself
\par hitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful
\par will, the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as
\par its opposite, but--as its refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed, that
\par LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and that
\par it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees
\par and many refinements of gradation; it is equally to be hoped that the
\par incarnated Tartuffery of morals, which now belongs to our unconquerable
\par "flesh and blood," will turn the words round in the mouths of us
\par discerning ones. Here and there we understand it, and laugh at the way
\par in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this
\par SIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and suitably
\par falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or not, it loves
\par error, because, as living itself, it loves life!
\par 
\par 25. After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain be
\par heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye philosophers
\par and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering "for the
\par truth's sake"! even in your own defense! It spoils all the innocence
\par and fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong against
\par objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when
\par in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even
\par worse consequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card
\par as protectors of truth upon earth--as though "the Truth" were such an
\par innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of
\par all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, Messrs Loafers and
\par Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye know sufficiently well that
\par it cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point; ye know
\par that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that there might
\par be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark
\par which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and
\par occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and
\par trumping games before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out of the way!
\par Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may
\par be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat feared! And pray, don't forget
\par the garden, the garden with golden trellis-work! And have people around
\par you who are as a garden--or as music on the waters at eventide, when
\par already the day becomes a memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free,
\par wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to
\par remain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad,
\par does every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means
\par of force! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one, a long watching
\par of enemies, of possible enemies! These pariahs of society, these
\par long-pursued, badly-persecuted ones--also the compulsory recluses, the
\par Spinozas or Giordano Brunos--always become in the end, even under the
\par most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps without being themselves aware
\par of it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-Brewers (just lay bare
\par the foundation of Spinoza's ethics and theology!), not to speak of
\par the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a
\par philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. The
\par martyrdom of the philosopher, his "sacrifice for the sake of truth,"
\par forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him;
\par and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity,
\par with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous
\par desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a
\par "martyr," into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). Only, that it is necessary
\par with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any
\par case--merely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the
\par continued proof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that
\par every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.
\par 
\par 26. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy,
\par where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority--where he may
\par forget "men who are the rule," as their exception;--exclusive only of
\par the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger
\par instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. Whoever, in
\par intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green
\par and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy,
\par gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;
\par supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden
\par and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains,
\par as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then
\par certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as
\par such, he would one day have to say to himself: "The devil take my good
\par taste! but 'the rule' is more interesting than the exception--than
\par myself, the exception!" And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would
\par go "inside." The long and serious study of the AVERAGE man--and
\par consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad
\par intercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one's
\par equals):--that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every
\par philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing
\par part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge
\par should be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and
\par lighten his task; I mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize
\par the animal, the commonplace and "the rule" in themselves, and at the
\par same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them
\par talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES--sometimes they
\par wallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the only
\par form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the
\par higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and
\par congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before
\par him, or the scientific satyr speaks out. There are even cases where
\par enchantment mixes with the disgust--namely, where by a freak of nature,
\par genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the
\par case of the Abbe Galiani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also
\par filthiest man of his century--he was far profounder than Voltaire, and
\par consequently also, a good deal more silent. It happens more frequently,
\par as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an ape's body, a
\par fine exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means
\par rare, especially among doctors and moral physiologists. And whenever
\par anyone speaks without bitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man
\par as a belly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one
\par sees, seeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity
\par as the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any one
\par speaks "badly"--and not even "ill"--of man, then ought the lover of
\par knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought, in general,
\par to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. For the
\par indignant man, and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with
\par his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, God, or society),
\par may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and
\par self-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more ordinary,
\par more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one is such a LIAR
\par as the indignant man.
\par 
\par 27. It is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks and
\par lives gangasrotogati [Footnote: Like the river Ganges: presto.] among
\par those only who think and live otherwise--namely, kurmagati [Footnote:
\par Like the tortoise: lento.], or at best "froglike," mandeikagati
\par [Footnote: Like the frog: staccato.] (I do everything to be "difficultly
\par understood" myself!)--and one should be heartily grateful for the
\par good will to some refinement of interpretation. As regards "the good
\par friends," however, who are always too easy-going, and think that as
\par friends they have a right to ease, one does well at the very first to
\par grant them a play-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding--one can
\par thus laugh still; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends--and
\par laugh then also!
\par 
\par 28. What is most difficult to render from one language into another
\par is the TEMPO of its style, which has its basis in the character of the
\par race, or to speak more physiologically, in the average TEMPO of the
\par assimilation of its nutriment. There are honestly meant translations,
\par which, as involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the
\par original, merely because its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and
\par obviates all dangers in word and expression) could not also be
\par rendered. A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language;
\par consequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the most
\par delightful and daring NUANCES of free, free-spirited thought. And just
\par as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience,
\par so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything
\par ponderous, viscous, and pompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying
\par species of style, are developed in profuse variety among Germans--pardon
\par me for stating the fact that even Goethe's prose, in its mixture of
\par stiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the "good
\par old time" to which it belongs, and as an expression of German taste at a
\par time when there was still a "German taste," which was a rococo-taste
\par in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic
\par nature, which understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was
\par not the translator of Bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in
\par the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the
\par Roman comedy-writers--Lessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO,
\par and flight out of Germany. But how could the German language, even
\par in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli, who in his
\par "Principe" makes us breathe the dry, fine air of Florence, and cannot
\par help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo,
\par perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he
\par ventures to present--long, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and
\par a TEMPO of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour? Finally, who
\par would venture on a German translation of Petronius, who, more than any
\par great musician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in invention, ideas, and
\par words? What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil world,
\par or of the "ancient world," when like him, one has the feet of a wind,
\par the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which makes
\par everything healthy, by making everything RUN! And with regard to
\par Aristophanes--that transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose
\par sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed, provided one has
\par understood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and
\par transfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on
\par PLATO'S secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit
\par fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no
\par "Bible," nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic--but a book of
\par Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life--a Greek life which
\par he repudiated--without an Aristophanes!
\par 
\par 29. It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a
\par privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best
\par right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably
\par not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a
\par labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself
\par already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see
\par how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal
\par by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it
\par is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor
\par sympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go
\par back again to the sympathy of men!
\par 
\par 30. Our deepest insights must--and should--appear as follies, and under
\par certain circumstances as crimes, when they come unauthorizedly to
\par the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. The
\par exoteric and the esoteric, as they were formerly distinguished by
\par philosophers--among the Indians, as among the Greeks, Persians, and
\par Mussulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of rank and
\par NOT in equality and equal rights--are not so much in contradistinction
\par to one another in respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and
\par viewing, estimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not
\par from the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in
\par question views things from below upwards--while the esoteric class views
\par things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the soul from which
\par tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all the
\par woe in the world were taken together, who would dare to decide whether
\par the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy, and
\par thus to a doubling of the woe?... That which serves the higher class of
\par men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely
\par different and lower order of human beings. The virtues of the common
\par man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be
\par possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and go
\par to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he
\par would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he
\par had sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for the soul and
\par the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the
\par higher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case they are
\par dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they are
\par herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery. Books for the
\par general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry people
\par clings to them. Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they
\par reverence, it is accustomed to stink. One should not go into churches if
\par one wishes to breathe PURE air.
\par 
\par 31. In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art
\par of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do
\par hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay.
\par Everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, THE TASTE FOR
\par THE UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns
\par to introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try
\par conclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. The
\par angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no
\par peace, until it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able
\par to vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even, is something
\par falsifying and deceptive. Later on, when the young soul, tortured by
\par continual disillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itself--still
\par ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how
\par it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges
\par itself for its long self-blinding, as though it had been a voluntary
\par blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's
\par sentiments; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the
\par good conscience to be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and
\par lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses
\par upon principle the cause AGAINST "youth."--A decade later, and one
\par comprehends that all this was also still--youth!
\par 
\par 32. Throughout the longest period of human history--one calls it the
\par prehistoric period--the value or non-value of an action was inferred
\par from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into
\par consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China at
\par present, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to
\par its parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what
\par induced men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period
\par the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, "Know thyself!" was
\par then still unknown.--In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand,
\par on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far,
\par that one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin,
\par decide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an
\par important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect
\par of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in "origin,"
\par the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as
\par the MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby
\par made. Instead of the consequences, the origin--what an inversion
\par of perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected only after long
\par struggle and wavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a
\par peculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely
\par thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite
\par sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in the
\par belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention.
\par The intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action:
\par under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been
\par bestowed, and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the
\par present day.--Is it not possible, however, that the necessity may now
\par have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing
\par and fundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness
\par and acuteness in man--is it not possible that we may be standing on
\par the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished
\par negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists,
\par the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely
\par in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all
\par that is seen, sensible, or "sensed" in it, belongs to its surface or
\par skin--which, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still
\par more? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom,
\par which first requires an explanation--a sign, moreover, which has too
\par many interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself
\par alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood
\par hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a
\par prematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank
\par as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be
\par surmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the
\par self-mounting of morality--let that be the name for the long-secret
\par labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright,
\par and also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones
\par of the soul.
\par 
\par 33. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for
\par one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be mercilessly
\par called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics
\par of "disinterested contemplation," under which the emasculation of art
\par nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.
\par There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments "for others"
\par and "NOT for myself," for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here,
\par and for one asking promptly: "Are they not perhaps--DECEPTIONS?"--That
\par they PLEASE--him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also
\par the mere spectator--that is still no argument in their FAVOUR, but just
\par calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!
\par 
\par 34. At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays,
\par seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we
\par think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light
\par upon: we find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into
\par surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the "nature of things."
\par He, however, who makes thinking itself, and consequently "the spirit,"
\par responsible for the falseness of the world--an honourable exit, which
\par every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of--he
\par who regards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as
\par falsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to become
\par distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon
\par us the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee would it give that
\par it would not continue to do what it has always been doing? In all
\par seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and
\par respect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon
\par consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answers:
\par for example, whether it be "real" or not, and why it keeps the outer
\par world so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same
\par description. The belief in "immediate certainties" is a MORAL NAIVETE
\par which does honour to us philosophers; but--we have now to cease being
\par "MERELY moral" men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly which
\par does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-ready distrust
\par is regarded as the sign of a "bad character," and consequently as an
\par imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-class world and its Yeas
\par and Nays, what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: the
\par philosopher has at length a RIGHT to "bad character," as the being who
\par has hitherto been most befooled on earth--he is now under OBLIGATION
\par to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of
\par suspicion.--Forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of
\par expression; for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate
\par differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep at
\par least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which
\par philosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is nothing
\par more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it
\par is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must be
\par conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis
\par of perspective estimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous
\par enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers, one wished to do away
\par altogether with the "seeming world"--well, granted that YOU could do
\par that,--at least nothing of your "truth" would thereby remain! Indeed,
\par what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an
\par essential opposition of "true" and "false"? Is it not enough to suppose
\par degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and
\par tones of semblance--different valeurs, as the painters say? Why might
\par not the world WHICH CONCERNS US--be a fiction? And to any one who
\par suggested: "But to a fiction belongs an originator?"--might it not be
\par bluntly replied: WHY? May not this "belong" also belong to the fiction?
\par Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the
\par subject, just as towards the predicate and object? Might not the
\par philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar? All respect
\par to governesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce
\par governess-faith?
\par 
\par 35. O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish in
\par "the truth," and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about it
\par too humanely--"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien"--I wager he
\par finds nothing!
\par 
\par 36. Supposing that nothing else is "given" as real but our world of
\par desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other "reality"
\par but just that of our impulses--for thinking is only a relation of these
\par impulses to one another:--are we not permitted to make the attempt and
\par to ask the question whether this which is "given" does not SUFFICE, by
\par means of our counterparts, for the understanding even of the so-called
\par mechanical (or "material") world? I do not mean as an illusion, a
\par "semblance," a "representation" (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian
\par sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions
\par themselves--as a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in
\par which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which afterwards
\par branches off and develops itself in organic processes (naturally also,
\par refines and debilitates)--as a kind of instinctive life in which all
\par organic functions, including self-regulation, assimilation, nutrition,
\par secretion, and change of matter, are still synthetically united with
\par one another--as a PRIMARY FORM of life?--In the end, it is not only
\par permitted to make this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of
\par LOGICAL METHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as
\par the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its
\par furthest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so): that is
\par a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays--it follows
\par "from its definition," as mathematicians say. The question is ultimately
\par whether we really recognize the will as OPERATING, whether we believe in
\par the causality of the will; if we do so--and fundamentally our belief IN
\par THIS is just our belief in causality itself--we MUST make the attempt
\par to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.
\par "Will" can naturally only operate on "will"--and not on "matter" (not
\par on "nerves," for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be
\par hazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever "effects"
\par are recognized--and whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power
\par operates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will.
\par Granted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive
\par life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of
\par will--namely, the Will to Power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all
\par organic functions could be traced back to this Will to Power, and that
\par the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition--it is one
\par problem--could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the
\par right to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER. The
\par world seen from within, the world defined and designated according to
\par its "intelligible character"--it would simply be "Will to Power," and
\par nothing else.
\par 
\par 37. "What? Does not that mean in popular language: God is disproved, but
\par not the devil?"--On the contrary! On the contrary, my friends! And who
\par the devil also compels you to speak popularly!
\par 
\par 38. As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with
\par the French Revolution (that terrible farce, quite superfluous when
\par judged close at hand, into which, however, the noble and visionary
\par spectators of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own
\par indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately, UNTIL THE TEXT HAS
\par DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION), so a noble posterity might once
\par more misunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby make
\par ITS aspect endurable.--Or rather, has not this already happened? Have
\par not we ourselves been--that "noble posterity"? And, in so far as we now
\par comprehend this, is it not--thereby already past?
\par 
\par 39. Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because
\par it makes people happy or virtuous--excepting, perhaps, the amiable
\par "Idealists," who are enthusiastic about the good, true, and beautiful,
\par and let all kinds of motley, coarse, and good-natured desirabilities
\par swim about promiscuously in their pond. Happiness and virtue are no
\par arguments. It is willingly forgotten, however, even on the part of
\par thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as
\par little counter-arguments. A thing could be TRUE, although it were in
\par the highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental
\par constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full
\par knowledge of it--so that the strength of a mind might be measured by
\par the amount of "truth" it could endure--or to speak more plainly, by the
\par extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped,
\par and falsified. But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain
\par PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably
\par situated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the
\par wicked who are happy--a species about whom moralists are silent. Perhaps
\par severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of
\par strong, independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle, refined,
\par yielding good-nature, and habit of taking things easily, which are
\par prized, and rightly prized in a learned man. Presupposing always,
\par to begin with, that the term "philosopher" be not confined to the
\par philosopher who writes books, or even introduces HIS philosophy into
\par books!--Stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the
\par free-spirited philosopher, which for the sake of German taste I will
\par not omit to underline--for it is OPPOSED to German taste. "Pour etre
\par bon philosophe," says this last great psychologist, "il faut etre sec,
\par clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du
\par caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, c'est-a-dire
\par pour voir clair dans ce qui est."
\par 
\par 40. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things
\par have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the CONTRARY only
\par be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in? A question
\par worth asking!--it would be strange if some mystic has not already
\par ventured on the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such a
\par delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness
\par and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of an
\par extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take
\par a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his
\par recollection. Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in
\par order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret:
\par shame is inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is
\par most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask--there is so much
\par goodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something costly and
\par fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like
\par an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shame
\par requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in his shame meets his
\par destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach,
\par and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate
\par friends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their
\par eyes, and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature,
\par which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is
\par inexhaustible in evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a
\par mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his
\par friends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some day be
\par opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there--and
\par that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; nay, more,
\par around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask, owing to
\par the constantly false, that is to say, SUPERFICIAL interpretation
\par of every word he utters, every step he takes, every sign of life he
\par manifests.
\par 
\par 41. One must subject oneself to one's own tests that one is destined
\par for independence and command, and do so at the right time. One must not
\par avoid one's tests, although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous
\par game one can play, and are in the end tests made only before ourselves
\par and before no other judge. Not to cleave to any person, be it even the
\par dearest--every person is a prison and also a recess. Not to cleave to
\par a fatherland, be it even the most suffering and necessitous--it is even
\par less difficult to detach one's heart from a victorious fatherland. Not
\par to cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose peculiar
\par torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. Not to cleave
\par to a science, though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries,
\par apparently specially reserved for us. Not to cleave to one's own
\par liberation, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird, which
\par always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it--the
\par danger of the flier. Not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become as
\par a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our "hospitality" for
\par instance, which is the danger of dangers for highly developed
\par and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently with
\par themselves, and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes
\par a vice. One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELF--the best test of
\par independence.
\par 
\par 42. A new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture to baptize
\par them by a name not without danger. As far as I understand them, as far
\par as they allow themselves to be understood--for it is their nature to
\par WISH to remain something of a puzzle--these philosophers of the
\par future might rightly, perhaps also wrongly, claim to be designated as
\par "tempters." This name itself is after all only an attempt, or, if it be
\par preferred, a temptation.
\par 
\par 43. Will they be new friends of "truth," these coming philosophers? Very
\par probably, for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. But
\par assuredly they will not be dogmatists. It must be contrary to their
\par pride, and also contrary to their taste, that their truth should still
\par be truth for every one--that which has hitherto been the secret wish
\par and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. "My opinion is MY opinion:
\par another person has not easily a right to it"--such a philosopher of the
\par future will say, perhaps. One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to
\par agree with many people. "Good" is no longer good when one's neighbour
\par takes it into his mouth. And how could there be a "common good"! The
\par expression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always of
\par small value. In the end things must be as they are and have always
\par been--the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the
\par profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up
\par shortly, everything rare for the rare.
\par 
\par 
\par 44. Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free, VERY
\par free spirits, these philosophers of the future--as certainly also they
\par will not be merely free spirits, but something more, higher, greater,
\par and fundamentally different, which does not wish to be misunderstood and
\par mistaken? But while I say this, I feel under OBLIGATION almost as much
\par to them as to ourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and
\par forerunners), to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old
\par prejudice and misunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the
\par conception of "free spirit" obscure. In every country of Europe, and the
\par same in America, there is at present something which makes an abuse of
\par this name a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of spirits,
\par who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts
\par prompt--not to mention that in respect to the NEW philosophers who are
\par appearing, they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors.
\par Briefly and regrettably, they belong to the LEVELLERS, these wrongly
\par named "free spirits"--as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of
\par the democratic taste and its "modern ideas" all of them men without
\par solitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom
\par neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only, they
\par are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in their
\par innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and
\par failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed--a notion
\par which happily inverts the truth entirely! What they would fain attain
\par with all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow happiness of the
\par herd, together with security, safety, comfort, and alleviation of life
\par for every one, their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines
\par are called "Equality of Rights" and "Sympathy with All Sufferers"--and
\par suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be
\par DONE AWAY WITH. We opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and
\par conscience to the question how and where the plant "man" has hitherto
\par grown most vigorously, believe that this has always taken place under
\par the opposite conditions, that for this end the dangerousness of his
\par situation had to be increased enormously, his inventive faculty and
\par dissembling power (his "spirit") had to develop into subtlety and daring
\par under long oppression and compulsion, and his Will to Life had to be
\par increased to the unconditioned Will to Power--we believe that severity,
\par violence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy,
\par stoicism, tempter's art and devilry of every kind,--that everything
\par wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and serpentine in man, serves
\par as well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite--we do
\par not even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH, and in any case we
\par find ourselves here, both with our speech and our silence, at the OTHER
\par extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability, as their
\par antipodes perhaps? What wonder that we "free spirits" are not exactly
\par the most communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in every
\par respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE perhaps it will
\par then be driven? And as to the import of the dangerous formula, "Beyond
\par Good and Evil," with which we at least avoid confusion, we ARE something
\par else than "libres-penseurs," "liben pensatori" "free-thinkers,"
\par and whatever these honest advocates of "modern ideas" like to call
\par themselves. Having been at home, or at least guests, in many realms of
\par the spirit, having escaped again and again from the gloomy, agreeable
\par nooks in which preferences and prejudices, youth, origin, the accident
\par of men and books, or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us,
\par full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed
\par in honours, money, positions, or exaltation of the senses, grateful even
\par for distress and the vicissitudes of illness, because they always free
\par us from some rule, and its "prejudice," grateful to the God, devil,
\par sheep, and worm in us, inquisitive to a fault, investigators to the
\par point of cruelty, with unhesitating fingers for the intangible, with
\par teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible, ready for any business
\par that requires sagacity and acute senses, ready for every adventure,
\par owing to an excess of "free will", with anterior and posterior souls,
\par into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to pry, with
\par foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot may run, hidden
\par ones under the mantles of light, appropriators, although we resemble
\par heirs and spendthrifts, arrangers and collectors from morning till
\par night, misers of our wealth and our full-crammed drawers, economical
\par in learning and forgetting, inventive in scheming, sometimes proud of
\par tables of categories, sometimes pedants, sometimes night-owls of
\par work even in full day, yea, if necessary, even scarecrows--and it is
\par necessary nowadays, that is to say, inasmuch as we are the born, sworn,
\par jealous friends of SOLITUDE, of our own profoundest midnight and midday
\par solitude--such kind of men are we, we free spirits! And perhaps ye are
\par also something of the same kind, ye coming ones? ye NEW philosophers?
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER III. THE RELIGIOUS MOOD
\par 
\par 
\par 45. The human soul and its limits, the range of man's inner experiences
\par hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances of these
\par experiences, the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME,
\par and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordained
\par hunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a "big hunt". But
\par how often must he say despairingly to himself: "A single individual!
\par alas, only a single individual! and this great forest, this virgin
\par forest!" So he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants,
\par and fine trained hounds, that he could send into the history of the
\par human soul, to drive HIS game together. In vain: again and again he
\par experiences, profoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find
\par assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his
\par curiosity. The evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous
\par hunting-domains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense
\par are required, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the "BIG
\par hunt," and also the great danger commences,--it is precisely then that
\par they lose their keen eye and nose. In order, for instance, to divine and
\par determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE
\par has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi, a person would
\par perhaps himself have to possess as profound, as bruised, as immense an
\par experience as the intellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he would
\par still require that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality,
\par which, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and effectively
\par formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences.--But who
\par could do me this service! And who would have time to wait for such
\par servants!--they evidently appear too rarely, they are so improbable at
\par all times! Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know
\par something; which means that one has MUCH to do!--But a curiosity like
\par mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices--pardon me! I mean to
\par say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven, and already upon
\par earth.
\par 
\par 46. Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not infrequently
\par achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited world,
\par which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind
\par it and in it, counting besides the education in tolerance which
\par the Imperium Romanum gave--this faith is NOT that sincere, austere
\par slave-faith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell, or some other
\par northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and
\par Christianity, it is much rather the faith of Pascal, which resembles in
\par a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason--a tough, long-lived,
\par worm-like reason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single
\par blow. The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice
\par of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at
\par the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation. There is
\par cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith, which is adapted to a
\par tender, many-sided, and very fastidious conscience, it takes for granted
\par that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL, that all the
\par past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in
\par the form of which "faith" comes to it. Modern men, with their obtuseness
\par as regards all Christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense for the
\par terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by
\par the paradox of the formula, "God on the Cross". Hitherto there had never
\par and nowhere been such boldness in inversion, nor anything at once so
\par dreadful, questioning, and questionable as this formula: it promised a
\par transvaluation of all ancient values--It was the Orient, the PROFOUND
\par Orient, it was the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and its
\par noble, light-minded toleration, on the Roman "Catholicism" of non-faith,
\par and it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith, the
\par half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith,
\par which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against
\par them. "Enlightenment" causes revolt, for the slave desires the
\par unconditioned, he understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in morals,
\par he loves as he hates, without NUANCE, to the very depths, to the point
\par of pain, to the point of sickness--his many HIDDEN sufferings make
\par him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering. The
\par skepticism with regard to suffering, fundamentally only an attitude of
\par aristocratic morality, was not the least of the causes, also, of the
\par last great slave-insurrection which began with the French Revolution.
\par 
\par 47. Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far,
\par we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen:
\par solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinence--but without its being possible
\par to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect, or IF
\par any relation at all of cause and effect exists there. This latter doubt
\par is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among
\par savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and
\par excessive sensuality, which then with equal suddenness transforms into
\par penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both
\par symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it
\par MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there
\par grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to
\par have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers--perhaps it
\par is time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or,
\par better still, to look AWAY, TO GO AWAY--Yet in the background of the
\par most recent philosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the
\par problem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious
\par crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how is the
\par saint possible?--that seems to have been the very question with which
\par Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. And thus it was a
\par genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adherent
\par (perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is concerned), namely, Richard
\par Wagner, should bring his own life-work to an end just here, and should
\par finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as Kundry,
\par type vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the
\par mad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to study
\par the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis--or as I call
\par it, "the religious mood"--made its latest epidemical outbreak and
\par display as the "Salvation Army"--If it be a question, however, as to
\par what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages,
\par and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, it
\par is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein--namely, the
\par immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, of states of the soul regarded as
\par morally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident that
\par a "bad man" was all at once turned into a "saint," a good man. The
\par hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not
\par possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed
\par itself under the dominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions
\par of moral values, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions
\par into the text and facts of the case? What? "Miracle" only an error of
\par interpretation? A lack of philology?
\par 
\par 48. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to their
\par Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally, and
\par that consequently unbelief in Catholic countries means something quite
\par different from what it does among Protestants--namely, a sort of revolt
\par against the spirit of the race, while with us it is rather a return to
\par the spirit (or non-spirit) of the race.
\par 
\par We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even
\par as regards our talents for religion--we have POOR talents for it. One
\par may make an exception in the case of the Celts, who have theretofore
\par furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North: the
\par Christian ideal blossomed forth in France as much as ever the pale sun
\par of the north would allow it. How strangely pious for our taste are still
\par these later French skeptics, whenever there is any Celtic blood in their
\par origin! How Catholic, how un-German does Auguste Comte's Sociology
\par seem to us, with the Roman logic of its instincts! How Jesuitical, that
\par amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal, Sainte-Beuve, in spite of all
\par his hostility to Jesuits! And even Ernest Renan: how inaccessible to
\par us Northerners does the language of such a Renan appear, in whom
\par every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined
\par voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance! Let us repeat
\par after him these fine sentences--and what wickedness and haughtiness is
\par immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but
\par harder souls, that is to say, in our more German souls!--"DISONS DONC
\par HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE L'HOMME NORMAL, QUE L'HOMME
\par EST LE PLUS DANS LE VRAI QUANT IL EST LE PLUS RELIGIEUX ET LE PLUS
\par ASSURE D'UNE DESTINEE INFINIE.... C'EST QUAND IL EST BON QU'IL VEUT QUE
\par LA VIRTU CORRESPONDE A UN ORDER ETERNAL, C'EST QUAND IL CONTEMPLE LES
\par CHOSES D'UNE MANIERE DESINTERESSEE QU'IL TROUVE LA MORT REVOLTANTE ET
\par ABSURDE. COMMENT NE PAS SUPPOSER QUE C'EST DANS CES MOMENTS-LA, QUE
\par L'HOMME VOIT LE MIEUX?"... These sentences are so extremely ANTIPODAL
\par to my ears and habits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage
\par on finding them, I wrote on the margin, "LA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAR
\par EXCELLENCE!"--until in my later rage I even took a fancy to them, these
\par sentences with their truth absolutely inverted! It is so nice and such a
\par distinction to have one's own antipodes!
\par 
\par 49. That which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient
\par Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it pours
\par forth--it is a very superior kind of man who takes SUCH an attitude
\par towards nature and life.--Later on, when the populace got the upper hand
\par in Greece, FEAR became rampant also in religion; and Christianity was
\par preparing itself.
\par 
\par 50. The passion for God: there are churlish, honest-hearted, and
\par importunate kinds of it, like that of Luther--the whole of Protestantism
\par lacks the southern DELICATEZZA. There is an Oriental exaltation of the
\par mind in it, like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as
\par in the case of St. Augustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive
\par manner, all nobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine
\par tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs
\par for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In
\par many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl's
\par or youth's puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid,
\par also as her last ambition. The Church has frequently canonized the woman
\par in such a case.
\par 
\par 51. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before
\par the saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntary
\par privation--why did they thus bow? They divined in him--and as it were
\par behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance--the
\par superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation; the
\par strength of will, in which they recognized their own strength and
\par love of power, and knew how to honour it: they honoured something
\par in themselves when they honoured the saint. In addition to this, the
\par contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such an
\par enormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have been
\par coveted for nothing--they have said, inquiringly. There is perhaps a
\par reason for it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might
\par wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and
\par visitors? In a word, the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new
\par fear before him, they divined a new power, a strange, still unconquered
\par enemy:--it was the "Will to Power" which obliged them to halt before the
\par saint. They had to question him.
\par 
\par 52. In the Jewish "Old Testament," the book of divine justice, there are
\par men, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that Greek and Indian
\par literature has nothing to compare with it. One stands with fear and
\par reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and
\par one has sad thoughts about old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsula
\par Europe, which would like, by all means, to figure before Asia as the
\par "Progress of Mankind." To be sure, he who is himself only a slender,
\par tame house-animal, and knows only the wants of a house-animal (like
\par our cultured people of today, including the Christians of "cultured"
\par Christianity), need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins--the
\par taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to "great" and
\par "small": perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of grace,
\par still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the odour of the
\par genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in it). To have bound
\par up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along
\par with the Old Testament into one book, as the "Bible," as "The Book in
\par Itself," is perhaps the greatest audacity and "sin against the Spirit"
\par which literary Europe has upon its conscience.
\par 
\par 53. Why Atheism nowadays? "The father" in God is thoroughly refuted;
\par equally so "the judge," "the rewarder." Also his "free will": he does
\par not hear--and even if he did, he would not know how to help. The worst
\par is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is he
\par uncertain?--This is what I have made out (by questioning and listening
\par at a variety of conversations) to be the cause of the decline of
\par European theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct is
\par in vigorous growth,--it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound
\par distrust.
\par 
\par 54. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes--and
\par indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure--an
\par ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old
\par conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject
\par and predicate conception--that is to say, an ATTENTAT on the
\par fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophy,
\par as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN,
\par although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious.
\par Formerly, in effect, one believed in "the soul" as one believed in
\par grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, "I" is the condition,
\par "think" is the predicate and is conditioned--to think is an activity for
\par which one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made,
\par with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out
\par of this net,--to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: "think" the
\par condition, and "I" the conditioned; "I," therefore, only a synthesis
\par which has been MADE by thinking itself. KANT really wished to prove
\par that, starting from the subject, the subject could not be proved--nor
\par the object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the
\par subject, and therefore of "the soul," may not always have been strange
\par to him,--the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the
\par Vedanta philosophy.
\par 
\par 55. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but
\par three of these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificed
\par human beings to their God, and perhaps just those they loved the
\par best--to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive
\par religions, and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the
\par Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri, that most terrible of all Roman
\par anachronisms. Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed
\par to their God the strongest instincts they possessed, their "nature";
\par THIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and
\par "anti-natural" fanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed?
\par Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything
\par comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in
\par future blessedness and justice? Was it not necessary to sacrifice God
\par himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone, stupidity,
\par gravity, fate, nothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingness--this
\par paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the
\par rising generation; we all know something thereof already.
\par 
\par 56. Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire, has long
\par endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it
\par from the half-Christian, half-German narrowness and stupidity in which
\par it has finally presented itself to this century, namely, in the form of
\par Schopenhauer's philosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic
\par eye, has actually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of
\par all possible modes of thought--beyond good and evil, and no longer
\par like Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of
\par morality,--whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby, without
\par really desiring it, opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: the
\par ideal of the most world-approving, exuberant, and vivacious man, who has
\par not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and
\par is, but wishes to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity,
\par insatiably calling out da capo, not only to himself, but to the whole
\par piece and play; and not only the play, but actually to him who requires
\par the play--and makes it necessary; because he always requires
\par himself anew--and makes himself necessary.--What? And this would not
\par be--circulus vitiosus deus?
\par 
\par 57. The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with the
\par strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomes
\par profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever coming into
\par view. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised
\par its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise,
\par something of a game, something for children and childish minds. Perhaps
\par the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and
\par suffering, the conceptions "God" and "sin," will one day seem to us of
\par no more importance than a child's plaything or a child's pain seems to
\par an old man;--and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then
\par be necessary once more for "the old man"--always childish enough, an
\par eternal child!
\par 
\par 58. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or
\par semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its
\par favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft
\par placidity called "prayer," the state of perpetual readiness for the
\par "coming of God"), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the
\par idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic
\par sentiment that work is DISHONOURING--that it vulgarizes body and
\par soul--is not quite unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy,
\par time-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates
\par and prepares for "unbelief" more than anything else? Among these, for
\par instance, who are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I
\par find "free-thinkers" of diversified species and origin, but above all
\par a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation
\par has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what
\par purpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world
\par with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel themselves already fully
\par occupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their
\par pleasures, not to mention the "Fatherland," and the newspapers, and
\par their "family duties"; it seems that they have no time whatever left
\par for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a
\par question of a new business or a new pleasure--for it is impossible, they
\par say to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil
\par their tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs;
\par should certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require their
\par participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many
\par things are done--with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without
\par much curiosity or discomfort;--they live too much apart and outside
\par to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters. Among
\par those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of
\par German Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great
\par laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious
\par scholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of
\par the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives
\par psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part of
\par pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW
\par MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a
\par German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole
\par profession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to
\par which he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a
\par lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is
\par occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the "uncleanliness" of spirit
\par which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong
\par to the Church. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own
\par personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing
\par himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference
\par in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the
\par stage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one
\par step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety;
\par perhaps even the contrary. The practical indifference to religious
\par matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually
\par sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which
\par shuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the
\par depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the
\par delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.--Every age has
\par its own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages
\par may envy it: and how much naivete--adorable, childlike, and boundlessly
\par foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in
\par his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the
\par unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the
\par religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and
\par ABOVE which he himself has developed--he, the little arrogant dwarf
\par and mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of "ideas," of
\par "modern ideas"!
\par 
\par 59. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what
\par wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is their
\par preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and
\par false. Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration
\par of "pure forms" in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to be
\par doubted that whoever has NEED of the cult of the superficial to that
\par extent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it.
\par Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt
\par children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying
\par to FALSIFY its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might
\par guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which
\par they wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and
\par deified,--one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as
\par their HIGHEST rank. It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable
\par pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a
\par religious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which
\par divines that truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become
\par strong enough, hard enough, artist enough.... Piety, the "Life in God,"
\par regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and
\par ultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration
\par and artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all
\par falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at
\par any price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of
\par beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can become so artful, so
\par superficial, so iridescent, and so good, that his appearance no longer
\par offends.
\par 
\par 60. To love mankind FOR GOD'S SAKE--this has so far been the noblest and
\par remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. That love to mankind,
\par without any redeeming intention in the background, is only an ADDITIONAL
\par folly and brutishness, that the inclination to this love has first to
\par get its proportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling
\par of ambergris from a higher inclination--whoever first perceived
\par and "experienced" this, however his tongue may have stammered as it
\par attempted to express such a delicate matter, let him for all time be
\par holy and respected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone
\par astray in the finest fashion!
\par 
\par 61. The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him--as the man of
\par the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general
\par development of mankind,--will use religion for his disciplining and
\par educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political
\par and economic conditions. The selecting and disciplining
\par influence--destructive, as well as creative and fashioning--which can be
\par exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the
\par sort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who are
\par strong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the
\par judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is
\par an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of
\par authority--as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common,
\par betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter,
\par their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. And in the
\par case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior
\par spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative
\par life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government
\par (over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may
\par be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of
\par managing GROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE
\par filth of all political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood
\par this fact. With the help of a religious organization, they secured to
\par themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their
\par sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher
\par and super-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement and
\par opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future
\par ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which,
\par through fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight in
\par self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers sufficient
\par incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to
\par experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and
\par of solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of
\par educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary
\par baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally, to
\par ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and
\par general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives
\par invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart,
\par ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy,
\par with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of
\par justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all
\par the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the
\par religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually
\par harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it
\par operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon
\par sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner,
\par almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and
\par vindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity
\par and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate
\par themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby
\par to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it
\par difficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.
\par 
\par 62. To be sure--to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such
\par religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers--the cost is
\par always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an
\par educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but
\par rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end,
\par and not a means along with other means. Among men, as among all other
\par animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating,
\par infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases,
\par among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that
\par man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare
\par exception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents, the
\par greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the
\par law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests
\par itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of
\par men, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult
\par to determine. What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions
\par above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour
\par to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the
\par religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle;
\par they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a
\par disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as
\par false and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and
\par preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied,
\par and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of
\par man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions--to give a general appreciation
\par of them--are among the principal causes which have kept the type of
\par "man" upon a lower level--they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD
\par HAVE PERISHED. One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is
\par sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation
\par of all that the "spiritual men" of Christianity have done for Europe
\par hitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to
\par the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless,
\par and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual
\par penitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they
\par to do in order to work systematically in that fashion, and with a good
\par conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which
\par means, in deed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE
\par EUROPEAN RACE? To REVERSE all estimates of value--THAT is what they
\par had to do! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast
\par suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous,
\par manly, conquering, and imperious--all instincts which are natural to the
\par highest and most successful type of "man"--into uncertainty, distress
\par of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the
\par earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and
\par earthly things--THAT is the task the Church imposed on itself, and
\par was obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value,
\par "unworldliness," "unsensuousness," and "higher man" fused into one
\par sentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse
\par and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and
\par impartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never cease
\par marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will
\par has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIME
\par ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer
\par Epicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach this
\par almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in
\par the European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to
\par cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: "Oh, you bunglers, presumptuous
\par pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a work for your hands?
\par How you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you presumed
\par to do!"--I should say that Christianity has hitherto been the most
\par portentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough,
\par to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men,
\par not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime
\par self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and
\par perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically
\par different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from
\par man:--SUCH men, with their "equality before God," have hitherto swayed
\par the destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species
\par has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly,
\par mediocre, the European of the present day.
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER IV. APOPHTHEGMS AND INTERLUDES
\par 
\par 
\par 63. He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously--and even
\par himself--only in relation to his pupils.
\par 
\par 64. "Knowledge for its own sake"--that is the last snare laid by
\par morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more.
\par 
\par 65. The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has
\par to be overcome on the way to it.
\par 
\par 65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to
\par sin.
\par 
\par 66. The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed,
\par deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.
\par 
\par 67. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense
\par of all others. Love to God also!
\par 
\par 68. "I did that," says my memory. "I could not have done that," says my
\par pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually--the memory yields.
\par 
\par 69. One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand
\par that--kills with leniency.
\par 
\par 70. If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which
\par always recurs.
\par 
\par 71. THE SAGE AS ASTRONOMER.--So long as thou feelest the stars as an
\par "above thee," thou lackest the eye of the discerning one.
\par 
\par 72. It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that
\par makes great men.
\par 
\par 73. He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.
\par 
\par 73A. Many a peacock hides his tail from every eye--and calls it his
\par pride.
\par 
\par 74. A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two things
\par besides: gratitude and purity.
\par 
\par 75. The degree and nature of a man's sensuality extends to the highest
\par altitudes of his spirit.
\par 
\par 76. Under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself.
\par 
\par 77. With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify,
\par or honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men with the same
\par principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith.
\par 
\par 78. He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a
\par despiser.
\par 
\par 79. A soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself love,
\par betrays its sediment: its dregs come up.
\par 
\par 80. A thing that is explained ceases to concern us--What did the God
\par mean who gave the advice, "Know thyself!" Did it perhaps imply "Cease to
\par be concerned about thyself! become objective!"--And Socrates?--And the
\par "scientific man"?
\par 
\par 81. It is terrible to die of thirst at sea. Is it necessary that you
\par should so salt your truth that it will no longer--quench thirst?
\par 
\par 82. "Sympathy for all"--would be harshness and tyranny for THEE, my good
\par neighbour.
\par 
\par 83. INSTINCT--When the house is on fire one forgets even the
\par dinner--Yes, but one recovers it from among the ashes.
\par 
\par 84. Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she--forgets how to charm.
\par 
\par 85. The same emotions are in man and woman, but in different TEMPO, on
\par that account man and woman never cease to misunderstand each other.
\par 
\par 86. In the background of all their personal vanity, women themselves
\par have still their impersonal scorn--for "woman".
\par 
\par 87. FETTERED HEART, FREE SPIRIT--When one firmly fetters one's heart
\par and keeps it prisoner, one can allow one's spirit many liberties: I said
\par this once before But people do not believe it when I say so, unless they
\par know it already.
\par 
\par 88. One begins to distrust very clever persons when they become
\par embarrassed.
\par 
\par 89. Dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences
\par them is not something dreadful also.
\par 
\par 90. Heavy, melancholy men turn lighter, and come temporarily to their
\par surface, precisely by that which makes others heavy--by hatred and love.
\par 
\par 91. So cold, so icy, that one burns one's finger at the touch of him!
\par Every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back!--And for that very reason
\par many think him red-hot.
\par 
\par 92. Who has not, at one time or another--sacrificed himself for the sake
\par of his good name?
\par 
\par 93. In affability there is no hatred of men, but precisely on that
\par account a great deal too much contempt of men.
\par 
\par 94. The maturity of man--that means, to have reacquired the seriousness
\par that one had as a child at play.
\par 
\par 95. To be ashamed of one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the end
\par of which one is ashamed also of one's morality.
\par 
\par 96. One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa--blessing
\par it rather than in love with it.
\par 
\par 97. What? A great man? I always see merely the play-actor of his own
\par ideal.
\par 
\par 98. When one trains one's conscience, it kisses one while it bites.
\par 
\par 99. THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS--"I listened for the echo and I heard
\par only praise."
\par 
\par 100. We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus
\par relax ourselves away from our fellows.
\par 
\par 101. A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as the
\par animalization of God.
\par 
\par 102. Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with
\par regard to the beloved. "What! She is modest enough to love even you? Or
\par stupid enough? Or--or---"
\par 
\par 103. THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.--"Everything now turns out best for me, I
\par now love every fate:--who would like to be my fate?"
\par 
\par 104. Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love,
\par prevents the Christians of today--burning us.
\par 
\par 105. The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the "piety")
\par of the free spirit (the "pious man of knowledge") than the impia fraus.
\par Hence the profound lack of judgment, in comparison with the Church,
\par characteristic of the type "free spirit"--as ITS non-freedom.
\par 
\par 106. By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.
\par 
\par 107. A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has been
\par taken, to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments. Occasionally,
\par therefore, a will to stupidity.
\par 
\par 108. There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral
\par interpretation of phenomena.
\par 
\par 109. The criminal is often enough not equal to his deed: he extenuates
\par and maligns it.
\par 
\par 110. The advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to turn the
\par beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of the doer.
\par 
\par 111. Our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride has been
\par wounded.
\par 
\par 112. To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to
\par belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against
\par them.
\par 
\par 113. "You want to prepossess him in your favour? Then you must be
\par embarrassed before him."
\par 
\par 114. The immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the coyness
\par in this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women at the outset.
\par 
\par 115. Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman's play is
\par mediocre.
\par 
\par 116. The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage
\par to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.
\par 
\par 117. The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of
\par another, or of several other, emotions.
\par 
\par 118. There is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him to whom
\par it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day.
\par 
\par 119. Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning
\par ourselves--"justifying" ourselves.
\par 
\par 120. Sensuality often forces the growth of love too much, so that its
\par root remains weak, and is easily torn up.
\par 
\par 121. It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished to turn
\par author--and that he did not learn it better.
\par 
\par 122. To rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely politeness
\par of heart--and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.
\par 
\par 123. Even concubinage has been corrupted--by marriage.
\par 
\par 124. He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because
\par of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. A parable.
\par 
\par 125. When we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge heavily
\par to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us.
\par 
\par 126. A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven great
\par men.--Yes, and then to get round them.
\par 
\par 127. In the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the sense of
\par shame. They feel as if one wished to peep under their skin with it--or
\par worse still! under their dress and finery.
\par 
\par 128. The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you
\par allure the senses to it.
\par 
\par 129. The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on that
\par account he keeps so far away from him:--the devil, in effect, as the
\par oldest friend of knowledge.
\par 
\par 130. What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent
\par decreases,--when he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also an
\par adornment; an adornment is also a concealment.
\par 
\par 131. The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that
\par in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal, to
\par express it more agreeably). Thus man wishes woman to be peaceable: but
\par in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable, like the cat, however well she
\par may have assumed the peaceable demeanour.
\par 
\par 132. One is punished best for one's virtues.
\par 
\par 133. He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more frivolously and
\par shamelessly than the man without an ideal.
\par 
\par 134. From the senses originate all trustworthiness, all good conscience,
\par all evidence of truth.
\par 
\par 135. Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a considerable
\par part of it is rather an essential condition of being good.
\par 
\par 136. The one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other seeks some
\par one whom he can assist: a good conversation thus originates.
\par 
\par 137. In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes
\par of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds
\par a mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very
\par remarkable man.
\par 
\par 138. We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and
\par imagine him with whom we have intercourse--and forget it immediately.
\par 
\par 139. In revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man.
\par 
\par 140. ADVICE AS A RIDDLE.--"If the band is not to break, bite it
\par first--secure to make!"
\par 
\par 141. The belly is the reason why man does not so readily take himself
\par for a God.
\par 
\par 142. The chastest utterance I ever heard: "Dans le veritable amour c'est
\par l'ame qui enveloppe le corps."
\par 
\par 143. Our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for what is
\par most difficult to us.--Concerning the origin of many systems of morals.
\par 
\par 144. When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally
\par something wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself conduces to a
\par certain virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may say so, is "the barren
\par animal."
\par 
\par 145. Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman would
\par not have the genius for adornment, if she had not the instinct for the
\par SECONDARY role.
\par 
\par 146. He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby
\par become a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will
\par also gaze into thee.
\par 
\par 147. From old Florentine novels--moreover, from life: Buona femmina e
\par mala femmina vuol bastone.--Sacchetti, Nov. 86.
\par 
\par 148. To seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and afterwards
\par to believe implicitly in this opinion of their neighbour--who can do
\par this conjuring trick so well as women?
\par 
\par 149. That which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable echo of
\par what was formerly considered good--the atavism of an old ideal.
\par 
\par 150. Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the
\par demigod everything becomes a satyr-play; and around God everything
\par becomes--what? perhaps a "world"?
\par 
\par 151. It is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have your
\par permission to possess it;--eh, my friends?
\par 
\par 152. "Where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always Paradise":
\par so say the most ancient and the most modern serpents.
\par 
\par 153. What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil.
\par 
\par 154. Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of
\par health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.
\par 
\par 155. The sense of the tragic increases and declines with sensuousness.
\par 
\par 156. Insanity in individuals is something rare--but in groups, parties,
\par nations, and epochs it is the rule.
\par 
\par 157. The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one
\par gets successfully through many a bad night.
\par 
\par 158. Not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to our
\par strongest impulse--the tyrant in us.
\par 
\par 159. One MUST repay good and ill; but why just to the person who did us
\par good or ill?
\par 
\par 160. One no longer loves one's knowledge sufficiently after one has
\par communicated it.
\par 
\par 161. Poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they exploit them.
\par 
\par 162. "Our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our neighbour's
\par neighbour":--so thinks every nation.
\par 
\par 163. Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a lover--his
\par rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to his
\par normal character.
\par 
\par 164. Jesus said to his Jews: "The law was for servants;--love God as I
\par love him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with morals!"
\par 
\par 165. IN SIGHT OF EVERY PARTY.--A shepherd has always need of a
\par bell-wether--or he has himself to be a wether occasionally.
\par 
\par 166. One may indeed lie with the mouth; but with the accompanying
\par grimace one nevertheless tells the truth.
\par 
\par 167. To vigorous men intimacy is a matter of shame--and something
\par precious.
\par 
\par 168. Christianity gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it,
\par certainly, but degenerated to Vice.
\par 
\par 169. To talk much about oneself may also be a means of concealing
\par oneself.
\par 
\par 170. In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.
\par 
\par 171. Pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge, like
\par tender hands on a Cyclops.
\par 
\par 172. One occasionally embraces some one or other, out of love to mankind
\par (because one cannot embrace all); but this is what one must never
\par confess to the individual.
\par 
\par 173. One does not hate as long as one disesteems, but only when one
\par esteems equal or superior.
\par 
\par 174. Ye Utilitarians--ye, too, love the UTILE only as a VEHICLE for
\par your inclinations,--ye, too, really find the noise of its wheels
\par insupportable!
\par 
\par 175. One loves ultimately one's desires, not the thing desired.
\par 
\par 176. The vanity of others is only counter to our taste when it is
\par counter to our vanity.
\par 
\par 177. With regard to what "truthfulness" is, perhaps nobody has ever been
\par sufficiently truthful.
\par 
\par 178. One does not believe in the follies of clever men: what a
\par forfeiture of the rights of man!
\par 
\par 179. The consequences of our actions seize us by the forelock, very
\par indifferent to the fact that we have meanwhile "reformed."
\par 
\par 180. There is an innocence in lying which is the sign of good faith in a
\par cause.
\par 
\par 181. It is inhuman to bless when one is being cursed.
\par 
\par 182. The familiarity of superiors embitters one, because it may not be
\par returned.
\par 
\par 183. "I am affected, not because you have deceived me, but because I can
\par no longer believe in you."
\par 
\par 184. There is a haughtiness of kindness which has the appearance of
\par wickedness.
\par 
\par 185. "I dislike him."--Why?--"I am not a match for him."--Did any one
\par ever answer so?
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER V. THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS
\par 
\par 
\par 186. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle,
\par belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the "Science of Morals"
\par belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:--an
\par interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious
\par in the very person of a moralist. Indeed, the expression, "Science
\par of Morals" is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too
\par presumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,--which is always a foretaste of
\par more modest expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT
\par is still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the
\par present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey
\par and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth,
\par and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish--and
\par perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common
\par forms of these living crystallizations--as preparation for a THEORY OF
\par TYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.
\par All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness,
\par demanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and
\par ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science:
\par they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality--and every philosopher hitherto
\par has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has
\par been regarded as something "given." How far from their awkward pride
\par was the seemingly insignificant problem--left in dust and decay--of a
\par description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands
\par and senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing to
\par moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary
\par epitome, or an accidental abridgement--perhaps as the morality of
\par their environment, their position, their church, their Zeitgeist, their
\par climate and zone--it was precisely because they were badly instructed
\par with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager
\par to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the
\par real problems of morals--problems which only disclose themselves by
\par a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every "Science of Morals"
\par hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself
\par has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything
\par problematic there! That which philosophers called "giving a basis to
\par morality," and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light,
\par proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new
\par means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the
\par sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of
\par denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question--and
\par in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and
\par vivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what
\par innocence--almost worthy of honour--Schopenhauer represents his own
\par task, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a
\par "Science" whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and
\par old wives: "The principle," he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der
\par Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality,
\par translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] "the axiom about the
\par purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede,
\par immo omnes quantum potes juva--is REALLY the proposition which all moral
\par teachers strive to establish, ... the REAL basis of ethics which
\par has been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries."--The
\par difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be
\par great--it is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his
\par efforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and
\par sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will
\par to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist,
\par ACTUALLY--played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read about
\par the matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a
\par repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at morality--who
\par assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what?
\par Is that really--a pessimist?
\par 
\par 187. Apart from the value of such assertions as "there is a categorical
\par imperative in us," one can always ask: What does such an assertion
\par indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are
\par meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems
\par of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied;
\par with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others
\par he wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others
\par to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,--this system of
\par morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something
\par of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and
\par creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant
\par especially, gives us to understand by his morals that "what is estimable
\par in me, is that I know how to obey--and with you it SHALL not be
\par otherwise than with me!" In short, systems of morals are only a
\par SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.
\par 
\par 188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of
\par tyranny against "nature" and also against "reason", that is, however, no
\par objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that
\par all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is
\par essential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a
\par long constraint. In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal,
\par or Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every
\par language has attained to strength and freedom--the metrical constraint,
\par the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and
\par orators of every nation given themselves!--not excepting some of
\par the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable
\par conscientiousness--"for the sake of a folly," as utilitarian bunglers
\par say, and thereby deem themselves wise--"from submission to arbitrary
\par laws," as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves "free," even
\par free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however, that everything
\par of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly
\par certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself,
\par or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in
\par conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary
\par law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely
\par this is "nature" and "natural"--and not laisser-aller! Every artist
\par knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his
\par "most natural" condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing,
\par and constructing in the moments of "inspiration"--and how strictly and
\par delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness
\par and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most
\par stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold,
\par and ambiguous in it). The essential thing "in heaven and in earth" is,
\par apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE
\par in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in
\par the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance,
\par virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality--anything whatever
\par that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of
\par the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of
\par ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think
\par in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable
\par to Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret
\par everything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every
\par occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:--all this
\par violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness,
\par has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has
\par attained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility;
\par granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be
\par stifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere,
\par "nature" shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT
\par magnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). That
\par for centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove
\par something--nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker
\par who "wishes to prove something"--that it was always settled beforehand
\par what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps
\par in the Asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the
\par present day in the innocent, Christian-moral explanation of immediate
\par personal events "for the glory of God," or "for the good of the
\par soul":--this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent
\par stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and
\par the finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual
\par education and discipline. One may look at every system of morals in this
\par light: it is "nature" therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller,
\par the too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for
\par immediate duties--it teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in
\par a certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development.
\par "Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come
\par to grief, and lose all respect for thyself"--this seems to me to be the
\par moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither "categorical,"
\par as old Kant wished (consequently the "otherwise"), nor does it address
\par itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!),
\par but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the
\par animal "man" generally, to MANKIND.
\par 
\par 189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a
\par master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such
\par an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week--and
\par work-day again:--as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated
\par FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although,
\par as is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect
\par to work). Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful
\par influences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary
\par days are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to
\par hunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and
\par epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism,
\par seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during
\par which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself--at the same time
\par also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise
\par admit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst
\par of Hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with
\par Aphrodisiacal odours).--Here also is a hint for the explanation of the
\par paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period of European
\par history, and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments,
\par that the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).
\par 
\par 190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really
\par belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might
\par say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was
\par too noble. "No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done
\par unwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do
\par so, however, if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is
\par only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily
\par make him--good."--This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who
\par perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically
\par judge that "it is STUPID to do wrong"; while they accept "good" as
\par identical with "useful and pleasant," without further thought. As
\par regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it
\par has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.--Plato
\par did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the
\par tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into them--he,
\par the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out
\par of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless
\par and impossible modifications--namely, in all his own disguises and
\par multiplicities. In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the
\par Platonic Socrates, if not--[Greek words inserted here.]
\par 
\par 191. The old theological problem of "Faith" and "Knowledge," or more
\par plainly, of instinct and reason--the question whether, in respect to the
\par valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality,
\par which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to
\par a "Why," that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility--it
\par is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of
\par Socrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity. Socrates
\par himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent--that of a
\par surpassing dialectician--took first the side of reason; and, in fact,
\par what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the
\par noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could
\par never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?
\par In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also
\par at himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found
\par in himself the same difficulty and incapacity. "But why"--he said
\par to himself--"should one on that account separate oneself from the
\par instincts! One must set them right, and the reason ALSO--one must follow
\par the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them
\par with good arguments." This was the real FALSENESS of that great and
\par mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he
\par was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived
\par the irrationality in the moral judgment.--Plato, more innocent in such
\par matters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to
\par himself, at the expenditure of all his strength--the greatest strength
\par a philosopher had ever expended--that reason and instinct lead
\par spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to "God"; and since Plato, all
\par theologians and philosophers have followed the same path--which means
\par that in matters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it,
\par "Faith," or as I call it, "the herd") has hitherto triumphed. Unless
\par one should make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of
\par rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution), who
\par recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and
\par Descartes was superficial.
\par 
\par 192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in
\par its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest
\par processes of all "knowledge and cognizance": there, as here, the
\par premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to "belief,"
\par and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed--our senses
\par learn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and
\par cautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given
\par occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon
\par the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more
\par force, more "morality." It is difficult and painful for the ear to
\par listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hear
\par another language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds
\par into words with which we are more familiar and conversant--it was thus,
\par for example, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into
\par ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse to the
\par new; and generally, even in the "simplest" processes of sensation, the
\par emotions DOMINATE--such as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion
\par of indolence.--As little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words
\par (not to speak of syllables) of a page--he rather takes about five out
\par of every twenty words at random, and "guesses" the probably appropriate
\par sense to them--just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely
\par in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so
\par much easier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the
\par most remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the
\par greater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate
\par any event, EXCEPT as "inventors" thereof. All this goes to prove
\par that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have
\par been--ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to express it more politely and
\par hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly--one is much more of an artist
\par than one is aware of.--In an animated conversation, I often see the face
\par of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined
\par before me, according to the thought he expresses, or which I believe to
\par be evoked in his mind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the
\par STRENGTH of my visual faculty--the delicacy of the play of the muscles
\par and of the expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me.
\par Probably the person put on quite a different expression, or none at all.
\par 
\par 193. Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. What we
\par experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at
\par last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything
\par "actually" experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we
\par have a requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and
\par even in the brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some
\par extent by the nature of our dreams. Supposing that someone has often
\par flown in his dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is
\par conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his
\par peculiarly enviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the
\par slightest impulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who
\par knows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an "upwards"
\par without effort or constraint, a "downwards" without descending
\par or lowering--without TROUBLE!--how could the man with such
\par dream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find "happiness" differently
\par coloured and defined, even in his waking hours! How could he fail--to
\par long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? "Flight," such as is described by poets,
\par must, when compared with his own "flying," be far too earthly, muscular,
\par violent, far too "troublesome" for him.
\par 
\par 194. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the
\par difference of their lists of desirable things--in their regarding
\par different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to
\par the greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized
\par desirable things:--it manifests itself much more in what they regard as
\par actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a woman,
\par for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification
\par serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the
\par more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for
\par possession, sees the "questionableness," the mere apparentness of such
\par ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially
\par whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for
\par his sake what she has or would like to have--only THEN does he look upon
\par her as "possessed." A third, however, has not even here got to the limit
\par of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether
\par the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do
\par so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed,
\par profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let
\par himself be found out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in
\par his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when
\par she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed
\par insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. One
\par man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of
\par Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more
\par refined thirst for possession, says to himself: "One may not deceive
\par where one desires to possess"--he is irritated and impatient at the idea
\par that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: "I must,
\par therefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!"
\par Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward
\par craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as
\par though, for instance, he should "merit" help, seek just THEIR help, and
\par would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them
\par for all help. With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a
\par property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a
\par desire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed or
\par forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something like
\par themselves out of their children--they call that "education"; no mother
\par doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is
\par thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN
\par ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it
\par right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly
\par born (as among the ancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the
\par teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new
\par individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. The
\par consequence is...
\par 
\par 195. The Jews--a people "born for slavery," as Tacitus and the whole
\par ancient world say of them; "the chosen people among the nations," as
\par they themselves say and believe--the Jews performed the miracle of the
\par inversion of valuations, by means of which life on earth obtained a new
\par and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. Their prophets fused
\par into one the expressions "rich," "godless," "wicked," "violent,"
\par "sensual," and for the first time coined the word "world" as a term of
\par reproach. In this inversion of valuations (in which is also included
\par the use of the word "poor" as synonymous with "saint" and "friend") the
\par significance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM that
\par the SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.
\par 
\par 196. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies near the
\par sun--such as we shall never see. Among ourselves, this is an allegory;
\par and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing merely as an
\par allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed.
\par 
\par 197. The beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, Caesar Borgia)
\par are fundamentally misunderstood, "nature" is misunderstood, so long as
\par one seeks a "morbidness" in the constitution of these healthiest of
\par all tropical monsters and growths, or even an innate "hell" in them--as
\par almost all moralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there is
\par a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists? And
\par that the "tropical man" must be discredited at all costs, whether
\par as disease and deterioration of mankind, or as his own hell and
\par self-torture? And why? In favour of the "temperate zones"? In favour
\par of the temperate men? The "moral"? The mediocre?--This for the chapter:
\par "Morals as Timidity."
\par 
\par 198. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to
\par their "happiness," as it is called--what else are they but suggestions
\par for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which
\par the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and bad
\par propensities, insofar as such have the Will to Power and would like
\par to play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations,
\par permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife
\par wisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form--because
\par they address themselves to "all," because they generalize where
\par generalization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally,
\par and taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely
\par with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and sometimes even
\par seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously,
\par especially of "the other world." That is all of little value when
\par estimated intellectually, and is far from being "science," much less
\par "wisdom"; but, repeated once more, and three times repeated, it is
\par expediency, expediency, expediency, mixed with stupidity, stupidity,
\par stupidity--whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness
\par towards the heated folly of the emotions, which the Stoics advised and
\par fostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping of Spinoza, the
\par destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he
\par recommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent
\par mean at which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism of morals;
\par or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary
\par attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art, perhaps as
\par music, or as love of God, and of mankind for God's sake--for in religion
\par the passions are once more enfranchised, provided that...; or, finally,
\par even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has
\par been taught by Hafis and Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the
\par spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of
\par wise old codgers and drunkards, with whom it "no longer has much
\par danger."--This also for the chapter: "Morals as Timidity."
\par 
\par 199. Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have
\par also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples,
\par states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion
\par to the small number who command--in view, therefore, of the fact that
\par obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto,
\par one may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is
\par now innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives
\par the command "Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally
\par refrain from something", in short, "Thou shalt". This need tries to
\par satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its
\par strength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous
\par appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into
\par its ear by all sorts of commanders--parents, teachers, laws, class
\par prejudices, or public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human
\par development, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and
\par turning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of
\par obedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If
\par one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders
\par and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they
\par will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose
\par a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to
\par command just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of things
\par actually exists in Europe at present--I call it the moral hypocrisy of
\par the commanding class. They know no other way of protecting themselves
\par from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older
\par and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of
\par the law, or of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims
\par from the current opinions of the herd, as "first servants of their
\par people," or "instruments of the public weal". On the other hand, the
\par gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only
\par kind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as
\par public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty,
\par indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and
\par useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however,
\par where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed
\par with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders
\par by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative
\par constitutions, for example, are of this origin. In spite of all, what a
\par blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the
\par appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeans--of this
\par fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proof
\par the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of
\par the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its
\par worthiest individuals and periods.
\par 
\par 200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with
\par one another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his
\par body--that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts
\par and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom
\par at peace--such a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an
\par average, be a weak man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is
\par IN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character
\par of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean
\par or Christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of
\par undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unity--it is the "Sabbath of
\par Sabbaths," to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine,
\par who was himself such a man.--Should, however, the contrariety and
\par conflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus
\par to life--and if, on the other hand, in addition to their powerful and
\par irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited and indoctrinated
\par into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict
\par with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of self-control and
\par self-deception), there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and
\par inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men, predestined for conquering
\par and circumventing others, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades
\par and Caesar (with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans
\par according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second), and
\par among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear precisely in the
\par same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for repose, comes
\par to the front; the two types are complementary to each other, and spring
\par from the same causes.
\par 
\par 201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only
\par gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only
\par kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in
\par what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be
\par no "morality of love to one's neighbour." Granted even that there is
\par already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness,
\par gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition
\par of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly
\par distinguished by honourable names as "virtues," and eventually almost
\par coincide with the conception "morality": in that period they do not
\par as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations--they are still
\par ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good
\par nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should
\par it be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this
\par praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared
\par with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES
\par PUBLICA. After all, "love to our neighbour" is always a secondary
\par matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to
\par our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the
\par whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this
\par fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral
\par valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of
\par enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and
\par love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the
\par point of view of general utility--under other names, of course, than
\par those here given--but had to be fostered and cultivated (because they
\par were perpetually required in the common danger against the common
\par enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong--when
\par the outlets for them are lacking--and are gradually branded as immoral
\par and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations now
\par attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its
\par conclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community or
\par to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a
\par disposition, or an endowment--that is now the moral perspective, here
\par again fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest
\par instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual
\par far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious
\par conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its
\par belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these
\par very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independent
\par spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are
\par felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the
\par herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called
\par EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing
\par disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and
\par honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always
\par less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity
\par and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins
\par to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and
\par self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, "the lamb,"
\par and still more "the sheep," wins respect. There is a point of diseased
\par mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society
\par itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL,
\par and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it
\par to be somehow unfair--it is certain that the idea of "punishment" and
\par "the obligation to punish" are then painful and alarming to people. "Is
\par it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we
\par still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!"--with these questions
\par gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate
\par conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear,
\par one would have done away with this morality at the same time, it
\par would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer
\par necessary!--Whoever examines the conscience of the present-day European,
\par will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds
\par and hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd "we wish
\par that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!" Some time
\par or other--the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called "progress" all
\par over Europe.
\par 
\par 202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred
\par times, for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths--OUR
\par truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one
\par plainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will
\par be accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to
\par men of "modern ideas" that we have constantly applied the terms "herd,"
\par "herd-instincts," and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot
\par do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We
\par have found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become
\par unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence
\par prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he
\par did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to
\par teach--they "know" today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard
\par and be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which
\par here thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise
\par and blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human
\par animal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more
\par to the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts,
\par according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance
\par of which it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS
\par HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the matter,
\par only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after
\par which many other moralities, and above all HIGHER moralities, are or
\par should be possible. Against such a "possibility," against such a "should
\par be," however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it
\par says obstinately and inexorably "I am morality itself and nothing else
\par is morality!" Indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured
\par and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have
\par reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of
\par this morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC
\par movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement. That its TEMPO,
\par however, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for
\par those who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated
\par by the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised
\par teeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the
\par highways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the peacefully
\par industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and still more so
\par to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call
\par themselves Socialists and want a "free society," those are really at one
\par with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form
\par of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of
\par repudiating the notions "master" and "servant"--ni dieu ni maitre, says
\par a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every
\par special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately
\par opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs "rights"
\par any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it
\par were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of
\par all former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy,
\par in their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the
\par very animals, up even to "God"--the extravagance of "sympathy for
\par God" belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and
\par impatience of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering
\par generally, in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or
\par ALLOWING it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening,
\par under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new
\par Buddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as
\par though it were morality in itself, the climax, the ATTAINED climax of
\par mankind, the sole hope of the future, the consolation of the present,
\par the great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether at
\par one in their belief in the community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and
\par therefore in "themselves."
\par 
\par 203. We, who hold a different belief--we, who regard the democratic
\par movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but
\par as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his
\par mediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes? In
\par NEW PHILOSOPHERS--there is no other alternative: in minds strong and
\par original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue
\par and invert "eternal valuations"; in forerunners, in men of the future,
\par who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which
\par will compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future
\par of humanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make
\par preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in
\par rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end to the frightful
\par rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of
\par "history" (the folly of the "greatest number" is only its last
\par form)--for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will
\par some time or other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that
\par has existed in the way of occult, terrible, and benevolent beings might
\par look pale and dwarfed. The image of such leaders hovers before OUR
\par eyes:--is it lawful for me to say it aloud, ye free spirits? The
\par conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for
\par their genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which
\par a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a
\par CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the new
\par pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart
\par transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such responsibility;
\par and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the dreadful
\par danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:--these
\par are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits!
\par these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the
\par heaven of OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen,
\par divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and
\par deteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger
\par of "man" himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the
\par extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in
\par respect to the future of mankind--a game in which neither the hand, nor
\par even a "finger of God" has participated!--he who divines the fate that
\par is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of
\par "modern ideas," and still more under the whole of Christo-European
\par morality--suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared.
\par He sees at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through
\par a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and
\par arrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how
\par unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and how often
\par in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions
\par and new paths:--he knows still better from his painfulest recollections
\par on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank
\par have hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become
\par contemptible. The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of
\par the "man of the future"--as idealized by the socialistic fools and
\par shallow-pates--this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely
\par gregarious animal (or as they call it, to a man of "free society"),
\par this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is
\par undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to its
\par ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of
\par mankind--and perhaps also a new MISSION!
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER VI. WE SCHOLARS
\par 
\par 
\par 204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that
\par which it has always been--namely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES,
\par according to Balzac--I would venture to protest against an improper and
\par injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the
\par best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations
\par of science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right
\par out of one's own EXPERIENCE--experience, as it seems to me, always
\par implies unfortunate experience?--to treat of such an important question
\par of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST science
\par like women and artists ("Ah! this dreadful science!" sigh their instinct
\par and their shame, "it always FINDS THINGS OUT!"). The declaration of
\par independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy,
\par is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and
\par disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of
\par the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best
\par springtime--which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise
\par smells sweet. Here also the instinct of the populace cries, "Freedom
\par from all masters!" and after science has, with the happiest results,
\par resisted theology, whose "hand-maid" it had been too long, it now
\par proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for
\par philosophy, and in its turn to play the "master"--what am I saying!
\par to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory--the memory of
\par a scientific man, if you please!--teems with the naivetes of insolence
\par which I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young
\par naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and
\par most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters,
\par who are both the one and the other by profession). On one occasion it
\par was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the
\par defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time
\par it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined
\par luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt
\par himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the
\par colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but
\par a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which "does
\par nobody any good". At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of
\par the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another
\par time the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily
\par extended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most
\par frequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars,
\par the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the
\par whole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his
\par scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of--the
\par result being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to
\par me, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern
\par Germany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in
\par severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection
\par with German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been
\par an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but
\par precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive,
\par and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking
\par generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the
\par modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which
\par has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the
\par doors to the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to
\par what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the
\par world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal
\par and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what
\par justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and
\par origin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to
\par the fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down
\par below--in Germany, for instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist
\par Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially
\par the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves
\par "realists," or "positivists," which is calculated to implant a
\par dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those
\par philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists,
\par that is very evident! All of them are persons who have been vanquished
\par and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science, who at one time
\par or another claimed more from themselves, without having a right to the
\par "more" and its responsibility--and who now, creditably, rancorously, and
\par vindictively, represent in word and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task
\par and supremacy of philosophy After all, how could it be otherwise?
\par Science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible
\par on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern philosophy has
\par gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites
\par distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to
\par a "theory of knowledge," no more in fact than a diffident science of
\par epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even
\par gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right
\par to enter--that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony,
\par something that awakens pity. How could such a philosophy--RULE!
\par 
\par 205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in
\par fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit
\par could still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the
\par sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability
\par that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach
\par himself somewhere and "specialize" so that he will no longer attain to
\par his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection,
\par and his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his
\par maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and
\par deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no
\par longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his
\par intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the
\par way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a
\par milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost
\par his self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should
\par aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and
\par spiritual rat-catcher--in short, a misleader. This is in the last
\par instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of
\par conscience. To double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is
\par also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not
\par concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life--he learns
\par unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain
\par this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief
\par only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying)
\par experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the
\par philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either
\par with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously
\par elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-intoxicated
\par man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives
\par "wisely," or "as a philosopher," it hardly means anything more than
\par "prudently and apart." Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind
\par of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a
\par bad game; but the GENUINE philosopher--does it not seem so to US,
\par my friends?--lives "unphilosophically" and "unwisely," above all,
\par IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts
\par and temptations of life--he risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS bad
\par game.
\par 
\par 206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either
\par ENGENDERS or PRODUCES--both words understood in their fullest sense--the
\par man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of
\par the old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two
\par principal functions of man. To both, of course, to the scholar and
\par to the old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of
\par indemnification--in these cases one emphasizes the respectability--and
\par yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture
\par of vexation. Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man?
\par Firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is
\par to say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type
\par of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file,
\par equability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the
\par instinct for people like himself, and for that which they require--for
\par instance: the portion of independence and green meadow without which
\par there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration
\par (which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability),
\par the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and
\par usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of
\par the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and
\par again to be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also
\par maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and
\par has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations
\par he cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go,
\par but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he
\par stands all the colder and more reserved--his eye is then like a smooth
\par and irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy.
\par The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results
\par from the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of
\par mediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of
\par the exceptional man, and endeavours to break--or still better, to
\par relax--every bent bow To relax, of course, with consideration, and
\par naturally with an indulgent hand--to RELAX with confiding sympathy
\par that is the real art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to
\par introduce itself as the religion of sympathy.
\par 
\par 207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit--and
\par who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded
\par IPSISIMOSITY!--in the end, however, one must learn caution even with
\par regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with
\par which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been
\par celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation
\par and glorification--as is especially accustomed to happen in the
\par pessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the
\par highest honours to "disinterested knowledge" The objective man, who no
\par longer curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning
\par in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand
\par complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly
\par instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more
\par powerful He is only an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRROR--he is no
\par "purpose in himself" The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed
\par to prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such
\par desires only as knowing or "reflecting" implies--he waits until
\par something comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that even the
\par light footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on
\par his surface and film Whatever "personality" he still possesses seems to
\par him accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he
\par come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms
\par and events He calls up the recollection of "himself" with an effort,
\par and not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other
\par persons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only
\par is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health,
\par or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack
\par of companions and society--indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his
\par suffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE
\par GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how
\par to help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote time
\par to himself he is serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack
\par of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual
\par complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant
\par and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that
\par comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous
\par indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which
\par he has to atone for these virtues of his!--and as man generally, he
\par becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one
\par wish love or hatred from him--I mean love and hatred as God, woman, and
\par animal understand them--he will do what he can, and furnish what he can.
\par But one must not be surprised if it should not be much--if he should
\par show himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and
\par deteriorated. His love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and
\par rather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He is
\par only genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality
\par is he still "nature" and "natural." His mirroring and eternally
\par self-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to
\par deny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. "JE NE MEPRISE
\par PRESQUE RIEN"--he says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue
\par the PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of any
\par one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far off to have
\par any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. If he has
\par been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with the Caesarian trainer
\par and dictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what
\par is more essential in him has been overlooked--he is an instrument,
\par something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but
\par nothing in himself--PRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrument,
\par a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and
\par mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected; but he
\par is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man in whom the
\par REST of existence justifies itself, no termination--and still less a
\par commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing hardy, powerful,
\par self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a soft, inflated,
\par delicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some kind of content
\par and frame to "shape" itself thereto--for the most part a man without
\par frame and content, a "selfless" man. Consequently, also, nothing for
\par women, IN PARENTHESI.
\par 
\par 208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic--I
\par hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the
\par objective spirit?--people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on
\par that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many,
\par many questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so
\par many, he is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of
\par skepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening
\par sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried
\par somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian
\par NIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means
\par denial, but--dreadful thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind of
\par "good-will"--a will to the veritable, actual negation of life--there is,
\par as is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative
\par than skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism;
\par and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an
\par antidote to the "spirit," and its underground noises. "Are not our ears
\par already full of bad sounds?" say the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and
\par almost as a kind of safety police; "this subterranean Nay is terrible!
\par Be still, ye pessimistic moles!" The skeptic, in effect, that delicate
\par creature, is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled so
\par as to start at every Nay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels
\par something like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!--they seem to him opposed
\par to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his virtue
\par by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with Montaigne: "What do I
\par know?" Or with Socrates: "I know that I know nothing." Or: "Here I do
\par not trust myself, no door is open to me." Or: "Even if the door were
\par open, why should I enter immediately?" Or: "What is the use of any hasty
\par hypotheses? It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses
\par at all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is
\par crooked? to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not time
\par enough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons, can ye not
\par at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx, too, is a
\par Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher."--Thus does a skeptic console
\par himself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For skepticism is
\par the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological
\par temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and
\par sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long
\par separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In the new
\par generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and
\par valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and
\par tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues
\par prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast,
\par and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That, however,
\par which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the
\par WILL; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or
\par the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing--they are doubtful of the
\par "freedom of the will" even in their dreams Our present-day Europe,
\par the scene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of
\par classes, and CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its
\par heights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which
\par springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with
\par gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs--and
\par often sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will, where do we not
\par find this cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes' How
\par seductively ornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises
\par for this disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself
\par nowadays in the show-cases as "objectiveness," "the scientific spirit,"
\par "L'ART POUR L'ART," and "pure voluntary knowledge," is only decked-out
\par skepticism and paralysis of will--I am ready to answer for this
\par diagnosis of the European disease--The disease of the will is diffused
\par unequally over Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization
\par has longest prevailed, it decreases according as "the barbarian"
\par still--or again--asserts his claims under the loose drapery of Western
\par culture It is therefore in the France of today, as can be readily
\par disclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm, and France,
\par which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the
\par portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive,
\par now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe,
\par by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The
\par power to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already
\par somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of Germany it
\par is stronger than in Central Germany, it is considerably stronger in
\par England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and
\par with hard skulls in the latter--not to mention Italy, which is too young
\par yet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can exercise
\par will, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense
\par middle empire where Europe as it were flows back to Asia--namely, in
\par Russia There the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated,
\par there the will--uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative--waits
\par threateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our
\par physicists) Perhaps not only Indian wars and complications in Asia would
\par be necessary to free Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal
\par subversion, the shattering of the empire into small states, and above
\par all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the
\par obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not
\par say this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather prefer the
\par contrary--I mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of
\par Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally
\par threatening--namely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to
\par rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that
\par can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out
\par comedy of its petty-statism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic
\par many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. The time for
\par petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the
\par dominion of the world--the COMPULSION to great politics.
\par 
\par 209. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have
\par evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger
\par kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily
\par merely by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already
\par understand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers
\par (who, as King of Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical
\par genius--and therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged
\par type of German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great,
\par had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew
\par what was then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times
\par more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form--his
\par ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound
\par instinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret,
\par that his own son was not man enough. There, however, he deceived
\par himself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place? He saw
\par his son lapsed to atheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of
\par clever Frenchmen--he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the
\par spider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no
\par longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no
\par longer commands, is no longer ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however,
\par there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous
\par skepticism--who knows TO WHAT EXTENT it was encouraged just by
\par his father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to
\par solitude?--the skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely related
\par to the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into
\par Germany in the person of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises
\par and nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does
\par not believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a
\par dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart. It is the
\par GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued Fredericianism, risen
\par to the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a considerable time
\par under the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historical
\par distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character
\par of the great German philologists and historical critics (who,
\par rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction
\par and dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually
\par established itself--in spite of all Romanticism in music and
\par philosophy--in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was
\par decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as
\par courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to
\par dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions
\par under barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it when
\par warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this
\par spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet
\par calls it, not without a shudder. But if one would realize how
\par characteristic is this fear of the "man" in the German spirit which
\par awakened Europe out of its "dogmatic slumber," let us call to mind the
\par former conception which had to be overcome by this new one--and that
\par it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with
\par unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of
\par Europe as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools.
\par Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough Napoleon's
\par astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for
\par centuries as the "German spirit" "VOILA UN HOMME!"--that was as much as
\par to say "But this is a MAN! And I only expected to see a German!"
\par 
\par 210. Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the
\par future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps
\par be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be
\par designated thereby--and not they themselves. With equal right they might
\par call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments.
\par By the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have already
\par expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is
\par this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use
\par of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense? In
\par their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and
\par painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic
\par century can approve of?--There is no doubt these coming ones will be
\par least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities
\par which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to
\par standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method,
\par the wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for
\par self-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT
\par in denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows
\par how to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds
\par They will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only)
\par than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the "truth" in
\par order that it may "please" them, or "elevate" and "inspire" them--they
\par will rather have little faith in "TRUTH" bringing with it such revels
\par for the feelings. They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one
\par says in their presence "That thought elevates me, why should it not be
\par true?" or "That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?" or
\par "That artist enlarges me, why should he not be great?" Perhaps they
\par will not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus
\par rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one
\par could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein
\par the intention to reconcile "Christian sentiments" with "antique taste,"
\par or even with "modern parliamentarism" (the kind of reconciliation
\par necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and
\par consequently very conciliatory century). Critical discipline, and every
\par habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters,
\par will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of
\par the future, they may even make a display thereof as their special
\par adornment--nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that
\par account. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to
\par have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that "philosophy itself is
\par criticism and critical science--and nothing else whatever!" Though this
\par estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of
\par France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste
\par of KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new
\par philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of
\par the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are
\par far from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman of
\par Konigsberg was only a great critic.
\par 
\par 211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding
\par philosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with
\par philosophers--that precisely here one should strictly give "each his
\par own," and not give those far too much, these far too little. It may
\par be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself
\par should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants,
\par the scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and MUST remain
\par standing he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist,
\par and historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and
\par riddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and "free spirit," and almost
\par everything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values
\par and estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and
\par consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up
\par to any height, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only
\par preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something
\par else--it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers, after
\par the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize some
\par great existing body of valuations--that is to say, former DETERMINATIONS
\par OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for
\par a time called "truths"--whether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the
\par POLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators to
\par make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous,
\par conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long,
\par even "time" itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense and
\par wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined pride, all
\par tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS,
\par HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: "Thus SHALL it be!"
\par They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby
\par set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all
\par subjugators of the past--they grasp at the future with a creative
\par hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an
\par instrument, and a hammer. Their "knowing" is CREATING, their creating
\par is a law-giving, their will to truth is--WILL TO POWER.--Are there at
\par present such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers? MUST
\par there not be such philosophers some day? ...
\par 
\par 212. It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man
\par INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever
\par found himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction
\par to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his
\par day. Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one
\par calls philosophers--who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom,
\par but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators--have found
\par their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end,
\par however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of
\par their age. In putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very
\par VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been
\par for the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to
\par his aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy,
\par indolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was
\par concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how
\par much virtue was OUTLIVED, they have always said "We must remove hence to
\par where YOU are least at home" In the face of a world of "modern ideas,"
\par which would like to confine every one in a corner, in a "specialty," a
\par philosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled
\par to place the greatness of man, the conception of "greatness," precisely
\par in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he
\par would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety
\par of that which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the
\par EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the
\par taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is
\par so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in
\par the ideal of the philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity
\par for prolonged resolution, must specially be included in the conception
\par of "greatness", with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its
\par ideal of a silly, renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to
\par an opposite age--such as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its
\par accumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods
\par of selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of worn-out
\par instincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves go--"for the
\par sake of happiness," as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their
\par conduct indicated--and who had continually on their lips the old pompous
\par words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led,
\par IRONY was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic
\par assurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his
\par own flesh, as into the flesh and heart of the "noble," with a look that
\par said plainly enough "Do not dissemble before me! here--we are equal!"
\par At present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-animal
\par alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when "equality of
\par right" can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong--I mean to
\par say into general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged,
\par against the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher
\par responsibility, the creative plenipotence and lordliness--at present
\par it belongs to the conception of "greatness" to be noble, to wish to be
\par apart, to be capable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live
\par by personal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his
\par own ideal when he asserts "He shall be the greatest who can be the most
\par solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good
\par and evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will;
\par precisely this shall be called GREATNESS: as diversified as can be
\par entire, as ample as can be full." And to ask once more the question: Is
\par greatness POSSIBLE--nowadays?
\par 
\par 213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot
\par be taught: one must "know" it by experience--or one should have the
\par pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things
\par of which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially
\par and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical
\par matters:--the very few know them, are permitted to know them, and
\par all popular ideas about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly
\par philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs
\par at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no
\par false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own
\par experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their
\par presence, it is incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as
\par troublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint;
\par thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating,
\par almost as a trouble, and often enough as "worthy of the SWEAT of the
\par noble"--but not at all as something easy and divine, closely related
\par to dancing and exuberance! "To think" and to take a matter "seriously,"
\par "arduously"--that is one and the same thing to them; such only has been
\par their "experience."--Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they
\par who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything
\par "arbitrarily," and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom,
\par of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping,
\par reaches its climax--in short, that necessity and "freedom of will" are
\par then the same thing with them. There is, in fine, a gradation of rank
\par in psychical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems
\par corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who
\par ventures too near them, without being predestined for their solution
\par by the loftiness and power of his spirituality. Of what use is it for
\par nimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists
\par to press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as
\par it were into this "holy of holies"--as so often happens nowadays! But
\par coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in
\par the primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intruders,
\par though they may dash and break their heads thereon. People have always
\par to be born to a high station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED
\par for it: a person has only a right to philosophy--taking the word in
\par its higher significance--in virtue of his descent; the ancestors, the
\par "blood," decide here also. Many generations must have prepared the way
\par for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been
\par separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the
\par bold, easy, delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all
\par the readiness for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance
\par and contemning look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with
\par their duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever
\par is misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and
\par practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of
\par will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely
\par loves....
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER VII. OUR VIRTUES
\par 
\par 
\par 214. OUR Virtues?--It is probable that we, too, have still our virtues,
\par although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on
\par account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a little
\par distance from us. We Europeans of the day after tomorrow, we firstlings
\par of the twentieth century--with all our dangerous curiosity, our
\par multifariousness and art of disguising, our mellow and seemingly
\par sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit--we shall presumably, IF we must
\par have virtues, have those only which have come to agreement with our most
\par secret and heartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent requirements:
\par well, then, let us look for them in our labyrinths!--where, as we know,
\par so many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost! And is
\par there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own virtues? Is it not
\par almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues? But this "believing in one's
\par own virtues"--is it not practically the same as what was formerly called
\par one's "good conscience," that long, respectable pigtail of an idea,
\par which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough
\par also behind their understandings? It seems, therefore, that however
\par little we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly
\par respectable in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless the
\par worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans with good
\par consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.--Ah! if you only knew how
\par soon, so very soon--it will be different!
\par 
\par 215. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which
\par determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different
\par colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with
\par green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley
\par colours: so we modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our
\par "firmament," are determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine
\par alternately in different colours, and are seldom unequivocal--and there
\par are often cases, also, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.
\par 
\par 216. To love one's enemies? I think that has been well learnt: it takes
\par place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed,
\par at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:--we learn to DESPISE
\par when we love, and precisely when we love best; all of it, however,
\par unconsciously, without noise, without ostentation, with the shame and
\par secrecy of goodness, which forbids the utterance of the pompous word
\par and the formula of virtue. Morality as attitude--is opposed to our taste
\par nowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our fathers
\par that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste,
\par including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion (and all
\par that formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime). It is the music in our
\par conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral
\par sermons, and goody-goodness won't chime.
\par 
\par 217. Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance
\par to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment!
\par They never forgive us if they have once made a mistake BEFORE us
\par (or even with REGARD to us)--they inevitably become our instinctive
\par calumniators and detractors, even when they still remain our
\par "friends."--Blessed are the forgetful: for they "get the better" even of
\par their blunders.
\par 
\par 218. The psychologists of France--and where else are there still
\par psychologists nowadays?--have never yet exhausted their bitter and
\par manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as though... in
\par short, they betray something thereby. Flaubert, for instance, the honest
\par citizen of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the
\par end; it was his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. As this is
\par growing wearisome, I would now recommend for a change something else
\par for a pleasure--namely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat,
\par honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks
\par they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which
\par is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the
\par middle-class in its best moments--subtler even than the understanding of
\par its victims:--a repeated proof that "instinct" is the most intelligent
\par of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered. In
\par short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the "rule" in its
\par struggle with the "exception": there you have a spectacle fit for Gods
\par and godlike malignity! Or, in plainer words, practise vivisection on
\par "good people," on the "homo bonae voluntatis," ON YOURSELVES!
\par 
\par 219. The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite
\par revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is
\par also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature,
\par and finally, it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING
\par subtle--malice spiritualises. They are glad in their inmost heart that
\par there is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed with
\par intellectual goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for
\par the "equality of all before God," and almost NEED the belief in God for
\par this purpose. It is among them that the most powerful antagonists of
\par atheism are found. If any one were to say to them "A lofty spirituality
\par is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely
\par moral man"--it would make them furious, I shall take care not to say
\par so. I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality
\par itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities, that it
\par is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the "merely moral" man,
\par after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice,
\par perhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty spirituality
\par is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity
\par which knows that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the
\par world, even among things--and not only among men.
\par 
\par 220. Now that the praise of the "disinterested person" is so popular
\par one must--probably not without some danger--get an idea of WHAT people
\par actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally which
\par fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men--including the
\par cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if
\par appearances do not deceive. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the
\par greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more
\par refined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely "uninteresting" to
\par the average man--if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these
\par interests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to
\par act "disinterestedly." There have been philosophers who could give this
\par popular astonishment a seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression
\par (perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience?),
\par instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that
\par "disinterested" action is very interesting and "interested" action,
\par provided that... "And love?"--What! Even an action for love's sake
\par shall be "unegoistic"? But you fools--! "And the praise of the
\par self-sacrificer?"--But whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that
\par he wanted and obtained something for it--perhaps something from himself
\par for something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to have
\par more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even feel himself "more."
\par But this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious
\par spirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle her yawns so
\par much when she is obliged to answer. And after all, truth is a woman; one
\par must not use force with her.
\par 
\par 221. "It sometimes happens," said a moralistic pedant and
\par trifle-retailer, "that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not,
\par however, because he is unselfish, but because I think he has a right to
\par be useful to another man at his own expense. In short, the question
\par is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER is. For instance, in a person
\par created and destined for command, self-denial and modest retirement,
\par instead of being virtues, would be the waste of virtues: so it seems
\par to me. Every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself
\par unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins against good
\par taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL
\par seduction under the mask of philanthropy--and precisely a seduction and
\par injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men. Moral
\par systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF
\par RANK; their presumption must be driven home to their conscience--until
\par they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that 'what
\par is right for one is proper for another.'"--So said my moralistic pedant
\par and bonhomme. Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus
\par exhorted systems of morals to practise morality? But one should not be
\par too much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on ONE'S OWN
\par side; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste.
\par 
\par 222. Wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays--and,
\par if I gather rightly, no other religion is any longer preached--let the
\par psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity, through all the
\par noise which is natural to these preachers (as to all preachers), he will
\par hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine note of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongs
\par to the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe, which has been on
\par the increase for a century (the first symptoms of which are already
\par specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame
\par d'Epinay)--IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF! The man of
\par "modern ideas," the conceited ape, is excessively dissatisfied with
\par himself--this is perfectly certain. He suffers, and his vanity wants him
\par only "to suffer with his fellows."
\par 
\par 223. The hybrid European--a tolerably ugly plebeian, taken all in
\par all--absolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroom
\par of costumes. To be sure, he notices that none of the costumes fit him
\par properly--he changes and changes. Let us look at the nineteenth century
\par with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades
\par of style, and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account
\par of "nothing suiting" us. It is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic,
\par or classical, or Christian, or Florentine, or barocco, or "national,"
\par in moribus et artibus: it does not "clothe us"! But the "spirit,"
\par especially the "historical spirit," profits even by this desperation:
\par once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested,
\par put on, taken off, packed up, and above all studied--we are the first
\par studious age in puncto of "costumes," I mean as concerns morals,
\par articles of belief, artistic tastes, and religions; we are prepared as
\par no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style, for the
\par most spiritual festival--laughter and arrogance, for the transcendental
\par height of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhaps
\par we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here, the
\par domain where even we can still be original, probably as parodists of
\par the world's history and as God's Merry-Andrews,--perhaps, though nothing
\par else of the present have a future, our laughter itself may have a
\par future!
\par 
\par 224. The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly
\par the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people, a
\par community, or an individual has lived, the "divining instinct" for the
\par relationships of these valuations, for the relation of the authority
\par of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces),--this
\par historical sense, which we Europeans claim as our specialty, has come
\par to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into which
\par Europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and
\par races--it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this
\par faculty as its sixth sense. Owing to this mingling, the past of every
\par form and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely
\par contiguous and superimposed on one another, flows forth into us "modern
\par souls"; our instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are
\par a kind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives its
\par advantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desire,
\par we have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age never had; we have
\par access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations, and to
\par every form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; and
\par in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto
\par has just been semi-barbarity, the "historical sense" implies almost the
\par sense and instinct for everything, the taste and tongue for everything:
\par whereby it immediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. For
\par instance, we enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest
\par acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer, whom men of
\par distinguished culture (as the French of the seventeenth century, like
\par Saint-Evremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and even
\par Voltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so easily
\par appropriate--whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. The very
\par decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their promptly ready disgust, their
\par hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange, their horror of
\par the bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the averseness of
\par every distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire,
\par a dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what is
\par strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards
\par the best things of the world which are not their property or could not
\par become their prey--and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men
\par than just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian
\par curiosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous
\par Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian
\par of the circle of AEschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter
\par or irritation: but we--accept precisely this wild motleyness, this
\par medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial,
\par with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement
\par of art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little
\par disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English
\par populace in which Shakespeare's art and taste lives, as perhaps on
\par the Chiaja of Naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way,
\par enchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of the lower
\par quarters of the town. That as men of the "historical sense" we have
\par our virtues, is not to be disputed:--we are unpretentious, unselfish,
\par modest, brave, habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very
\par grateful, very patient, very complaisant--but with all this we are
\par perhaps not very "tasteful." Let us finally confess it, that what is
\par most difficult for us men of the "historical sense" to grasp, feel,
\par taste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost
\par hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every
\par culture and art, the essentially noble in works and men, their moment
\par of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness
\par which all things show that have perfected themselves. Perhaps our great
\par virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste,
\par at least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves
\par imperfectly, hesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and
\par happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and
\par there: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has
\par voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite,--when a
\par super-abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking
\par and petrifying, by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still
\par trembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us, let us confess it
\par to ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite, the
\par immeasurable. Like the rider on his forward panting horse, we let the
\par reins fall before the infinite, we modern men, we semi-barbarians--and
\par are only in OUR highest bliss when we--ARE IN MOST DANGER.
\par 
\par 225. Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism,
\par all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according
\par to PLEASURE and PAIN, that is, according to accompanying circumstances
\par and secondary considerations, are plausible modes of thought and
\par naivetes, which every one conscious of CREATIVE powers and an artist's
\par conscience will look down upon with scorn, though not without sympathy.
\par Sympathy for you!--to be sure, that is not sympathy as you understand
\par it: it is not sympathy for social "distress," for "society" with its
\par sick and misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie
\par on the ground around us; still less is it sympathy for the grumbling,
\par vexed, revolutionary slave-classes who strive after power--they call it
\par "freedom." OUR sympathy is a loftier and further-sighted sympathy:--we
\par see how MAN dwarfs himself, how YOU dwarf him! and there are moments
\par when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish, when we resist
\par it,--when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind
\par of levity. You want, if possible--and there is not a more foolish "if
\par possible"--TO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we?--it really seems that WE
\par would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been!
\par Well-being, as you understand it--is certainly not a goal; it seems
\par to us an END; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and
\par contemptible--and makes his destruction DESIRABLE! The discipline
\par of suffering, of GREAT suffering--know ye not that it is only THIS
\par discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto?
\par The tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy,
\par its shuddering in view of rack and ruin, its inventiveness and bravery
\par in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and
\par whatever depth, mystery, disguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has
\par been bestowed upon the soul--has it not been bestowed through suffering,
\par through the discipline of great suffering? In man CREATURE and CREATOR
\par are united: in man there is not only matter, shred, excess, clay, mire,
\par folly, chaos; but there is also the creator, the sculptor, the hardness
\par of the hammer, the divinity of the spectator, and the seventh day--do
\par ye understand this contrast? And that YOUR sympathy for the "creature
\par in man" applies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged,
\par stretched, roasted, annealed, refined--to that which must necessarily
\par SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer? And our sympathy--do ye not understand
\par what our REVERSE sympathy applies to, when it resists your sympathy as
\par the worst of all pampering and enervation?--So it is sympathy AGAINST
\par sympathy!--But to repeat it once more, there are higher problems than
\par the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems of
\par philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes.
\par 
\par 226. WE IMMORALISTS.--This world with which WE are concerned, in which
\par we have to fear and love, this almost invisible, inaudible world of
\par delicate command and delicate obedience, a world of "almost" in every
\par respect, captious, insidious, sharp, and tender--yes, it is well
\par protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity! We are
\par woven into a strong net and garment of duties, and CANNOT disengage
\par ourselves--precisely here, we are "men of duty," even we! Occasionally,
\par it is true, we dance in our "chains" and betwixt our "swords"; it
\par is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the
\par circumstances, and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot. But
\par do what we will, fools and appearances say of us: "These are men WITHOUT
\par duty,"--we have always fools and appearances against us!
\par 
\par 227. Honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid
\par ourselves, we free spirits--well, we will labour at it with all our
\par perversity and love, and not tire of "perfecting" ourselves in OUR
\par virtue, which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread like
\par a gilded, blue, mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull
\par gloomy seriousness! And if, nevertheless, our honesty should one day
\par grow weary, and sigh, and stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and
\par would fain have it pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable
\par vice, let us remain HARD, we latest Stoics, and let us send to its
\par help whatever devilry we have in us:--our disgust at the clumsy
\par and undefined, our "NITIMUR IN VETITUM," our love of adventure,
\par our sharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised,
\par intellectual Will to Power and universal conquest, which rambles and
\par roves avidiously around all the realms of the future--let us go with all
\par our "devils" to the help of our "God"! It is probable that people will
\par misunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it matter! They
\par will say: "Their 'honesty'--that is their devilry, and nothing else!"
\par What does it matter! And even if they were right--have not all Gods
\par hitherto been such sanctified, re-baptized devils? And after all, what
\par do we know of ourselves? And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BE
\par CALLED? (It is a question of names.) And how many spirits we harbour?
\par Our honesty, we free spirits--let us be careful lest it become our
\par vanity, our ornament and ostentation, our limitation, our stupidity!
\par Every virtue inclines to stupidity, every stupidity to virtue; "stupid
\par to the point of sanctity," they say in Russia,--let us be careful lest
\par out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores! Is not life
\par a hundred times too short for us--to bore ourselves? One would have to
\par believe in eternal life in order to...
\par 
\par 228. I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy
\par hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific
\par appliances--and that "virtue," in my opinion, has been MORE injured
\par by the TEDIOUSNESS of its advocates than by anything else; at the same
\par time, however, I would not wish to overlook their general usefulness. It
\par is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals,
\par and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day
\par become interesting! But let us not be afraid! Things still remain today
\par as they have always been: I see no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES)
\par an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be
\par conducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring manner--that CALAMITY
\par might be involved therein. Observe, for example, the indefatigable,
\par inevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they
\par stalk on, stalk along (a Homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the
\par footsteps of Bentham, just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of
\par the respectable Helvetius! (no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius,
\par CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE, to use an expression of Galiani). No new
\par thought, nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression
\par of an old thought, not even a proper history of what has been previously
\par thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature, taking it all in all,
\par unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. In effect, the
\par old English vice called CANT, which is MORAL TARTUFFISM, has insinuated
\par itself also into these moralists (whom one must certainly read with an
\par eye to their motives if one MUST read them), concealed this time under
\par the new form of the scientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent
\par from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a
\par race of former Puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific
\par tinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan?
\par That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable,
\par as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem? Is moralizing
\par not-immoral?) In the end, they all want English morality to be
\par recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the "general
\par utility," or "the happiness of the greatest number,"--no! the happiness
\par of ENGLAND, will be best served thereby. They would like, by all means,
\par to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness, I
\par mean after COMFORT and FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in
\par Parliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that
\par in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has
\par just consisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous,
\par conscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the
\par cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have
\par any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the "general welfare" is
\par no ideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a
\par nostrum,--that what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another,
\par that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to
\par higher men, in short, that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man
\par and man, and consequently between morality and morality. They are an
\par unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian
\par Englishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one
\par cannot think highly enough of their utility. One ought even to ENCOURAGE
\par them, as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes:--
\par 
\par     Hail, ye worthies, barrow-wheeling,
\par     "Longer--better," aye revealing,
\par 
\par     Stiffer aye in head and knee;
\par     Unenraptured, never jesting,
\par     Mediocre everlasting,
\par 
\par     SANS GENIE ET SANS ESPRIT!
\par 
\par 
\par 229. In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity, there
\par still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the fear, of the
\par "cruel wild beast," the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of
\par these humaner ages--that even obvious truths, as if by the agreement
\par of centuries, have long remained unuttered, because they have the
\par appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again.
\par I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape; let
\par others capture it again and give it so much "milk of pious sentiment"
\par [FOOTNOTE: An expression from Schiller's William Tell, Act IV, Scene
\par 3.] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old
\par corner.--One ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open one's eyes;
\par one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that such immodest
\par gross errors--as, for instance, have been fostered by ancient and
\par modern philosophers with regard to tragedy--may no longer wander about
\par virtuously and boldly. Almost everything that we call "higher culture"
\par is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTY--this is
\par my thesis; the "wild beast" has not been slain at all, it lives, it
\par flourishes, it has only been--transfigured. That which constitutes the
\par painful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in
\par so-called tragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime,
\par up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its
\par sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. What the
\par Roman enjoys in the arena, the Christian in the ecstasies of the cross,
\par the Spaniard at the sight of the faggot and stake, or of the bull-fight,
\par the present-day Japanese who presses his way to the tragedy, the workman
\par of the Parisian suburbs who has a homesickness for bloody revolutions,
\par the Wagnerienne who, with unhinged will, "undergoes" the performance of
\par "Tristan and Isolde"--what all these enjoy, and strive with mysterious
\par ardour to drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe "cruelty." Here,
\par to be sure, we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of
\par former times, which could only teach with regard to cruelty that
\par it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is an
\par abundant, super-abundant enjoyment even in one's own suffering, in
\par causing one's own suffering--and wherever man has allowed himself to be
\par persuaded to self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation,
\par as among the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to
\par desensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical
\par repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal-like
\par SACRIFIZIA DELL' INTELLETO, he is secretly allured and impelled
\par forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS
\par HIMSELF.--Finally, let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge
\par operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he compels his
\par spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often enough against
\par the wishes of his heart:--he forces it to say Nay, where he would like
\par to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing
\par profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional injuring
\par of the fundamental will of the spirit, which instinctively aims at
\par appearance and superficiality,--even in every desire for knowledge there
\par is a drop of cruelty.
\par 
\par 230. Perhaps what I have said here about a "fundamental will of the
\par spirit" may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed
\par a word of explanation.--That imperious something which is popularly
\par called "the spirit," wishes to be master internally and externally,
\par and to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a
\par simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will.
\par Its requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by
\par physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. The power
\par of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong
\par tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold,
\par to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it
\par arbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself
\par certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of
\par the "outside world." Its object thereby is the incorporation of new
\par "experiences," the assortment of new things in the old arrangements--in
\par short, growth; or more properly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of
\par increased power--is its object. This same will has at its service an
\par apparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference
\par of ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner
\par denial of this or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive
\par attitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity,
\par with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance:
\par as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its
\par appropriating power, its "digestive power," to speak figuratively (and
\par in fact "the spirit" resembles a stomach more than anything else). Here
\par also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be
\par deceived (perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so,
\par but is only allowed to pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and
\par ambiguity, an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness
\par and mystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified,
\par the diminished, the misshapen, the beautified--an enjoyment of the
\par arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally, in this
\par connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to
\par deceive other spirits and dissemble before them--the constant pressing
\par and straining of a creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit
\par enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys
\par also its feeling of security therein--it is precisely by its Protean
\par arts that it is best protected and concealed!--COUNTER TO this
\par propensity for appearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a
\par cloak, in short, for an outside--for every outside is a cloak--there
\par operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and
\par INSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a
\par kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste, which every
\par courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought
\par to be, that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for
\par introspection, and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe
\par words. He will say: "There is something cruel in the tendency of my
\par spirit": let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not
\par so! In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps
\par our "extravagant honesty" were talked about, whispered about, and
\par glorified--we free, VERY free spirits--and some day perhaps SUCH will
\par actually be our--posthumous glory! Meanwhile--for there is plenty of
\par time until then--we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in
\par such florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has
\par just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance. They are
\par beautiful, glistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth,
\par love of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthful--there
\par is something in them that makes one's heart swell with pride. But we
\par anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the
\par secrecy of an anchorite's conscience, that this worthy parade of
\par verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment, frippery, and
\par gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even under such
\par flattering colour and repainting, the terrible original text HOMO NATURA
\par must again be recognized. In effect, to translate man back again into
\par nature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and
\par subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over
\par the eternal original text, HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shall
\par henceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline
\par of science, stands before the OTHER forms of nature, with fearless
\par Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old
\par metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far too long: "Thou
\par art more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!"--this may be
\par a strange and foolish task, but that it is a TASK, who can deny! Why did
\par we choose it, this foolish task? Or, to put the question differently:
\par "Why knowledge at all?" Every one will ask us about this. And thus
\par pressed, we, who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times, have
\par not found and cannot find any better answer....
\par 
\par 231. Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not
\par merely "conserve"--as the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of our
\par souls, quite "down below," there is certainly something unteachable,
\par a granite of spiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to
\par predetermined, chosen questions. In each cardinal problem there speaks
\par an unchangeable "I am this"; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and
\par woman, for instance, but can only learn fully--he can only follow to the
\par end what is "fixed" about them in himself. Occasionally we find certain
\par solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they
\par are henceforth called "convictions." Later on--one sees in them only
\par footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we
\par ourselves ARE--or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody,
\par our spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in us, quite "down below."--In view
\par of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself, permission
\par will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about
\par "woman as she is," provided that it is known at the outset how literally
\par they are merely--MY truths.
\par 
\par 232. Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to
\par enlighten men about "woman as she is"--THIS is one of the worst
\par developments of the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must these
\par clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure bring
\par to light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is so
\par much pedantry, superficiality, schoolmasterliness, petty presumption,
\par unbridledness, and indiscretion concealed--study only woman's behaviour
\par towards children!--which has really been best restrained and dominated
\par hitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas, if ever the "eternally tedious in
\par woman"--she has plenty of it!--is allowed to venture forth! if she
\par begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-of
\par charming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of alleviating and
\par taking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable
\par desires! Female voices are already raised, which, by Saint Aristophanes!
\par make one afraid:--with medical explicitness it is stated in a
\par threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man. Is
\par it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be
\par scientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's affair,
\par men's gift--we remained therewith "among ourselves"; and in the end,
\par in view of all that women write about "woman," we may well have
\par considerable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment
\par about herself--and CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new
\par ORNAMENT for herself--I believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally
\par feminine?--why, then, she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps she
\par thereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truth--what
\par does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign,
\par more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth--her great art is
\par falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess
\par it, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in
\par woman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the
\par company of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our
\par seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to
\par us. Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge
\par profundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart? And is it
\par not true that on the whole "woman" has hitherto been most despised by
\par woman herself, and not at all by us?--We men desire that woman should
\par not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was
\par man's care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed:
\par mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleon
\par gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in
\par politicis!--and in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls
\par out to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel.
\par 
\par 233. It betrays corruption of the instincts--apart from the fact that
\par it betrays bad taste--when a woman refers to Madame Roland, or Madame de
\par Stael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something were proved thereby
\par in favour of "woman as she is." Among men, these are the three comical
\par women as they are--nothing more!--and just the best involuntary
\par counter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy.
\par 
\par 234. Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible
\par thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of
\par the house is managed! Woman does not understand what food means, and she
\par insists on being cook! If woman had been a thinking creature, she should
\par certainly, as cook for thousands of years, have discovered the most
\par important physiological facts, and should likewise have got possession
\par of the healing art! Through bad female cooks--through the entire lack
\par of reason in the kitchen--the development of mankind has been longest
\par retarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very little
\par better. A word to High School girls.
\par 
\par 235. There are turns and casts of fancy, there are sentences, little
\par handfuls of words, in which a whole culture, a whole society suddenly
\par crystallises itself. Among these is the incidental remark of Madame de
\par Lambert to her son: "MON AMI, NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES,
\par QUI VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIR"--the motherliest and wisest remark, by
\par the way, that was ever addressed to a son.
\par 
\par 236. I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and
\par Goethe believed about woman--the former when he sang, "ELLA GUARDAVA
\par SUSO, ED IO IN LEI," and the latter when he interpreted it, "the
\par eternally feminine draws us ALOFT"; for THIS is just what she believes
\par of the eternally masculine.
\par 
\par 237.
\par 
\par SEVEN APOPHTHEGMS FOR WOMEN
\par 
\par How the longest ennui flees, When a man comes to our knees!
\par 
\par Age, alas! and science staid, Furnish even weak virtue aid.
\par 
\par Sombre garb and silence meet: Dress for every dame--discreet.
\par 
\par Whom I thank when in my bliss? God!--and my good tailoress!
\par 
\par Young, a flower-decked cavern home; Old, a dragon thence doth roam.
\par 
\par Noble title, leg that's fine, Man as well: Oh, were HE mine!
\par 
\par Speech in brief and sense in mass--Slippery for the jenny-ass!
\par 
\par 237A. Woman has hitherto been treated by men like birds, which, losing
\par their way, have come down among them from an elevation: as something
\par delicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating--but as something
\par also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away.
\par 
\par 238. To be mistaken in the fundamental problem of "man and woman," to
\par deny here the profoundest antagonism and the necessity for an eternally
\par hostile tension, to dream here perhaps of equal rights, equal
\par training, equal claims and obligations: that is a TYPICAL sign of
\par shallow-mindedness; and a thinker who has proved himself shallow at
\par this dangerous spot--shallow in instinct!--may generally be regarded as
\par suspicious, nay more, as betrayed, as discovered; he will probably prove
\par too "short" for all fundamental questions of life, future as well as
\par present, and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the
\par other hand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and
\par has also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and
\par harshness, and easily confounded with them, can only think of woman as
\par ORIENTALS do: he must conceive of her as a possession, as confinable
\par property, as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her
\par mission therein--he must take his stand in this matter upon the immense
\par rationality of Asia, upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia, as
\par the Greeks did formerly; those best heirs and scholars of Asia--who,
\par as is well known, with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power,
\par from Homer to the time of Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards
\par woman, in short, more Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW
\par humanely desirable this was, let us consider for ourselves!
\par 
\par 239. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so
\par much respect by men as at present--this belongs to the tendency and
\par fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to
\par old age--what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of
\par this respect? They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute
\par of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights,
\par indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is
\par losing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing
\par taste. She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who "unlearns to
\par fear" sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture
\par forward when the fear-inspiring quality in man--or more definitely,
\par the MAN in man--is no longer either desired or fully developed, is
\par reasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult
\par to understand is that precisely thereby--woman deteriorates. This is
\par what is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it!
\par Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military
\par and aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the economic and legal
\par independence of a clerk: "woman as clerkess" is inscribed on the portal
\par of the modern society which is in course of formation. While she
\par thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be "master," and inscribes
\par "progress" of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises
\par itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES. Since the French
\par Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportion
\par as she has increased her rights and claims; and the "emancipation of
\par woman," insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves (and
\par not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable
\par symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly
\par instincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine
\par stupidity, of which a well-reared woman--who is always a sensible
\par woman--might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the ground
\par upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in
\par the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps
\par even "to the book," where formerly she kept herself in control and in
\par refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man's
\par faith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something
\par eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously
\par dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for,
\par protected, and indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and
\par often pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of
\par everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of
\par woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still
\par entails (as though slavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a
\par condition of every higher culture, of every elevation of culture):--what
\par does all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts,
\par a defeminising? Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and
\par corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who
\par advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate
\par all the stupidities from which "man" in Europe, European "manliness,"
\par suffers,--who would like to lower woman to "general culture," indeed
\par even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here and there
\par they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: as
\par though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious
\par or ludicrous to a profound and godless man;--almost everywhere her
\par nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music
\par (our latest German music), and she is daily being made more hysterical
\par and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of
\par bearing robust children. They wish to "cultivate" her in general still
\par more, and intend, as they say, to make the "weaker sex" STRONG by
\par culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that
\par the "cultivating" of mankind and his weakening--that is to say, the
\par weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILL--have
\par always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and
\par influential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon)
\par had just to thank their force of will--and not their schoolmasters--for
\par their power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect
\par in woman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more
\par "natural" than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning
\par flexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism,
\par her untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness,
\par extent, and deviation of her desires and virtues. That which, in spite
\par of fear, excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat,
\par "woman," is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more
\par necessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any
\par other creature. Fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has
\par hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in
\par tragedy, which rends while it delights--What? And all that is now to
\par be at an end? And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The
\par tediousness of woman is slowly evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We know
\par the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee, from which
\par danger is ever again threatening thee! Thy old fable might once more
\par become "history"--an immense stupidity might once again overmaster
\par thee and carry thee away! And no God concealed beneath it--no! only an
\par "idea," a "modern idea"!
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par CHAPTER VIII. PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES
\par 
\par 
\par 240. I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner's overture
\par to the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy,
\par latter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music
\par as still living, in order that it may be understood:--it is an honour
\par to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavours
\par and forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It
\par impresses us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter,
\par and too modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it
\par is not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse--it has fire
\par and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits
\par which ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a
\par moment of inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause
\par and effect, an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but
\par already it broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight--the most
\par manifold delight,--of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY
\par the joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his
\par astonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here
\par employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art
\par which he apparently betrays to us. All in all, however, no beauty, no
\par South, nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing
\par of grace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even,
\par which is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us: "It
\par is part of my intention"; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily
\par barbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits
\par and witticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of
\par the word, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and
\par inexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude of
\par soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of
\par decadence--which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a real,
\par genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time young and
\par aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This kind of music
\par expresses best what I think of the Germans: they belong to the day
\par before yesterday and the day after tomorrow--THEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY.
\par 
\par 241. We "good Europeans," we also have hours when we allow ourselves a
\par warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow
\par views--I have just given an example of it--hours of national excitement,
\par of patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods of
\par sentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines
\par its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours--in a
\par considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime,
\par according to the speed and strength with which they digest and "change
\par their material." Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races,
\par which even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century
\par ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and
\par soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to
\par "good Europeanism." And while digressing on this possibility, I
\par happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two old
\par patriots--they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently
\par spoke all the louder. "HE has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as
\par a peasant or a corps-student," said the one--"he is still innocent. But
\par what does that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie on
\par their belly before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis.
\par A statesman who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity
\par of empire and power, they call 'great'--what does it matter that we more
\par prudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief
\par that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or
\par affair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position
\par of being obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they
\par were by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have
\par to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and
\par doubtful mediocrity;--supposing a statesman were to condemn his people
\par generally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something
\par better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls
\par they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of
\par the restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially
\par politics-practising nations;--supposing such a statesman were to
\par stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to
\par make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness,
\par an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to
\par depreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences,
\par make their minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'--what! a statesman
\par who should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for
\par throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman
\par would be GREAT, would he?"--"Undoubtedly!" replied the other old patriot
\par vehemently, "otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad perhaps to
\par wish such a thing! But perhaps everything great has been just as mad
\par at its commencement!"--"Misuse of words!" cried his interlocutor,
\par contradictorily--"strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!"--The old
\par men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their "truths" in
\par each other's faces, but I, in my happiness and apartness, considered how
\par soon a stronger one may become master of the strong, and also that
\par there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a
\par nation--namely, in the deepening of another.
\par 
\par 242. Whether we call it "civilization," or "humanising," or "progress,"
\par which now distinguishes the European, whether we call it simply, without
\par praise or blame, by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in
\par Europe--behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by
\par such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on, which is ever
\par extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans, their
\par increasing detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and
\par hereditarily, united races originate, their increasing independence of
\par every definite milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself
\par with equal demands on soul and body,--that is to say, the slow emergence
\par of an essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who
\par possesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power
\par of adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVING
\par EUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but
\par will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth--the
\par still-raging storm and stress of "national sentiment" pertains to it,
\par and also the anarchism which is appearing at present--this process
\par will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and
\par panegyrists, the apostles of "modern ideas," would least care to reckon.
\par The same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and
\par mediocrising of man will take place--a useful, industrious, variously
\par serviceable, and clever gregarious man--are in the highest degree
\par suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and
\par attractive qualities. For, while the capacity for adaptation, which is
\par every day trying changing conditions, and begins a new work with every
\par generation, almost with every decade, makes the POWERFULNESS of the type
\par impossible; while the collective impression of such future Europeans
\par will probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very
\par handy workmen who REQUIRE a master, a commander, as they require their
\par daily bread; while, therefore, the democratising of Europe will tend to
\par the production of a type prepared for SLAVERY in the most subtle
\par sense of the term: the STRONG man will necessarily in individual and
\par exceptional cases, become stronger and richer than he has perhaps ever
\par been before--owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to
\par the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise. I meant to say
\par that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntary
\par arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTS--taking the word in all its
\par meanings, even in its most spiritual sense.
\par 
\par 243. I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the
\par constellation Hercules: and I hope that the men on this earth will do
\par like the sun. And we foremost, we good Europeans!
\par 
\par 244. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans "deep"
\par by way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new
\par Germanism is covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses
\par "smartness" in all that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic
\par to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that
\par commendation: in short, whether German depth is not at bottom something
\par different and worse--and something from which, thank God, we are on the
\par point of successfully ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn
\par with regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is
\par a little vivisection of the German soul.--The German soul is above all
\par manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather
\par than actually built: this is owing to its origin. A German who would
\par embolden himself to assert: "Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast," would
\par make a bad guess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far
\par short of the truth about the number of souls. As a people made up of
\par the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a
\par preponderance of the pre-Aryan element as the "people of the centre" in
\par every sense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample,
\par more contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising,
\par and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:--they
\par escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the despair of the French. It
\par IS characteristic of the Germans that the question: "What is German?"
\par never dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well
\par enough: "We are known," they cried jubilantly to him--but Sand also
\par thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared
\par himself incensed at Fichte's lying but patriotic flatteries and
\par exaggerations,--but it is probable that Goethe thought differently about
\par Germans from Jean Paul, even though he acknowledged him to be right with
\par regard to Fichte. It is a question what Goethe really thought about the
\par Germans?--But about many things around him he never spoke explicitly,
\par and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence--probably he
\par had good reason for it. It is certain that it was not the "Wars of
\par Independence" that made him look up more joyfully, any more than it was
\par the French Revolution,--the event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED
\par his "Faust," and indeed the whole problem of "man," was the appearance
\par of Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in which he condemns with
\par impatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which Germans take a
\par pride in, he once defined the famous German turn of mind as "Indulgence
\par towards its own and others' weaknesses." Was he wrong? it is
\par characteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them.
\par The German soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves,
\par hiding-places, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm
\par of the mysterious, the German is well acquainted with the bypaths to
\par chaos. And as everything loves its symbol, so the German loves the
\par clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and
\par shrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain, undeveloped,
\par self-displacing, and growing is "deep". The German himself does not
\par EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is "developing himself". "Development" is
\par therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain
\par of philosophical formulas,--a ruling idea, which, together with German
\par beer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners
\par are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature
\par at the basis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which
\par Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music).
\par "Good-natured and spiteful"--such a juxtaposition, preposterous in the
\par case of every other people, is unfortunately only too often justified
\par in Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians to know this!
\par The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness
\par agree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimble
\par boldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any one
\par wishes to see the "German soul" demonstrated ad oculos, let him
\par only look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish
\par indifference to "taste"! How the noblest and the commonest stand there
\par in juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution
\par of this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he
\par experiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets "done"
\par with them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating
\par "digestion." And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what
\par is convenient, so the German loves "frankness" and "honesty"; it is
\par so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!--This confidingness, this
\par complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the
\par most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to
\par nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can "still
\par achieve much"! The German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with
\par faithful, blue, empty German eyes--and other countries immediately
\par confound him with his dressing-gown!--I meant to say that, let "German
\par depth" be what it will--among ourselves alone we perhaps take the
\par liberty to laugh at it--we shall do well to continue henceforth to
\par honour its appearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our
\par old reputation as a people of depth for Prussian "smartness," and
\par Berlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and LET itself
\par be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it
\par might even be--profound to do so! Finally, we should do honour to
\par our name--we are not called the "TIUSCHE VOLK" (deceptive people) for
\par nothing....
\par 
\par 245. The "good old" time is past, it sang itself out in Mozart--how
\par happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his "good
\par company," his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in the Chinese and
\par its flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the
\par amorous, the tripping, the tearful, and his belief in the South, can
\par still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in us! Ah, some time or other it will be
\par over with it!--but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with
\par the intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo
\par of a break and transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo
\par of a great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven
\par is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly
\par breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING;
\par there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal
\par extravagant hope,--the same light in which Europe was bathed when it
\par dreamed with Rousseau, when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the
\par Revolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon.
\par But how rapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult
\par nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does
\par the language of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear,
\par in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to SPEAK, which
\par knew how to SING in Beethoven!--Whatever German music came afterwards,
\par belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a movement which,
\par historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting, and more
\par superficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe from
\par Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. Weber--but what do
\par WE care nowadays for "Freischutz" and "Oberon"! Or Marschner's "Hans
\par Heiling" and "Vampyre"! Or even Wagner's "Tannhauser"! That is extinct,
\par although not yet forgotten music. This whole music of Romanticism,
\par besides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to maintain its
\par position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from the
\par beginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of by
\par genuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon
\par master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly
\par acquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful
\par EPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who took
\par things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first--he
\par was the last that founded a school,--do we not now regard it as a
\par satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism
\par of Schumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the "Saxon
\par Switzerland" of his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like
\par nature (assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)--his
\par MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of
\par injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY
\par taste (that is to say, a dangerous propensity--doubly dangerous among
\par Germans--for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going
\par constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who
\par revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning
\par a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE--this Schumann was already merely a
\par GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had
\par been, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German
\par music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE
\par FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.
\par 
\par 246. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has a
\par THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp
\par of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance, which Germans call
\par a "book"! And even the German who READS books! How lazily, how
\par reluctantly, how badly he reads! How many Germans know, and consider it
\par obligatory to know, that there is ART in every good sentence--art which
\par must be divined, if the sentence is to be understood! If there is a
\par misunderstanding about its TEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself
\par is misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about the
\par rhythm-determining syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the
\par too-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a
\par fine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should
\par divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how
\par delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of
\par their arrangement--who among book-reading Germans is complaisant enough
\par to recognize such duties and requirements, and to listen to so much art
\par and intention in language? After all, one just "has no ear for it";
\par and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard, and the most
\par delicate artistry is as it were SQUANDERED on the deaf.--These were my
\par thoughts when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in
\par the art of prose-writing have been confounded: one, whose words drop
\par down hesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cave--he counts
\par on their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his language
\par like a flexible sword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the
\par dangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to
\par bite, hiss, and cut.
\par 
\par 247. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with the
\par ear, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves
\par write badly. The German does not read aloud, he does not read for the
\par ear, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for
\par the time. In antiquity when a man read--which was seldom enough--he read
\par something to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when
\par any one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. In a
\par loud voice: that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and
\par variations of key and changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC
\par world took delight. The laws of the written style were then the same
\par as those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the
\par surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx;
\par partly on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. In
\par the ancient sense, a period is above all a physiological whole, inasmuch
\par as it is comprised in one breath. Such periods as occur in Demosthenes
\par and Cicero, swelling twice and sinking twice, and all in one breath,
\par were pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling
\par how to appreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty
\par in the deliverance of such a period;--WE have really no right to the
\par BIG period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every sense! Those
\par ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in speaking, consequently
\par connoisseurs, consequently critics--they thus brought their orators to
\par the highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all
\par Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song
\par (and with it also the art of melody) reached its elevation. In Germany,
\par however (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began
\par shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there was
\par properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical
\par discourse--that delivered from the pulpit. The preacher was the only one
\par in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a
\par sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone
\par had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons
\par are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom
\par attained by a German, or almost always too late. The masterpiece of
\par German prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its
\par greatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best German
\par book. Compared with Luther's Bible, almost everything else is merely
\par "literature"--something which has not grown in Germany, and therefore
\par has not taken and does not take root in German hearts, as the Bible has
\par done.
\par 
\par 248. There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders and
\par seeks to engender, and another which willingly lets itself be fructified
\par and brings forth. And similarly, among the gifted nations, there are
\par those on whom the woman's problem of pregnancy has devolved, and the
\par secret task of forming, maturing, and perfecting--the Greeks, for
\par instance, were a nation of this kind, and so are the French; and others
\par which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life--like
\par the Jews, the Romans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the
\par Germans?--nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and
\par irresistibly forced out of themselves, amorous and longing for
\par foreign races (for such as "let themselves be fructified"), and withal
\par imperious, like everything conscious of being full of generative force,
\par and consequently empowered "by the grace of God." These two kinds of
\par geniuses seek each other like man and woman; but they also misunderstand
\par each other--like man and woman.
\par 
\par 249. Every nation has its own "Tartuffery," and calls that its
\par virtue.--One does not know--cannot know, the best that is in one.
\par 
\par 250. What Europe owes to the Jews?--Many things, good and bad, and above
\par all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the grand
\par style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands, of
\par infinite significations, the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral
\par questionableness--and consequently just the most attractive, ensnaring,
\par and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life,
\par in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture, its evening
\par sky, now glows--perhaps glows out. For this, we artists among the
\par spectators and philosophers, are--grateful to the Jews.
\par 
\par 251. It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and
\par disturbances--in short, slight attacks of stupidity--pass over the
\par spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national
\par nervous fever and political ambition: for instance, among present-day
\par Germans there is alternately the anti-French folly, the anti-Semitic
\par folly, the anti-Polish folly, the Christian-romantic folly, the
\par Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic folly, the Prussian folly (just look at
\par those poor historians, the Sybels and Treitschkes, and their closely
\par bandaged heads), and whatever else these little obscurations of the
\par German spirit and conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me that
\par I, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground, did not
\par remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one else, began
\par to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me--the first
\par symptom of political infection. About the Jews, for instance, listen
\par to the following:--I have never yet met a German who was favourably
\par inclined to the Jews; and however decided the repudiation of actual
\par anti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men, this
\par prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the
\par sentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess, and especially
\par against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of
\par sentiment;--on this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germany
\par has amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the German blood,
\par has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only of this
\par quantity of "Jew"--as the Italian, the Frenchman, and the Englishman
\par have done by means of a stronger digestion:--that is the unmistakable
\par declaration and language of a general instinct, to which one must listen
\par and according to which one must act. "Let no more Jews come in! And shut
\par the doors, especially towards the East (also towards Austria)!"--thus
\par commands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and
\par uncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by
\par a stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest,
\par toughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they know how
\par to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than under
\par favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would like
\par nowadays to label as vices--owing above all to a resolute faith which
\par does not need to be ashamed before "modern ideas", they alter only,
\par WHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian Empire makes
\par its conquest--as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of
\par yesterday--namely, according to the principle, "as slowly as possible"!
\par A thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, will, in all his
\par perspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he
\par will calculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and likeliest
\par factors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at present
\par called a "nation" in Europe, and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA
\par (indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in
\par every case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet
\par a race, much less such a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such
\par "nations" should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry and
\par hostility! It is certain that the Jews, if they desired--or if they
\par were driven to it, as the anti-Semites seem to wish--COULD now have the
\par ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT
\par working and planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, they
\par rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and
\par absorbed by Europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and
\par respected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the
\par "wandering Jew",--and one should certainly take account of this impulse
\par and tendency, and MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation
\par of the Jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful
\par and fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country. One
\par should make advances with all prudence, and with selection, pretty much
\par as the English nobility do It stands to reason that the more powerful
\par and strongly marked types of new Germanism could enter into relation
\par with the Jews with the least hesitation, for instance, the nobleman
\par officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many ways
\par to see whether the genius for money and patience (and especially some
\par intellect and intellectuality--sadly lacking in the place referred to)
\par could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of
\par commanding and obeying--for both of which the country in question has
\par now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal
\par discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my
\par SERIOUS TOPIC, the "European problem," as I understand it, the rearing
\par of a new ruling caste for Europe.
\par 
\par 252. They are not a philosophical race--the English: Bacon represents an
\par ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally, Hobbes, Hume, and Locke,
\par an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a "philosopher" for more
\par than a century. It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself;
\par it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said, "JE MEPRISE LOCKE"; in the
\par struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world,
\par Hegel and Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the
\par two hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different
\par directions towards the opposite poles of German thought, and thereby
\par wronged each other as only brothers will do.--What is lacking in
\par England, and has always been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician
\par knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head, Carlyle, who sought to conceal
\par under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely, what was
\par LACKING in Carlyle--real POWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual
\par perception, in short, philosophy. It is characteristic of such an
\par unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianity--they NEED its
\par discipline for "moralizing" and humanizing. The Englishman, more gloomy,
\par sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the German--is for that very
\par reason, as the baser of the two, also the most pious: he has all the
\par MORE NEED of Christianity. To finer nostrils, this English Christianity
\par itself has still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic
\par excess, for which, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote--the
\par finer poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is
\par in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards
\par spiritualization. The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still
\par most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime, and by praying
\par and psalm-singing (or, more correctly, it is thereby explained and
\par differently expressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who
\par formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism (and
\par more recently as the "Salvation Army"), a penitential fit may really be
\par the relatively highest manifestation of "humanity" to which they can
\par be elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. That, however, which
\par offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music, to speak
\par figuratively (and also literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in
\par the movements of his soul and body; indeed, not even the desire for
\par rhythm and dance, for "music." Listen to him speaking; look at the most
\par beautiful Englishwoman WALKING--in no country on earth are there more
\par beautiful doves and swans; finally, listen to them singing! But I ask
\par too much...
\par 
\par 253. There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds,
\par because they are best adapted for them, there are truths which only
\par possess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits:--one is pushed
\par to this probably unpleasant conclusion, now that the influence of
\par respectable but mediocre Englishmen--I may mention Darwin, John
\par Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer--begins to gain the ascendancy in the
\par middle-class region of European taste. Indeed, who could doubt that it
\par is a useful thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time? It
\par would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently
\par soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many
\par little common facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions,
\par they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards
\par those who are "the rules." After all, they have more to do than merely
\par to perceive:--in effect, they have to BE something new, they have to
\par SIGNIFY something new, they have to REPRESENT new values! The gulf
\par between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater, and also more
\par mysterious, than one thinks: the capable man in the grand style, the
\par creator, will possibly have to be an ignorant person;--while on the
\par other hand, for scientific discoveries like those of Darwin, a certain
\par narrowness, aridity, and industrious carefulness (in short, something
\par English) may not be unfavourable for arriving at them.--Finally, let
\par it not be forgotten that the English, with their profound mediocrity,
\par brought about once before a general depression of European intelligence.
\par 
\par What is called "modern ideas," or "the ideas of the eighteenth century,"
\par or "French ideas"--that, consequently, against which the GERMAN mind
\par rose up with profound disgust--is of English origin, there is no doubt
\par about it. The French were only the apes and actors of these ideas, their
\par best soldiers, and likewise, alas! their first and profoundest VICTIMS;
\par for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of "modern ideas," the AME
\par FRANCAIS has in the end become so thin and emaciated, that at present
\par one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound,
\par passionate strength, its inventive excellency, almost with disbelief.
\par One must, however, maintain this verdict of historical justice in
\par a determined manner, and defend it against present prejudices and
\par appearances: the European NOBLESSE--of sentiment, taste, and manners,
\par taking the word in every high sense--is the work and invention of
\par FRANCE; the European ignobleness, the plebeianism of modern ideas--is
\par ENGLAND'S work and invention.
\par 
\par 254. Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual
\par and refined culture of Europe, it is still the high school of taste; but
\par one must know how to find this "France of taste." He who belongs to it
\par keeps himself well concealed:--they may be a small number in whom it
\par lives and is embodied, besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon
\par the strongest legs, in part fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in
\par part persons over-indulged, over-refined, such as have the AMBITION to
\par conceal themselves.
\par 
\par They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in
\par presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic
\par BOURGEOIS. In fact, a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawls
\par in the foreground--it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste,
\par and at the same time of self-admiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo.
\par There is also something else common to them: a predilection to resist
\par intellectual Germanizing--and a still greater inability to do so!
\par In this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism,
\par Schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than
\par he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine, who has
\par long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists
\par of Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the form of Taine--the FIRST
\par of living historians--exercises an almost tyrannical influence. As
\par regards Richard Wagner, however, the more French music learns to
\par adapt itself to the actual needs of the AME MODERNE, the more will it
\par "Wagnerite"; one can safely predict that beforehand,--it is already
\par taking place sufficiently! There are, however, three things which the
\par French can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession,
\par and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority
\par in Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and
\par vulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for
\par devotion to "form," for which the expression, L'ART POUR L'ART, along
\par with numerous others, has been invented:--such capacity has not been
\par lacking in France for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for
\par the "small number," it has again and again made a sort of chamber
\par music of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere
\par in Europe.--The SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to
\par a superiority over Europe is their ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC
\par culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty
\par ROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a
\par psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one
\par has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany.
\par The Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite
\par thereto, which, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who call
\par the Germans "naive" on that account give them commendation for a defect.
\par (As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE
\par PSYCHOLOGICA, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness
\par of German intercourse,--and as the most successful expression of
\par genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate
\par thrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and
\par forerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS Europe,
\par in fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a surveyor and
\par discoverer thereof:--it has required two generations to OVERTAKE him
\par one way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the riddles
\par that perplexed and enraptured him--this strange Epicurean and man of
\par interrogation, the last great psychologist of France).--There is yet
\par a THIRD claim to superiority: in the French character there is a
\par successful half-way synthesis of the North and South, which makes them
\par comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, which an
\par Englishman can never comprehend. Their temperament, turned alternately
\par to and from the South, in which from time to time the Provencal and
\par Ligurian blood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern
\par grey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of
\par blood--our GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence
\par of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that is to say "high
\par politics," has with great resolution been prescribed (according to
\par a dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet
\par hope).--There is also still in France a pre-understanding and
\par ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too
\par comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and
\par know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the
\par South--the born Midlanders, the "good Europeans." For them BIZET
\par has made music, this latest genius, who has seen a new beauty and
\par seduction,--who has discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.
\par 
\par 255. I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music.
\par Suppose a person loves the South as I love it--as a great school
\par of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a
\par boundless solar profusion and effulgence which o'erspreads a sovereign
\par existence believing in itself--well, such a person will learn to be
\par somewhat on his guard against German music, because, in injuring his
\par taste anew, it will also injure his health anew. Such a Southerner, a
\par Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future
\par of music, must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the
\par North; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and
\par perhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music, which
\par does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music does, at the
\par sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of sky--a
\par super-European music, which holds its own even in presence of the brown
\par sunsets of the desert, whose soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be
\par at home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey... I
\par could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew
\par nothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps some
\par sailor's home-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might
\par sweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would see
\par the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing
\par towards it, and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to
\par receive such belated fugitives.
\par 
\par 256. Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has
\par induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing also to the
\par short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this
\par craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the
\par disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude
\par policy--owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable
\par at present, the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE,
\par are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. With all
\par the more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real general
\par tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way
\par for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to anticipate the European of
\par the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in
\par old age perhaps, did they belong to the "fatherlands"--they only rested
\par from themselves when they became "patriots." I think of such men as
\par Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it
\par must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about
\par whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings
\par (geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves),
\par still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now
\par resisted and opposed in France: the fact remains, nevertheless, that
\par Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties, are
\par most closely and intimately related to one another. They are akin,
\par fundamentally akin, in all the heights and depths of their requirements;
\par it is Europe, the ONE Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly,
\par outwards and upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous art--whither?
\par into a new light? towards a new sun? But who would attempt to express
\par accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not
\par express distinctly? It is certain that the same storm and stress
\par tormented them, that they SOUGHT in the same manner, these last great
\par seekers! All of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears--the
\par first artists of universal literary culture--for the most part even
\par themselves writers, poets, intermediaries and blenders of the arts and
\par the senses (Wagner, as musician is reckoned among painters, as poet
\par among musicians, as artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics
\par for EXPRESSION "at any cost"--I specially mention Delacroix, the nearest
\par related to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of the
\par sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still greater discoverers
\par in effect, in display, in the art of the show-shop; all of them talented
\par far beyond their genius, out and out VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses
\par to all that seduces, allures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of
\par logic and of the straight line, hankering after the strange, the
\par exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men,
\par Tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to be
\par incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and action--think
\par of Balzac, for instance,--unrestrained workers, almost destroying
\par themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners, ambitious and
\par insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finally
\par shattering and sinking down at the Christian cross (and with right
\par and reason, for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and
\par sufficiently original for an ANTI-CHRISTIAN philosophy?);--on the
\par whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and
\par aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their
\par century--and it is the century of the MASSES--the conception "higher
\par man."... Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together as to
\par whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or whether
\par its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER-GERMAN
\par sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underrated
\par how indispensable Paris was to the development of his type, which the
\par strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most
\par decisive time--and how the whole style of his proceedings, of his
\par self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the French
\par socialistic original. On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be
\par found, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German nature, that he has
\par acted in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation
\par than a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done--owing to the
\par circumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the
\par French;--perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is
\par not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and
\par inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried,
\par that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too
\par cheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow
\par civilized nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this
\par anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old
\par sad days, when--anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into
\par politics--he began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to
\par preach, at least, THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.--That
\par these last words may not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few
\par powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I
\par mean--what I mean COUNTER TO the "last Wagner" and his Parsifal music:--
\par 
\par --Is this our mode?--From German heart came this vexed ululating? From
\par German body, this self-lacerating? Is ours this priestly hand-dilation,
\par This incense-fuming exaltation? Is ours this faltering, falling,
\par shambling, This quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling? This sly
\par nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly false enraptured
\par heaven-o'erspringing?--Is this our mode?--Think well!--ye still wait for

\par 
\par CHAPTER IX. WHAT IS NOBLE?
\par 
\par 
\par 257. EVERY elevation of the type "man," has hitherto been the work of an
\par aristocratic society and so it will always be--a society believing in
\par a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human
\par beings, and requiring slavery in some form or other. Without the PATHOS
\par OF DISTANCE, such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes,
\par out of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on
\par subordinates and instruments, and out of their equally constant
\par practice of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a
\par distance--that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen, the
\par longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself,
\par the formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more
\par comprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of the type "man,"
\par the continued "self-surmounting of man," to use a moral formula in
\par a supermoral sense. To be sure, one must not resign oneself to
\par any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an
\par aristocratic society (that is to say, of the preliminary condition for
\par the elevation of the type "man"): the truth is hard. Let us acknowledge
\par unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED!
\par Men with a still natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of
\par the word, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of will
\par and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more moral, more
\par peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities), or upon
\par old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering
\par out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. At the commencement,
\par the noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority did
\par not consist first of all in their physical, but in their psychical
\par power--they were more COMPLETE men (which at every point also implies
\par the same as "more complete beasts").
\par 
\par 258. Corruption--as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out
\par among the instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called
\par "life," is convulsed--is something radically different according to
\par the organization in which it manifests itself. When, for instance, an
\par aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution,
\par flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself
\par to an excess of its moral sentiments, it was corruption:--it was really
\par only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries,
\par by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its
\par lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in
\par the end even to its decoration and parade-dress). The essential thing,
\par however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard
\par itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but
\par as the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereof--that it should
\par therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion
\par of individuals, who, FOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to
\par imperfect men, to slaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must
\par be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but
\par only as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class
\par of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and
\par in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-seeking climbing plants
\par in Java--they are called Sipo Matador,--which encircle an oak so
\par long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but
\par supported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and
\par exhibit their happiness.
\par 
\par 259. To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation,
\par and put one's will on a par with that of others: this may result in a
\par certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary
\par conditions are given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals
\par in amount of force and degree of worth, and their co-relation within one
\par organization). As soon, however, as one wished to take this principle
\par more generally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF
\par SOCIETY, it would immediately disclose what it really is--namely, a Will
\par to the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and decay. Here one
\par must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental
\par weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest
\par of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of
\par peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest,
\par exploitation;--but why should one for ever use precisely these words
\par on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped? Even the
\par organization within which, as was previously supposed, the
\par individuals treat each other as equal--it takes place in every
\par healthy aristocracy--must itself, if it be a living and not a dying
\par organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the individuals
\par within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the
\par incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain ground,
\par attract to itself and acquire ascendancy--not owing to any morality or
\par immorality, but because it LIVES, and because life IS precisely Will to
\par Power. On no point, however, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans
\par more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave
\par everywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming conditions of
\par society in which "the exploiting character" is to be absent--that sounds
\par to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should
\par refrain from all organic functions. "Exploitation" does not belong to a
\par depraved, or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of
\par the living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence
\par of the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the Will to
\par Life--Granting that as a theory this is a novelty--as a reality it is
\par the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest towards
\par ourselves!
\par 
\par 260. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have
\par hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits
\par recurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until
\par finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical
\par distinction was brought to light. There is MASTER-MORALITY and
\par SLAVE-MORALITY,--I would at once add, however, that in all higher and
\par mixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of
\par the two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and
\par mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close
\par juxtaposition--even in the same man, within one soul. The distinctions
\par of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly
\par conscious of being different from the ruled--or among the ruled class,
\par the slaves and dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is
\par the rulers who determine the conception "good," it is the exalted, proud
\par disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that
\par which determines the order of rank. The noble type of man separates
\par from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud
\par disposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be noted
\par that in this first kind of morality the antithesis "good" and "bad"
\par means practically the same as "noble" and "despicable",--the antithesis
\par "good" and "EVIL" is of a different origin. The cowardly, the timid, the
\par insignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised;
\par moreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained glances, the
\par self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused,
\par the mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:--it is a fundamental
\par belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. "We
\par truthful ones"--the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves. It is
\par obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first
\par applied to MEN; and were only derivatively and at a later period applied
\par to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals
\par start with questions like, "Why have sympathetic actions been praised?"
\par The noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he
\par does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: "What is
\par injurious to me is injurious in itself;" he knows that it is he himself
\par only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He
\par honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals
\par self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude,
\par of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the
\par consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:--the noble
\par man also helps the unfortunate, but not--or scarcely--out of pity, but
\par rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The
\par noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power
\par over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who
\par takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has
\par reverence for all that is severe and hard. "Wotan placed a hard heart in
\par my breast," says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed
\par from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of not
\par being made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly:
\par "He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one." The noble
\par and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality
\par which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others,
\par or in DESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith
\par in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards
\par "selflessness," belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless
\par scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the "warm heart."--It
\par is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain
\par for invention. The profound reverence for age and for tradition--all law
\par rests on this double reverence,--the belief and prejudice in favour of
\par ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of
\par the powerful; and if, reversely, men of "modern ideas" believe almost
\par instinctively in "progress" and the "future," and are more and more
\par lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these "ideas" has
\par complacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling class,
\par however, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste
\par in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's
\par equals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all
\par that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or "as the heart desires,"
\par and in any case "beyond good and evil": it is here that sympathy and
\par similar sentiments can have a place. The ability and obligation to
\par exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge--both only within the
\par circle of equals,--artfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea
\par in friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the
\par emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance--in fact, in order to be
\par a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble
\par morality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of "modern
\par ideas," and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to
\par unearth and disclose.--It is otherwise with the second type of morality,
\par SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering,
\par the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should
\par moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates?
\par Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of
\par man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with
\par his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the
\par powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of
\par everything "good" that is there honoured--he would fain persuade himself
\par that the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE
\par qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are
\par brought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here that
\par sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence,
\par humility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most
\par useful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of
\par existence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility.
\par Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis "good" and
\par "evil":--power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil,
\par a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not admit of
\par being despised. According to slave-morality, therefore, the "evil" man
\par arouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely the "good"
\par man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is
\par regarded as the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum when,
\par in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a shade
\par of depreciation--it may be slight and well-intentioned--at last attaches
\par itself to the "good" man of this morality; because, according to the
\par servile mode of thought, the good man must in any case be the SAFE
\par man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un
\par bonhomme. Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language
\par shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words "good"
\par and "stupid."--A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM,
\par the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty
\par belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and
\par enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an
\par aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.--Hence we can understand
\par without further detail why love AS A PASSION--it is our European
\par specialty--must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its
\par invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant,
\par ingenious men of the "gai saber," to whom Europe owes so much, and
\par almost owes itself.
\par 
\par 261. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for
\par a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another
\par kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is
\par to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of
\par themselves which they themselves do not possess--and consequently also
\par do not "deserve,"--and who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion
\par afterwards. This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so
\par self-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable,
\par that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful
\par about it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say, for
\par instance: "I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand
\par may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others
\par precisely as I rate it:--that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit,
\par or, in most cases, that which is called 'humility,' and also
\par 'modesty')." Or he will even say: "For many reasons I can delight in
\par the good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour them,
\par and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion
\par endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps
\par because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do not share
\par it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:--all this, however,
\par is not vanity." The man of noble character must first bring it home
\par forcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from
\par time immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary
\par man WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:--not being at all accustomed to
\par fix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value than that
\par which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to
\par create values). It may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary
\par atavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still always WAITING
\par for an opinion about himself, and then instinctively submitting himself
\par to it; yet by no means only to a "good" opinion, but also to a bad
\par and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of the
\par self-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn
\par from their confessors, and which in general the believing Christian
\par learns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the
\par democratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood
\par of masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of
\par the masters to assign a value to themselves and to "think well" of
\par themselves, will now be more and more encouraged and extended; but
\par it has at all times an older, ampler, and more radically ingrained
\par propensity opposed to it--and in the phenomenon of "vanity" this older
\par propensity overmasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERY
\par good opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point
\par of view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or
\par falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects
\par himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by that oldest
\par instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.--It is "the slave"
\par in the vain man's blood, the remains of the slave's craftiness--and how
\par much of the "slave" is still left in woman, for instance!--which
\par seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who
\par immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions, as
\par though he had not called them forth.--And to repeat it again: vanity is
\par an atavism.
\par 
\par 262. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in
\par the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions. On
\par the other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species
\par which receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of
\par protection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop
\par variations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in
\par monstrous vices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say
\par an ancient Greek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary
\par contrivance for the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men
\par beside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to make
\par their species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or else
\par run the terrible danger of being exterminated. The favour, the
\par super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which variations
\par are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as something which,
\par precisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of
\par structure, can in general prevail and make itself permanent in
\par constant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious or
\par rebellion-threatening vassals. The most varied experience teaches it
\par what are the qualities to which it principally owes the fact that
\par it still exists, in spite of all Gods and men, and has hitherto been
\par victorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone
\par it develops to maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires
\par severity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education
\par of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the
\par relations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only
\par for the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues,
\par under the name of "justice." A type with few, but very marked features,
\par a species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent
\par men (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and
\par nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the vicissitudes
\par of generations; the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE
\par conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type becoming
\par stable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of things results, the
\par enormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among the
\par neighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the enjoyment
\par of life, are present in superabundance. With one stroke the bond and
\par constraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as
\par necessary, as a condition of existence--if it would continue, it can
\par only do so as a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations,
\par whether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or
\par deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the
\par greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual
\par and detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifest
\par themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a
\par magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a
\par kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary
\par decay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly
\par exploding egoisms, which strive with one another "for sun and light,"
\par and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for
\par themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. It was this
\par morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously, which bent
\par the bow in so threatening a manner:--it is now "out of date," it is
\par getting "out of date." The dangerous and disquieting point has been
\par reached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS
\par LIVED BEYOND the old morality; the "individual" stands out, and is
\par obliged to have recourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and
\par artifices for self-preservation, self-elevation, and self-deliverance.
\par Nothing but new "Whys," nothing but new "Hows," no common formulas any
\par longer, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay,
\par deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the
\par genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad,
\par a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn, full of new charms
\par and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied
\par corruption. Danger is again present, the mother of morality, great
\par danger; this time shifted into the individual, into the neighbour and
\par friend, into the street, into their own child, into their own heart,
\par into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and
\par volitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have
\par to preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers, that the
\par end is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays and
\par produces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow,
\par except one species of man, the incurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone
\par have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves--they will
\par be the men of the future, the sole survivors; "be like them! become
\par mediocre!" is now the only morality which has still a significance,
\par which still obtains a hearing.--But it is difficult to preach this
\par morality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it
\par desires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly
\par love--it will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!
\par 
\par 263. There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else is
\par already the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES
\par of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. The
\par refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test
\par when something passes by that is of the highest rank, but is not
\par yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and
\par incivilities: something that goes its way like a living touchstone,
\par undistinguished, undiscovered, and tentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled
\par and disguised. He whose task and practice it is to investigate souls,
\par will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the
\par ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which
\par it belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE. DIFFERENCE
\par ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like
\par dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any
\par book bearing the marks of great destiny, is brought before it; while
\par on the other hand, there is an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the
\par eye, a cessation of all gestures, by which it is indicated that a soul
\par FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect. The way in which, on
\par the whole, the reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained
\par in Europe, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of
\par manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such profoundness
\par and supreme significance require for their protection an external
\par tyranny of authority, in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousands of
\par years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. Much has been
\par achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses
\par (the shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not
\par allowed to touch everything, that there are holy experiences before
\par which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand--it
\par is almost their highest advance towards humanity. On the contrary, in
\par the so-called cultured classes, the believers in "modern ideas," nothing
\par is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy insolence of
\par eye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger everything; and it
\par is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste, and
\par more tact for reverence among the people, among the lower classes of
\par the people, especially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading
\par DEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class.
\par 
\par 264. It cannot be effaced from a man's soul what his ancestors have
\par preferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent
\par economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like
\par in their desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were
\par accustomed to commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures
\par and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether,
\par finally, at one time or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of
\par birth and possession, in order to live wholly for their faith--for their
\par "God,"--as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which blushes
\par at every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have
\par the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his
\par constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. This is
\par the problem of race. Granted that one knows something of the parents,
\par it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind
\par of offensive incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy
\par self-vaunting--the three things which together have constituted the
\par genuine plebeian type in all times--such must pass over to the child, as
\par surely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and culture
\par one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.--And
\par what else does education and culture try to do nowadays! In our very
\par democratic, or rather, very plebeian age, "education" and "culture" MUST
\par be essentially the art of deceiving--deceiving with regard to origin,
\par with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul. An educator
\par who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else, and called out
\par constantly to his pupils: "Be true! Be natural! Show yourselves as you
\par are!"--even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time
\par to have recourse to the FURCA of Horace, NATURAM EXPELLERE: with what
\par results? "Plebeianism" USQUE RECURRET. [FOOTNOTE: Horace's "Epistles,"
\par I. x. 24.]
\par 
\par 265. At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism
\par belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief
\par that to a being such as "we," other beings must naturally be in
\par subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the
\par fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of
\par harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something
\par that may have its basis in the primary law of things:--if he sought a
\par designation for it he would say: "It is justice itself." He acknowledges
\par under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that
\par there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this
\par question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged
\par ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect,
\par which he enjoys in intercourse with himself--in accordance with an
\par innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. It is an
\par ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation
\par in intercourse with his equals--every star is a similar egoist; he
\par honours HIMSELF in them, and in the rights which he concedes to them, he
\par has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as the ESSENCE of
\par all intercourse, belongs also to the natural condition of things. The
\par noble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate and sensitive
\par instinct of requital, which is at the root of his nature. The notion of
\par "favour" has, INTER PARES, neither significance nor good repute; there
\par may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from
\par above, and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those
\par arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude. His egoism hinders him
\par here: in general, he looks "aloft" unwillingly--he looks either FORWARD,
\par horizontally and deliberately, or downwards--HE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A
\par HEIGHT.
\par 
\par 266. "One can only truly esteem him who does not LOOK OUT FOR
\par himself."--Goethe to Rath Schlosser.
\par 
\par 267. The Chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children:
\par "SIAO-SIN" ("MAKE THY HEART SMALL"). This is the essentially fundamental
\par tendency in latter-day civilizations. I have no doubt that an ancient
\par Greek, also, would first of all remark the self-dwarfing in us Europeans
\par of today--in this respect alone we should immediately be "distasteful"
\par to him.
\par 
\par 268. What, after all, is ignobleness?--Words are vocal symbols for
\par ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols
\par for frequently returning and concurring sensations, for groups of
\par sensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words in order to
\par understand one another: we must also employ the same words for the same
\par kind of internal experiences, we must in the end have experiences IN
\par COMMON. On this account the people of one nation understand one another
\par better than those belonging to different nations, even when they use
\par the same language; or rather, when people have lived long together under
\par similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there
\par ORIGINATES therefrom an entity that "understands itself"--namely, a
\par nation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences
\par have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about
\par these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more
\par rapidly--the history of language is the history of a process of
\par abbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people always
\par unite closer and closer. The greater the danger, the greater is the
\par need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not to
\par misunderstand one another in danger--that is what cannot at all be
\par dispensed with in intercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one has
\par the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery
\par has been made that in using the same words, one of the two parties has
\par feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears different from those of
\par the other. (The fear of the "eternal misunderstanding": that is the good
\par genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from too
\par hasty attachments, to which sense and heart prompt them--and NOT some
\par Schopenhauerian "genius of the species"!) Whichever groups of sensations
\par within a soul awaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the word of
\par command--these decide as to the general order of rank of its values, and
\par determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A man's estimates of
\par value betray something of the STRUCTURE of his soul, and wherein it
\par sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic needs. Supposing now that
\par necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could
\par express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols,
\par it results on the whole that the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need,
\par which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and COMMON
\par experiences, must have been the most potent of all the forces which
\par have hitherto operated upon mankind. The more similar, the more ordinary
\par people, have always had and are still having the advantage; the more
\par select, more refined, more unique, and difficultly comprehensible, are
\par liable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation, and
\par seldom propagate themselves. One must appeal to immense opposing forces,
\par in order to thwart this natural, all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE,
\par the evolution of man to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the
\par gregarious--to the IGNOBLE--!
\par 
\par 269. The more a psychologist--a born, an unavoidable psychologist
\par and soul-diviner--turns his attention to the more select cases and
\par individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy:
\par he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For
\par the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually
\par constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a
\par rule always before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist
\par who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then
\par discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history, this universal
\par inner "desperateness" of higher men, this eternal "too late!" in every
\par sense--may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with
\par bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at
\par self-destruction--of his "going to ruin" himself. One may perceive
\par in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful
\par intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby
\par disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort
\par of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and
\par incisiveness--from what his "business"--has laid upon his conscience.
\par The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the
\par judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour,
\par admire, love, and glorify, where he has PERCEIVED--or he even conceals
\par his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps
\par the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely
\par where he has learnt GREAT SYMPATHY, together with great CONTEMPT, the
\par multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt
\par great reverence--reverence for "great men" and marvelous animals, for
\par the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the earth, the
\par dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young,
\par and in view of whom one educates them. And who knows but in all great
\par instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped
\par a God, and that the "God" was only a poor sacrificial animal! SUCCESS
\par has always been the greatest liar--and the "work" itself is a success;
\par the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in
\par their creations until they are unrecognizable; the "work" of the artist,
\par of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is REPUTED
\par to have created it; the "great men," as they are reverenced, are poor
\par little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values
\par spurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets, for example, such as
\par Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention
\par much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and
\par were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous,
\par and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust;
\par with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking
\par revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking
\par forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in
\par the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the
\par Will-o'-the-Wisps around the swamps, and PRETEND TO BE stars--the people
\par then call them idealists,--often struggling with protracted disgust,
\par with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold,
\par and obliges them to languish for GLORIA and devour "faith as it is"
\par out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:--what a TORMENT these great
\par artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once
\par found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from woman--who
\par is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager
\par to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers--that THEY have
\par learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted SYMPATHY, which
\par the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand,
\par and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This
\par sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would
\par like to believe that love can do EVERYTHING--it is the SUPERSTITION
\par peculiar to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor,
\par helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love
\par is--he finds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!--It is possible that
\par under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden
\par one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE:
\par the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that
\par never had enough of any human love, that DEMANDED love, that demanded
\par inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible
\par outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor
\par soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send
\par thither those who WOULD NOT love him--and that at last, enlightened
\par about human love, had to invent a God who is entire love, entire
\par CAPACITY for love--who takes pity on human love, because it is so
\par paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such
\par KNOWLEDGE about love--SEEKS for death!--But why should one deal with
\par such painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do
\par so.
\par 
\par 270. The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who has
\par suffered deeply--it almost determines the order of rank HOW deeply men
\par can suffer--the chilling certainty, with which he is thoroughly imbued
\par and coloured, that by virtue of his suffering he KNOWS MORE than the
\par shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that he has been familiar with,
\par and "at home" in, many distant, dreadful worlds of which "YOU know
\par nothing"!--this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer, this
\par pride of the elect of knowledge, of the "initiated," of the almost
\par sacrificed, finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from
\par contact with officious and sympathizing hands, and in general from all
\par that is not its equal in suffering. Profound suffering makes noble:
\par it separates.--One of the most refined forms of disguise is Epicurism,
\par along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste, which takes
\par suffering lightly, and puts itself on the defensive against all that
\par is sorrowful and profound. They are "gay men" who make use of gaiety,
\par because they are misunderstood on account of it--they WISH to be
\par misunderstood. There are "scientific minds" who make use of science,
\par because it gives a gay appearance, and because scientificness leads to
\par the conclusion that a person is superficial--they WISH to mislead to a
\par false conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would fain conceal
\par and deny that they are broken, proud, incurable hearts (the cynicism of
\par Hamlet--the case of Galiani); and occasionally folly itself is the mask
\par of an unfortunate OVER-ASSURED knowledge.--From which it follows that it
\par is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence "for the mask,"
\par and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.
\par 
\par 271. That which separates two men most profoundly is a different sense
\par and grade of purity. What does it matter about all their honesty and
\par reciprocal usefulness, what does it matter about all their mutual
\par good-will: the fact still remains--they "cannot smell each other!" The
\par highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the
\par most extraordinary and dangerous isolation, as a saint: for it is just
\par holiness--the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question. Any
\par kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath,
\par any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out
\par of night into the morning, and out of gloom, out of "affliction" into
\par clearness, brightness, depth, and refinement:--just as much as such a
\par tendency DISTINGUISHES--it is a noble tendency--it also SEPARATES.--The
\par pity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the human, all-too-human.
\par And there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him as
\par impurity, as filth.
\par 
\par 272. Signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to the
\par rank of duties for everybody; to be unwilling to renounce or to share
\par our responsibilities; to count our prerogatives, and the exercise of
\par them, among our DUTIES.
\par 
\par 273. A man who strives after great things, looks upon every one whom
\par he encounters on his way either as a means of advance, or a delay and
\par hindrance--or as a temporary resting-place. His peculiar lofty BOUNTY
\par to his fellow-men is only possible when he attains his elevation and
\par dominates. Impatience, and the consciousness of being always condemned
\par to comedy up to that time--for even strife is a comedy, and conceals the
\par end, as every means does--spoil all intercourse for him; this kind of
\par man is acquainted with solitude, and what is most poisonous in it.
\par 
\par 274. THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO WAIT.--Happy chances are necessary, and
\par many incalculable elements, in order that a higher man in whom the
\par solution of a problem is dormant, may yet take action, or "break forth,"
\par as one might say--at the right moment. On an average it DOES NOT happen;
\par and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who
\par hardly know to what extent they are waiting, and still less that they
\par wait in vain. Occasionally, too, the waking call comes too late--the
\par chance which gives "permission" to take action--when their best youth,
\par and strength for action have been used up in sitting still; and how many
\par a one, just as he "sprang up," has found with horror that his limbs are
\par benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy! "It is too late," he has
\par said to himself--and has become self-distrustful and henceforth for ever
\par useless.--In the domain of genius, may not the "Raphael without
\par hands" (taking the expression in its widest sense) perhaps not be the
\par exception, but the rule?--Perhaps genius is by no means so rare: but
\par rather the five hundred HANDS which it requires in order to tyrannize
\par over the [GREEK INSERTED HERE], "the right time"--in order to take
\par chance by the forelock!
\par 
\par 275. He who does not WISH to see the height of a man, looks all the
\par more sharply at what is low in him, and in the foreground--and thereby
\par betrays himself.
\par 
\par 276. In all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is
\par better off than the nobler soul: the dangers of the latter must be
\par greater, the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in
\par fact immense, considering the multiplicity of the conditions of its
\par existence.--In a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost; not so
\par in man.--
\par 
\par 277. It is too bad! Always the old story! When a man has finished
\par building his house, he finds that he has learnt unawares something
\par which he OUGHT absolutely to have known before he--began to build. The
\par eternal, fatal "Too late!" The melancholia of everything COMPLETED--!
\par 
\par 278.--Wanderer, who art thou? I see thee follow thy path without scorn,
\par without love, with unfathomable eyes, wet and sad as a plummet which has
\par returned to the light insatiated out of every depth--what did it seek
\par down there?--with a bosom that never sighs, with lips that conceal their
\par loathing, with a hand which only slowly grasps: who art thou? what
\par hast thou done? Rest thee here: this place has hospitality for every
\par one--refresh thyself! And whoever thou art, what is it that now pleases
\par thee? What will serve to refresh thee? Only name it, whatever I have
\par I offer thee! "To refresh me? To refresh me? Oh, thou prying one,
\par what sayest thou! But give me, I pray thee---" What? what? Speak out!
\par "Another mask! A second mask!"
\par 
\par 279. Men of profound sadness betray themselves when they are happy: they
\par have a mode of seizing upon happiness as though they would choke and
\par strangle it, out of jealousy--ah, they know only too well that it will
\par flee from them!
\par 
\par 280. "Bad! Bad! What? Does he not--go back?" Yes! But you misunderstand
\par him when you complain about it. He goes back like every one who is about
\par to make a great spring.
\par 
\par 281.--"Will people believe it of me? But I insist that they believe it
\par of me: I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about
\par myself, only in very rare cases, only compulsorily, always without
\par delight in 'the subject,' ready to digress from 'myself,' and always
\par without faith in the result, owing to an unconquerable distrust of the
\par POSSIBILITY of self-knowledge, which has led me so far as to feel a
\par CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO even in the idea of 'direct knowledge' which
\par theorists allow themselves:--this matter of fact is almost the most
\par certain thing I know about myself. There must be a sort of repugnance
\par in me to BELIEVE anything definite about myself.--Is there perhaps
\par some enigma therein? Probably; but fortunately nothing for my own
\par teeth.--Perhaps it betrays the species to which I belong?--but not to
\par myself, as is sufficiently agreeable to me."
\par 
\par 282.--"But what has happened to you?"--"I do not know," he said,
\par hesitatingly; "perhaps the Harpies have flown over my table."--It
\par sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle, sober, retiring man becomes
\par suddenly mad, breaks the plates, upsets the table, shrieks, raves,
\par and shocks everybody--and finally withdraws, ashamed, and raging at
\par himself--whither? for what purpose? To famish apart? To suffocate with
\par his memories?--To him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul,
\par and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared, the danger
\par will always be great--nowadays, however, it is extraordinarily so.
\par Thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age, with which he does
\par not like to eat out of the same dish, he may readily perish of hunger
\par and thirst--or, should he nevertheless finally "fall to," of sudden
\par nausea.--We have probably all sat at tables to which we did not belong;
\par and precisely the most spiritual of us, who are most difficult to
\par nourish, know the dangerous DYSPEPSIA which originates from a sudden
\par insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmates--the
\par AFTER-DINNER NAUSEA.
\par 
\par 283. If one wishes to praise at all, it is a delicate and at the
\par same time a noble self-control, to praise only where one DOES NOT
\par agree--otherwise in fact one would praise oneself, which is contrary
\par to good taste:--a self-control, to be sure, which offers excellent
\par opportunity and provocation to constant MISUNDERSTANDING. To be able to
\par allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality, one must
\par not live among intellectual imbeciles, but rather among men whose
\par misunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement--or one will
\par have to pay dearly for it!--"He praises me, THEREFORE he acknowledges me
\par to be right"--this asinine method of inference spoils half of the life
\par of us recluses, for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and
\par friendship.
\par 
\par 284. To live in a vast and proud tranquility; always beyond... To have,
\par or not to have, one's emotions, one's For and Against, according to
\par choice; to lower oneself to them for hours; to SEAT oneself on them as
\par upon horses, and often as upon asses:--for one must know how to make
\par use of their stupidity as well as of their fire. To conserve one's
\par three hundred foregrounds; also one's black spectacles: for there are
\par circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes, still less into our
\par "motives." And to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice,
\par politeness. And to remain master of one's four virtues, courage,
\par insight, sympathy, and solitude. For solitude is a virtue with us, as
\par a sublime bent and bias to purity, which divines that in the contact of
\par man and man--"in society"--it must be unavoidably impure. All society
\par makes one somehow, somewhere, or sometime--"commonplace."
\par 
\par 285. The greatest events and thoughts--the greatest thoughts, however,
\par are the greatest events--are longest in being comprehended: the
\par generations which are contemporary with them do not EXPERIENCE such
\par events--they live past them. Something happens there as in the realm of
\par stars. The light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man; and
\par before it has arrived man DENIES--that there are stars there. "How
\par many centuries does a mind require to be understood?"--that is also a
\par standard, one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith,
\par such as is necessary for mind and for star.
\par 
\par 286. "Here is the prospect free, the mind exalted." [FOOTNOTE: Goethe's
\par "Faust," Part II, Act V. The words of Dr. Marianus.]--But there is a
\par reverse kind of man, who is also upon a height, and has also a free
\par prospect--but looks DOWNWARDS.
\par 
\par 287. What is noble? What does the word "noble" still mean for us
\par nowadays? How does the noble man betray himself, how is he recognized
\par under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism, by which
\par everything is rendered opaque and leaden?--It is not his actions which
\par establish his claim--actions are always ambiguous, always inscrutable;
\par neither is it his "works." One finds nowadays among artists and scholars
\par plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for
\par nobleness impels them; but this very NEED of nobleness is radically
\par different from the needs of the noble soul itself, and is in fact the
\par eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. It is not the works,
\par but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of
\par rank--to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper
\par meaning--it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about
\par itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and
\par perhaps, also, is not to be lost.--THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR
\par ITSELF.--
\par 
\par 288. There are men who are unavoidably intellectual, let them turn
\par and twist themselves as they will, and hold their hands before their
\par treacherous eyes--as though the hand were not a betrayer; it always
\par comes out at last that they have something which they hide--namely,
\par intellect. One of the subtlest means of deceiving, at least as long as
\par possible, and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider
\par than one really is--which in everyday life is often as desirable as
\par an umbrella,--is called ENTHUSIASM, including what belongs to it, for
\par instance, virtue. For as Galiani said, who was obliged to know it: VERTU
\par EST ENTHOUSIASME.
\par 
\par 289. In the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo
\par of the wilderness, something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance
\par of solitude; in his strongest words, even in his cry itself, there
\par sounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence, of concealment. He who
\par has sat day and night, from year's end to year's end, alone with his
\par soul in familiar discord and discourse, he who has become a cave-bear,
\par or a treasure-seeker, or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave--it
\par may be a labyrinth, but can also be a gold-mine--his ideas themselves
\par eventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own, and an odour, as much
\par of the depth as of the mould, something uncommunicative and repulsive,
\par which blows chilly upon every passer-by. The recluse does not believe
\par that a philosopher--supposing that a philosopher has always in the first
\par place been a recluse--ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in
\par books: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us?--indeed,
\par he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have "ultimate and actual"
\par opinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must
\par necessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer
\par world beyond the surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every
\par "foundation." Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy--this is a
\par recluse's verdict: "There is something arbitrary in the fact that the
\par PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here, took a retrospect, and looked around;
\par that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper--there
\par is also something suspicious in it." Every philosophy also CONCEALS a
\par philosophy; every opinion is also a LURKING-PLACE, every word is also a
\par MASK.
\par 
\par 290. Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being
\par misunderstood. The latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but the former
\par wounds his heart, his sympathy, which always says: "Ah, why would you
\par also have as hard a time of it as I have?"
\par 
\par 291. Man, a COMPLEX, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal, uncanny
\par to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather than by his
\par strength, has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his
\par soul as something SIMPLE; and the whole of morality is a long, audacious
\par falsification, by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of
\par the soul becomes possible. From this point of view there is perhaps much
\par more in the conception of "art" than is generally believed.
\par 
\par 292. A philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences, sees,
\par hears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck
\par by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside, from above and
\par below, as a species of events and lightning-flashes PECULIAR TO HIM; who
\par is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentous
\par man, around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and
\par something uncanny going on. A philosopher: alas, a being who often
\par runs away from himself, is often afraid of himself--but whose curiosity
\par always makes him "come to himself" again.
\par 
\par 293. A man who says: "I like that, I take it for my own, and mean to
\par guard and protect it from every one"; a man who can conduct a case,
\par carry out a resolution, remain true to an opinion, keep hold of a woman,
\par punish and overthrow insolence; a man who has his indignation and his
\par sword, and to whom the weak, the suffering, the oppressed, and even the
\par animals willingly submit and naturally belong; in short, a man who is a
\par MASTER by nature--when such a man has sympathy, well! THAT sympathy has
\par value! But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer! Or of
\par those even who preach sympathy! There is nowadays, throughout almost the
\par whole of Europe, a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain,
\par and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining, an effeminizing,
\par which, with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense, seeks
\par to deck itself out as something superior--there is a regular cult of
\par suffering. The UNMANLINESS of that which is called "sympathy" by such
\par groups of visionaries, is always, I believe, the first thing that
\par strikes the eye.--One must resolutely and radically taboo this latest
\par form of bad taste; and finally I wish people to put the good amulet,
\par "GAI SABER" ("gay science," in ordinary language), on heart and neck, as
\par a protection against it.
\par 
\par 294. THE OLYMPIAN VICE.--Despite the philosopher who, as a genuine
\par Englishman, tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking
\par minds--"Laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature, which every
\par thinking mind will strive to overcome" (Hobbes),--I would even
\par allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their
\par laughing--up to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter. And supposing
\par that Gods also philosophize, which I am strongly inclined to believe,
\par owing to many reasons--I have no doubt that they also know how to laugh
\par thereby in an overman-like and new fashion--and at the expense of all
\par serious things! Gods are fond of ridicule: it seems that they cannot
\par refrain from laughter even in holy matters.
\par 
\par 295. The genius of the heart, as that great mysterious one possesses
\par it, the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences, whose voice can
\par descend into the nether-world of every soul, who neither speaks a word
\par nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch
\par of allurement, to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to
\par appear,--not as he is, but in a guise which acts as an ADDITIONAL
\par constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him, to follow him
\par more cordially and thoroughly;--the genius of the heart, which imposes
\par silence and attention on everything loud and self-conceited, which
\par smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing--to lie placid
\par as a mirror, that the deep heavens may be reflected in them;--the genius
\par of the heart, which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate,
\par and to grasp more delicately; which scents the hidden and forgotten
\par treasure, the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark
\par ice, and is a divining-rod for every grain of gold, long buried and
\par imprisoned in mud and sand; the genius of the heart, from contact with
\par which every one goes away richer; not favoured or surprised, not as
\par though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richer
\par in himself, newer than before, broken up, blown upon, and sounded by a
\par thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more fragile, more
\par bruised, but full of hopes which as yet lack names, full of a new will
\par and current, full of a new ill-will and counter-current... but what am I
\par doing, my friends? Of whom am I talking to you? Have I forgotten myself
\par so far that I have not even told you his name? Unless it be that you
\par have already divined of your own accord who this questionable God
\par and spirit is, that wishes to be PRAISED in such a manner? For, as it
\par happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his
\par legs, and in foreign lands, I have also encountered on my path many
\par strange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and again and again,
\par the one of whom I have just spoken: in fact, no less a personage than
\par the God DIONYSUS, the great equivocator and tempter, to whom, as you
\par know, I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruits--the
\par last, as it seems to me, who has offered a SACRIFICE to him, for I
\par have found no one who could understand what I was then doing. In
\par the meantime, however, I have learned much, far too much, about the
\par philosophy of this God, and, as I said, from mouth to mouth--I, the last
\par disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last
\par begin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little taste of
\par this philosophy? In a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do
\par with much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny. The
\par very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also
\par philosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might
\par perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;--among you, my
\par friends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too
\par late and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you
\par are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may happen, too, that
\par in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the
\par strict usages of your ears? Certainly the God in question went further,
\par very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of
\par me... Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him, according
\par to human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should
\par have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless
\par honesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But such a God does not know
\par what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. "Keep that," he
\par would say, "for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require
\par it! I--have no reason to cover my nakedness!" One suspects that this
\par kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?--He once said:
\par "Under certain circumstances I love mankind"--and referred thereby to
\par Ariadne, who was present; "in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave,
\par inventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way
\par even through all labyrinths. I like man, and often think how I can
\par still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more
\par profound."--"Stronger, more evil, and more profound?" I asked in horror.
\par "Yes," he said again, "stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more
\par beautiful"--and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile,
\par as though he had just paid some charming compliment. One here sees at
\par once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;--and in general
\par there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could
\par all of them come to us men for instruction. We men are--more human.--
\par 
\par 296. Alas! what are you, after all, my written and painted thoughts! Not
\par long ago you were so variegated, young and malicious, so full of thorns
\par and secret spices, that you made me sneeze and laugh--and now? You
\par have already doffed your novelty, and some of you, I fear, are ready
\par to become truths, so immortal do they look, so pathetically honest, so
\par tedious! And was it ever otherwise? What then do we write and paint,
\par we mandarins with Chinese brush, we immortalisers of things which LEND
\par themselves to writing, what are we alone capable of painting? Alas, only
\par that which is just about to fade and begins to lose its odour! Alas,
\par only exhausted and departing storms and belated yellow sentiments! Alas,
\par only birds strayed and fatigued by flight, which now let themselves be
\par captured with the hand--with OUR hand! We immortalize what cannot live
\par and fly much longer, things only which are exhausted and mellow! And it
\par is only for your AFTERNOON, you, my written and painted thoughts, for
\par which alone I have colours, many colours, perhaps, many variegated
\par softenings, and fifty yellows and browns and greens and reds;--but
\par nobody will divine thereby how ye looked in your morning, you sudden
\par sparks and marvels of my solitude, you, my old, beloved--EVIL thoughts!

\par                        1.
\par 
\par      MIDDAY of Life! Oh, season of delight!
\par                       My summer's park!
\par      Uneaseful joy to look, to lurk, to hark--
\par      I peer for friends, am ready day and night,--
\par      Where linger ye, my friends? The time is right!
\par 
\par                        2.
\par 
\par      Is not the glacier's grey today for you
\par                          Rose-garlanded?
\par      The brooklet seeks you, wind, cloud, with longing thread
\par      And thrust themselves yet higher to the blue,
\par      To spy for you from farthest eagle's view.
\par 
\par                        3.
\par 
\par      My table was spread out for you on high--
\par                       Who dwelleth so
\par      Star-near, so near the grisly pit below?--
\par      My realm--what realm hath wider boundary?
\par      My honey--who hath sipped its fragrancy?
\par 
\par                        4.
\par 
\par      Friends, ye are there! Woe me,--yet I am not
\par                         He whom ye seek?
\par      Ye stare and stop--better your wrath could speak!
\par      I am not I? Hand, gait, face, changed? And what
\par      I am, to you my friends, now am I not?
\par 
\par                        5.
\par 
\par      Am I an other? Strange am I to Me?
\par                       Yet from Me sprung?
\par      A wrestler, by himself too oft self-wrung?
\par      Hindering too oft my own self's potency,
\par      Wounded and hampered by self-victory?
\par 
\par                        6.
\par 
\par      I sought where-so the wind blows keenest. There
\par                      I learned to dwell
\par      Where no man dwells, on lonesome ice-lorn fell,
\par      And unlearned Man and God and curse and prayer?
\par      Became a ghost haunting the glaciers bare?
\par 
\par                        7.
\par 
\par      Ye, my old friends! Look! Ye turn pale, filled o'er
\par                       With love and fear!
\par      Go! Yet not in wrath. Ye could ne'er live here.
\par      Here in the farthest realm of ice and scaur,
\par      A huntsman must one be, like chamois soar.
\par 
\par                        8.
\par 
\par      An evil huntsman was I? See how taut
\par                     My bow was bent!
\par      Strongest was he by whom such bolt were sent--
\par      Woe now! That arrow is with peril fraught,
\par      Perilous as none.--Have yon safe home ye sought!
\par 
\par                        9.
\par 
\par      Ye go! Thou didst endure enough, oh, heart;--
\par                      Strong was thy hope;
\par      Unto new friends thy portals widely ope,
\par      Let old ones be. Bid memory depart!
\par      Wast thou young then, now--better young thou art!
\par 
\par                        10.
\par 
\par      What linked us once together, one hope's tie--
\par                     (Who now doth con
\par      Those lines, now fading, Love once wrote thereon?)--
\par      Is like a parchment, which the hand is shy
\par      To touch--like crackling leaves, all seared, all dry.
\par 
\par                        11.
\par 
\par      Oh! Friends no more! They are--what name for those?--
\par                            Friends' phantom-flight
\par      Knocking at my heart's window-pane at night,
\par      Gazing on me, that speaks "We were" and goes,--
\par      Oh, withered words, once fragrant as the rose!
\par 
\par                        12.
\par 
\par      Pinings of youth that might not understand!
\par                        For which I pined,
\par      Which I deemed changed with me, kin of my kind:
\par      But they grew old, and thus were doomed and banned:
\par      None but new kith are native of my land!
\par 
\par                        13.
\par 
\par      Midday of life! My second youth's delight!
\par                        My summer's park!
\par      Unrestful joy to long, to lurk, to hark!
\par      I peer for friends!--am ready day and night,
\par      For my new friends. Come! Come! The time is right!
\par 
\par                        14.
\par 
\par      This song is done,--the sweet sad cry of rue
\par                        Sang out its end;
\par      A wizard wrought it, he the timely friend,
\par      The midday-friend,--no, do not ask me who;
\par      At midday 'twas, when one became as two.
\par 
\par                        15.
\par 
\par      We keep our Feast of Feasts, sure of our bourne,
\par                       Our aims self-same:
\par      The Guest of Guests, friend Zarathustra, came!
\par      The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,
\par      And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn.}{\rtlch\fcs1 \af2 \ltrch\fcs0 \f2
